# SIGMA Announces 24-70mm F2.8 DG DN II | Art Lens, an Upgraded Follow-Up to its Popular Standard Zoom for Full-Frame Mirrorless Cameras

--News Direct--

SIGMA Corporation of America, the US subsidiary of SIGMA Corporation (CEO: Kazuto Yamaki. Headquarters: Asao-ku, Kawasaki-shi, Kanagawa, Japan) is pleased to announce the SIGMA 24-70mm F2.8 DG DN II | Art lens. This is the second generation of the highly successful SIGMA 24-70mm F2.8 DG DN | Art. The new lens has undergone a significant evolution, including enhanced optical performance, AF speed and operability, while also achieving a more compact size than the original.

The advancement of optical design has shortened the total optical length, and the lens barrel has been made slimmer by thoroughly downsizing the zoom mechanism. In addition, the lens barrel has been downsized by placing buttons and switches directly on the lens barrel. The weight has been reduced by approximately 10% compared to the SIGMA 24-70mm F2.8 DG DN | Art. By driving the lightweight focus group with the high-thrust HLA, autofocus is significantly swifter than the original version.

6 FLD glass elements, 2 SLD glass elements, and 5 double-sided aspheric lenses are used. Aberrations are highly corrected through advanced optical design made possible by advanced basic technologies in both design and manufacturing, including the use of new glass materials and aspherical lenses with thin walls and high degrees of asphericity. In particular, sagittal coma flare is heavily corrected to achieve MTF characteristics surpassing those of the highly-acclaimed 24-70mm F2.8 DG DN | Art. The high level of flare resistance also results in point images, such as stars, at the periphery of the image being closer to ideal points.

A close-focusing distance of 6.7 inches (17cm) at the wide end at 1:2.7 magnification* adds to the versatility of this lens, and the addition of a click/de-click and lockable aperture ring, along with an additional AF-L button for vertical orientation still or video capture, are additional enhancements of this second-generation lens. The zoom lock switch, which disengages when zooming, is inherited from the SIGMA 24-70mm F2.8 DG DN | Art. Manual focus can be switched between Linear and Non-linear response (L-Mount only.) A splash- and dust-resistant structure, plus water and oil-repellent coating on the front element, add to durability.

* close-focusing distance of 13.4 inches (34cm) with 1:4 magnification at 70mm

The new SIGMA 24-70mm F2.8 DG DN II | Art lens builds on the success and popularity of the original 24-70mm F2.8 DG DN | Art, and offers an impressive upgrade with added features and performance in a more compact package that is perfect for working pros in both still and video applications. Offered in Sony E-mount and L-Mount, the lens will be available through authorized retailers in late May 2024 and will sell for $1,199.

The Art 24-70mm F2.8, evolved on all levels:

Rendering performance, functionality, and portability.

The SIGMA 24-70mm F2.8 DG DN II | Art is SIGMA's flagship lens that has evolved significantly from the previous model by incorporating the most advanced technologies available to SIGMA from design to production. Compared to the previous SIGMA 24-70mm F2.8 DG DN | Art, the SIGMA 24-70mm F2.8 DG DN II | Art has improved resolving power throughout the entire zoom range, and also benefits from functional enhancements such as the addition of an aperture ring and high-speed AF with a redesigned AF motor, HLA (High-response Linear Actuator). The lens is also approximately 7% smaller and 10% lighter. This 24-70mm F2.8 Art zoom is a versatile and high-performance tool that will help photographers and filmmakers unlock their creative potential.

[Key Features]

1. Rendering performance worthy of the flagship name

The SIGMA 24-70mm F2.8 DG DN II | Art is the successor to the SIGMA 24-70mm F2.8 DG DN | Art, which is known for its high optical performance, and has further improved resolution throughout the zoom range. The lens has high sharpness throughout the entire image from its maximum aperture, even on high-resolution cameras. Focusing on enhancing its rendering performance, the brightness of F2.8 produces a large, beautiful bokeh effect, and allows users to experience the power of a flagship lens in all types of visual expression. In addition to its advanced close-up capability and resistance to flare and ghosting, the lens is designed to minimize focus breathing.

High optical performance across the entire image and zoom range

The optical design of the lens includes 6 FLD glass elements, 2 SLD glass elements, and 5 aspherical lens elements to thoroughly suppress various aberrations throughout the entire zoom range. In particular, sagittal coma flare has been well controlled to achieve consistently high resolution all the way to the periphery of the image. By also effectively correcting lateral chromatic aberration, high resolution, beautifully rendered images can be achieved, free from color fringing can be achieved.

Incorporating 5 aspherical lenses

The use of 5 high-precision aspherical lenses enables both high optical performance with minimal aberration correction and a compact optical design. The SIGMA's only manufacturing base, the Aizu factory’s ultra-high-precision aspherical molding technology makes it possible to produce the thin, highly polarized aspherical lenses that are essential for the construction of this lens. This has brought about a higher degree of freedom in optical design.

Excellent close-up capability

The lens has excellent close-up capability with a minimum focusing distance of 17cm / 6.7in. at the wide end and a maximum magnification ratio of 1:2.7. This is useful when composing close-up shots of a subject, or when shooting in tight spaces where it is difficult to get a good distance from the subject.

* Be extremely careful that the front lens element does not hit the subject when photographing. Remove the lens hood when photographing at the minimum focusing distance at the wide-angle end.

Designed to minimize flare and ghosting

Flare and ghosting, which reduce image quality, have been largely eliminated using advanced simulation technology, ensuring the lens renders rich, high-contrast results in all conditions. In addition, Nano Porous Coating and Super Multi-layer Coating have been applied to help suppress flare and ghosting to the utmost degree. High backlight resistance enables clear and sharp images under any lighting conditions.

Minimal focus breathing

The lens has been designed to suppress focus breathing. The change in angle-of-view due to focus shift across the entire zoom range is minimized, creating a natural-looking focus pulls when recording video.

2. Improved portability and expanded feature set

The body of the SIGMA 24-70mm F2.8 DG DN II | Art is approximately 7% smaller in size and 10% lighter in weight than the previous model, while improving usability by adding an aperture ring and two AFL buttons. Despite the reduction in size and added features, the lens maintains SIGMA’s renowned excellent build quality, with the uncompromisingly precise and robust construction expected of a professional photographic tool.

Highly portable lens body

While the number of lens elements used in its construction is the same as that of the previous model, the overall length has been shortened owing to an advanced optical design. In addition, the more efficient mechanical design has resulted in a highly portable lens body with a maximum diameter of 87.8mm / 3.5in., length of 120.2mm / 4.7in., and weight of 745g / 26.3oz.*

* These figures are for L-Mount.

Excellent build quality

Simultaneously focusing on reducing the size and weight of the lens body, the use of metal parts for the zoom extension unit and other parts, as well as the robust internal structure ensure rigidity during use, such as when operating the ring, pressing buttons, and carrying the lens. The design emphasizes the lens’ longevity and reliability as a tool, which cannot be achieved by solely pursuing a compact and lightweight body.

Equipped with an aperture ring

The lens is equipped with an aperture ring as well as an aperture ring click switch and an aperture ring lock switch, allowing for aperture operation suitable for various shooing situations.

Equipped with two AFL buttons

The lens is equipped with two AFL buttons*, to which a range of functions can be assigned via the menu on selected cameras, one more than the previous model. In addition to the side, the additional button has been positioned on the top to facilitate button operation when the camera is held in vertical orientation.

* Functions can be assigned on supported cameras only. Available functions may vary depending on the camera used.

3. A wealth of functions including high-speed autofocus

In addition to high-speed AF with HLA (High-response Linear Actuator), the SIGMA 24-70mm F2.8 DG DN II | Art has a full range of features including weather resistance such as a dust and splash resistant structure* and water and oil repellent coating, as well as a zoom lock switch. The lens delivers the best possible results in every shooting situation.

* The structure is designed to be dust and splash resistant, but not waterproof. Be careful not to bring the lens in contact with a large amount of water. Water inside the lens may cause major damage and even render the lens unrepairable.

Incorporating a linear motor HLA

The lens incorporates a linear motor HLA (High-response Linear Actuator) for the AF actuator. The high output HLA makes the maximum drive speed more than three times faster than the previous model*, ensuring responsive AF shooting.

* Compared by the maximum drive speed of the SIGMA 24-70mm F2.8 DG DN II | Art with that of the SIGMA 24-70mm F2.8 DG DN | Art (It is different from the actual time for AF to focus).

Dust and splash resistant structure and water and oil repellent coating

In addition to a dust and splash resistant structure, the front element of the lens features a water and oil repellent coating, allowing users to shoot without concerns even in harsh outdoor environments.

Equipped with a zoom lock switch at the wide end

The lens is equipped with a zoom lock switch that locks the lens at the wide end and prevents the barrel from extending unintentionally under its own weight. The lock can be released not only by the switch but also via zoom operation, allowing for flexible handling of even impromptu shooting.

Includes petal-type hood with lock

A dedicated petal-shaped hood is supplied. A locking mechanism is provided for secure attachment.
