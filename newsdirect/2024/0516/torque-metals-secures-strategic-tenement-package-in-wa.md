# Torque Metals secures strategic tenement package in WA

--News Direct--

Torque Metals Ltd (ASX:TOR) managing director Cristian Moreno sits down with Jonathan Jackson in the Proactive studio to discuss the completion of extension drilling at its wholly owned flagship Paris Gold Project, southeast of Kalgoorlie on the gold-rich Boulder-Lefroy Fault Zone. Assay results are imminent and a new drilling phase is being planned. Moreno also talks about an option agreement to acquire a 100% interest in a strategic package of tenements with gold and lithium potential in the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia. This acquisition aligns with the company's strategy to consolidate prospective ground near its Penzance Exploration Camp, which includes the New Dawn lithium and Paris gold discoveries. The tenements span approximately 250 square kilometres, increasing Torque’s project area to around 1,200 square kilometres. This expansion will provide Torque with a dominant position in the region. The tenements are near notable projects such as Lord Resources' Horse Rocks, Future Battery Minerals’ Kangaroo Hills and Mineral Resources’ Mt Marion Lithium Project. These areas share similar geological characteristics, primarily greenstone belts with adjacent intrusions, indicating strong potential for gold and lithium. Torque has also applied for additional tenements to expand its New Dawn Lithium Project. Moreno highlighted that upon exercising the options, Torque would secure 100% ownership of the tenements, enhancing its portfolio to include 13 mining, four prospecting and 38 exploration licences. The company has initiated geological mapping and sampling at new target areas, preparing for initial drilling campaigns.
