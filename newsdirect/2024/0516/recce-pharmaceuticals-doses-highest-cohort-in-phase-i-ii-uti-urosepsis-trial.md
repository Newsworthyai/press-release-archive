# Recce Pharmaceuticals doses highest cohort in phase I/II UTI/Urosepsis trial

--News Direct--

Recce Pharmaceuticals Ltd (ASX:RCE, OTC:RECEF) managing director and CEO James Graham talks with Proactive’s Jonathan Jackson about how Recce has administered the first doses in the latest cohort of its Phase I/II clinical trial for urinary tract infection (UTI) and urosepsis treatment with RECCE® 327 (R327). Both male and female participants received R327 at 4,000mg intravenously (I.V.) over 20 minutes, marking the highest dosage in this trial to date. R327, an intravenous and topical therapy, is being developed to treat serious infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including their superbug forms. The clinical trial has explored various infusion times for R327, including 15, 20, 30 and 45 minutes, across different dosage levels. This latest cohort involves the highest dose of 4,000mg, with Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) activity against bacteria identified in existing clinical samples. This dose optimisation is significant for regulatory purposes. Remaining participants will be dosed in the coming days, and the full potential of R327 via I.V. administration will be evaluated upon completion of the trial.
