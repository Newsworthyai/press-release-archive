Singapore, November 19, 2024 — Leading blockchain data provider Nansen announced its collaboration with TRON DAO, a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps. TRON, the trusted network for developers, institutions, and individuals worldwide, will be fully integrated on Nansen 2. This collaboration aims to supercharge the TRON ecosystem by providing users and developers with unparalleled insights into on-chain data.

TRON is a decentralized blockchain network that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps). Powered by smart contracts and a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, TRON offers high speed, scalability, and low fees. The TRON Virtual Machine (TVM) provides a robust environment for efficient smart contract execution and migration from Ethereum with a resource model allowing users to reduce on-chain gas fees to $0 or near $0.

With its versatile capabilities, TRON has become a leading blockchain, supporting a wide range of use cases including payments, gaming, multimedia, art, and DeFi.

"Nansen is thrilled to collaborate with TRON DAO. TRON's unique architecture combines high speed, scalability, and low fees with a user-friendly interface, making it a powerhouse in the blockchain space. By bringing Nansen's cutting-edge, real-time analytics to this rapidly growing ecosystem, we're empowering users to unlock the platform’s full potential. This collaboration is a testament to our shared commitment to driving growth and adoption in the blockchain space." - Alex Svanevik, CEO of Nansen.

"The TRON network is a leader in blockchain innovation, and the integration with Nansen will improve how developers and the community interact with the ecosystem. With advanced analytics and on-chain data insights, developers will have access to more tools and resources to build and optimize their DApps, while enabling greater transparency within the community."

—Justin Sun, Founder of TRON.

TRON has emerged as a dominant force for Tether (USDT) adoption, with 22.7 million holders on TRON compared to 4.2 million holders on Ethereum. This data underscores TRON's low-fee, scalable infrastructure, which has made it a preferred network for stablecoin usage. In just the last 24 hours, TRON’s daily transactions peaked at 6.94 million, further highlighting the platform’s scalability and its massive user activity.

Along with this announcement, Nansen is launching the TRON Macro Dashboard, providing investors and developers with an unprecedented view of the TRON ecosystem. This powerful tool will offer real-time, actionable insights that cut through the noise, helping users pinpoint high-value opportunities faster than ever before.

This dashboard will offer key insights into the ecosystem's activity and performance, including features like Token God Mode (TGM), Wallet Profiler, Hot Contracts, Wallet Profiler for Tokens (WP4T), Wallet Pair Profiler, Token Overlap, Token Screener and Smart Alerts.

About TRON

TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.

Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of November 2024, it has over 270 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 8 billion total transactions, and over $16 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN.

In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government’s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (“DMC”), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica’s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.
