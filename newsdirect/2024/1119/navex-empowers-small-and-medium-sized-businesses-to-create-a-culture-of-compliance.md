# NAVEX Empowers Small and Medium-Sized Businesses to Create a Culture of Compliance

NAVEX, the global leader in integrated risk and compliance management software, now makes it even easier for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to start and scale their governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) programs. With a long history of serving over 6,000 SMBs worldwide, the company understands the unique challenges these businesses face. As regulatory scrutiny intensifies and partnerships with larger enterprises expand, SMBs must adhere to complex compliance standards while positioning themselves for future growth, such as mergers and acquisitions.

“Global regulations, like the EU Whistleblower Protection Directive, can be daunting for smaller businesses,” explains NAVEX Chief Product Officer, A.G. Lambert. “NAVEX solutions such as WhistleB offer essentials like report intake, streamlined reporting, and case resolution while giving SMBs easy to use, effective, and fully compliant options.”

They often take a reactive approach to risk and compliance topics due to their perceived complexity and lack of full-time ownership. Indeed, according to NAVEX research, 42% of risk and compliance professionals at small and medium-sized businesses have other non-compliance responsibilities. Yet, overlooking compliance can carry a heavy cost, from fines and reputational damage to lost business and revenue.

Driving speak up compliance with NAVEX

To comply with EU whistleblowing regulations, all EU businesses with 50 employees or more must provide a confidential speak-up channel. Businesses can stay compliant with these policies using NAVEX WhistleB, a smart and simple solution that ensures all whistleblower reports are managed in sync with legal obligations. It provides peace of mind and focuses on EU regulatory compliance, SOC 2 Type II (all data processed by NAVEX WhistleB is stored in the EU), and efficient case management. Key features of NAVEX WhistleB include:

* Fast, secure report intake on incidents, compliance issues or potential risks.
* Clear, compliant incident management processes designed for speed and simplicity.
* Assured confidentiality and security to build trust in the speak-up program.
