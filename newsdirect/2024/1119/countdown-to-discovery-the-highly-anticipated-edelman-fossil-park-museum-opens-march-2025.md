# COUNTDOWN TO DISCOVERY: THE HIGHLY-ANTICIPATED EDELMAN FOSSIL PARK & MUSEUM OPENS MARCH 2025

Get ready for an unforgettable journey through time! The highly anticipated Edelman Fossil Park & Museum of Rowan University (EFM) will open its doors in March 2025, welcoming guests to an immersive exploration of dinosaurs and other prehistoric species. Located at 66 Million Mosasaur Way, the world-class museum will bring the age of dinosaurs roaring back to life with jaw-dropping exhibits, live animal encounters and life-sized depictions of epic creatures that roamed the mid-Atlantic seaboard 66 million years ago.

Just minutes from Philadelphia, Edelman Fossil Park & Museum has created a dinosaur lovers’ haven that invites guests to dive deep into Earth’s history. The museum will provide a portal into the fascinating lost world of dinosaurs, offering an extraordinary opportunity to dig for real fossils at the only place in the world where you can see a preserved fossil ecosystem from the exact moment of the asteroid impact that marked the end of the dinosaurs.

The museum features immersive galleries that bring the age of the dinosaurs to life with stunning, state-of-the-art reconstructions of giant species and their environments. Visitors can explore the hands-on Discovery Forest, marvel at live animals in Critter Cove, and engage with interactive exhibits, including an indoor fossil hunt powered by RFID technology. EFM also offers a thrilling free-roaming VR experience, a museum store, café, theater, scenic nature trails, and a paleontology-themed playground. Most importantly, the museum equips visitors with the knowledge and tools to take action—helping to create a greener, more sustainable future for our planet.

"The opening of Edelman Fossil Park & Museum marks a momentous occasion for our region and for visitors from around the world. This is not just a museum—it’s a gateway to a breathtaking chapter of Earth's history. Here, we open a window onto the profound and pivotal events of the fifth mass extinction, during which the dinosaurs and 75% of species perished, shaping the modern world as we know it,” said Dr. Kenneth Lacovara, founding executive director of the Edelman Fossil Park & Museum. “The fossils unearthed here tell the epic story of life’s fragility and resilience, weaving a cautionary tale that frames our present challenges and provides a roadmap towards a more sustainable tomorrow.”

Situated in southern New Jersey, a region globally recognized for its rich paleontological significance, EFM is poised to become a premier destination for interactive adventures and scientific discovery. In the depths of the quarry, more than 40 feet below the Fossil Park, over 100,000 fossils from more than 100 species, including mosasaurs, marine crocodiles, sea turtles, and sharks, have been unearthed, underscoring the site's significance.

Edelman Fossil Park & Museum was made possible by a generous donation from Rowan University alumni Jean & Ric Edelman. In addition to its commitment to education and impact, EFM is designed with sustainability at its core, featuring geothermal and electric systems that significantly reduce its carbon footprint. EFM aims to inspire positive change, transforming generations through scientific wonder and prioritizing the future of our planet.

The design team for EFM is a collaboration between Ennead Architects (Design Architect) together with KSS Architects (Executive Architect) and G&A (Museum Planning & Experience Design), along with landscape designers SEED Design/Yaki Miodovnik.
