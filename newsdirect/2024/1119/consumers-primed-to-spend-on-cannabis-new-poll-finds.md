# Consumers Primed to Spend on Cannabis, New Poll Finds

A majority of frequent cannabis consumers say their spending on cannabis has gone up during the past year, and a plurality say they expect it to continue to rise over the next year, according to a new consumer poll released today by NuggMD.

The poll shows 61% of respondents report spending “more” or “much more” on cannabis over the past year. Forty-five percent said they expect their spending on cannabis products to continue to rise over the next year, while just 25% signaled an intention to reduce their spending. The poll was first reported by Marijuana Moment.

“While our poll is a far cry from cash on hand for cannabis retailers and cultivators, it shows that demand is strong and is likely to become stronger in the near term,” said Andrew Graham, head of communications at NuggMD. “This data says that the demand side of the market is durable and highly resilient. Cannabis might be among the most recession-proof consumer products, because most cannabis use is rooted in wellness, not indulgence.”

Methodology

The two polls were conducted from Oct. 10 to Oct. 13 and Oct. 17 to Oct. 20 and have a margin of error of 5.9% and 4.8%, respectively.

NuggMD regularly conducts polls and market research on cannabis using a sample of nearly 1.2m frequent cannabis consumers who live in state-legal markets. The company’s polling capabilities are derived from first-party data it has collected and used since launching in 2015.
