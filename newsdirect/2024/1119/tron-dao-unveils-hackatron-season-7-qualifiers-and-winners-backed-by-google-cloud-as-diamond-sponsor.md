Geneva, Switzerland, November 19, 2024 – TRON DAO, in collaboration with co-hosts HTX DAO, BTTC, and JustLend DAO, proudly announced the qualifiers and winners of HackaTRON Season 7, a dynamic hackathon that united global innovators and showcased exceptional talent within the TRON ecosystem. TRON was honored to have Google Cloud as a Diamond Sponsor of HackaTRON S7. Google Cloud delivers an optimized, fully integrated AI stack, complete with planet-scale infrastructure, customer-built chips, and a powerful development platform, designed to accelerate transformative solutions.

About TRON DAO

TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.

Founded in September 2017 by Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services, boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of November 2024, it has over 271 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 8.9 billion total transactions, and over $18 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN.

In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government’s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (“DMC”), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica’s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens – TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.
