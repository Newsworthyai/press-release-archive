# New AI-Powered Mobile App Delivers Early Prediction of Heart Attack or Stroke

Before Health Intelligence, Ltd. today emerged from stealth and announced a new mHealth app called Antshrike™ that uses AI to transform wearable device data into highly precise and specific predictive cardiovascular health warnings.

As an iOS app, Antshrike uses proprietary AI algorithms to identify early warning signs of critical cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks or strokes, with high predictive accuracy for individuals at risk. The app processes biometric time-series data collected by commercially available Apple smart phones and smart watches, calculates individual risk of critical events in real time and predicts when and how changes in a patient’s health states may occur. By notifying patients of imminent danger in advance, Antshrike enables timely intervention by healthcare providers, paving the way for personalized medical intervention and treatment and improved medical outcomes.

“In South America, the Antshrike bird warns primates of upcoming dangers,” said Before Health Intelligence CEO & co-founder Ekaterina Mitricheva, MD, PhD. “We developed our new digital health app by the same name to warn those at risk of major ischemic cardiovascular events before they take place. With cardiovascular disease as the number one cause of death worldwide, there is an urgent need to predict and prevent heart attacks and strokes.”

The Antshrike mHealth app:

* Passively monitors health status without interrupting daily routines, social interactions and work habits
* Predicts the danger and timing of cardiovascular events with more than 85% accuracy in a personalized manner
* Uses proven science based on decades of research, more than 130 billion data points analyzed by Before Health Intelligence’s scientists, as well as open source CDC data from tens of thousands of individuals
* Assures HIPAA-compliant patient privacy by preprocessing individual patient data (not patient records) on a patient’s phone with anonymized preprocessed values that can never be traced back to any specific person
* Requires no manual input of data or reliance on expensive hospital equipment and procedures
* Assists healthcare providers in saving more lives since timely predictive interventions are known to reduce the probability of lasting effects or fatality

Antshrike uses two layers of AI, static and dynamic, to calculate an individual’s risk of critical events in real-time. The static layer processes data entered by an individual to determine an initial risk score, and the machine learning algorithm is trained on over 500,000 CDC datapoints of approximately 23,000 individuals. The dynamic layer collects and analyzes biometric time-series from smart watches in real-time, uses the proprietary AI algorithm to identify early warning signs of critical state transitions, and then delivers a personalized, time-sensitive risk score for an upcoming major ischemic cardiovascular event.

The freemium app is expected to be available in the U.S. in 2025. To become a partner or learn more about the product, visit https://www.before-intelligence.com/contact.
