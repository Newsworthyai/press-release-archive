Digital infrared thermal imaging (DITI) is a non-invasive, radiation-free screening tool to detect early signs of inflammation and abnormal blood flow patterns, which may be precursors to various health conditions. By identifying these indicators early, patients can proactively address potential issues before they develop into more serious conditions.

Phil Hagerman, Forum Health CEO: “With 1 in 8 women diagnosed with breast cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases on the rise, early detection is paramount. This acquisition underscores our commitment to advancing personalized, integrative healthcare and providing the latest, top-of-the-line technology to help our patients achieve optimal health.”

DITI is the only screening tool capable of detecting inflammation and associated heat patterns unlike X-rays, mammograms, MRIs and ultrasound tests. Some of the many health conditions DITI can screen for are:

* Breast cancer
* Early indications of asymptomatic and systemic inflammatory and degenerative processes
* Systemic, artery, dental, and sinus inflammation
* Unexplained and referred pain, including arthritis and nerve damage
* Fibromyalgia and digestive disorders
* Overactive and underactive thyroid conditions

Dr. Melissa Miskell, Hormones by Design founder: "We’re thrilled to welcome DITI Imaging into the Hormones by Design family. It allows us to expand our preventative healthcare offerings, better monitor the effects of hormone therapy, more comprehensively treat patients with thyroid conditions, and help people maintain optimal health as they age.”

Patients will have access to advanced screening services, including breast, full-body, and region-specific imaging, in addition to personalized BHRT options. Schedule an appointment or find a Hormones by Design location near you.
