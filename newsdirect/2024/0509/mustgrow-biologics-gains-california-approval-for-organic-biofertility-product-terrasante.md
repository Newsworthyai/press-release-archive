--News Direct--

MustGrow Biologics Chief Operating Officer Colin Bletsky joined Steve Darling from Proactive to share regulatory achievements for the company. MustGrow has received approval from the California Department of Food and Agriculture for its mustard plant-based TerraSante™, an organic biofertility product. Additionally, TerraSante™ has been granted organic certification specific to California requirements, supplementing its existing Organic OMRI Listed® certifications in Oregon and Washington State.

Bletsky announced that with these approvals, TerraSante™ sales can now begin in California. These developments are crucial to MustGrow's strategy for commercializing its soil amendment and biofertility technologies in partnership with BioAg Product Strategies. The company, which already holds certifications in Oregon and Washington, plans to pursue further state-level registrations across the U.S.

TerraSante™ is part of MustGrow's broader suite of solutions, which includes biocontrol programs targeting preplant soil fumigation, postharvest food preservation, and bioherbicides. These initiatives are advancing in collaboration with global partners such as Bayer, Sumitomo Corporation, Janssen PMP, and NexusBioAg, underlining MustGrow's commitment to sustainable agricultural practices worldwide.
