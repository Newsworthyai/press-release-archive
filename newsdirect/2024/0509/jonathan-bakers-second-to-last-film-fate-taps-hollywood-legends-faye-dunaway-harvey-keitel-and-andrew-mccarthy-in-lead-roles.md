# JONATHAN BAKER’S SECOND TO LAST FILM ‘FATE’ TAPS HOLLYWOOD LEGENDS FAYE
DUNAWAY, HARVEY KEITEL, AND ANDREW MCCARTHY IN LEAD ROLES

--News Direct--

Baker Entertainment Group, a film development and production

company rooted in the tradition of classic Hollywood romance by visionary filmmaker Jonathan Baker,

announced today its new film titled “Fate”. Academy Award-winning actor Faye Dunaway (“Bonnie &

Clyde”, “Chinatown,” “Network”), Academy Award-nominee Harvey Keitel (“Bugsy”, "Reservoir Dogs",

“Taxi Driver”), and Actor, Director, Writer, Andrew McCarthy (“The Blacklist,” “Orange is the New Black”

and the upcoming documentary “Brats” ) will lead an ensemble cast when shooting begins this month in

Vancouver.

This marks Jonathan Baker’s next directorial feature in what he calls an epic love story for our time. Baker

has always been captivated by smart storytelling and larger-than-life figures, drawing inspiration from

greats like Ernest Hemingway to guide his own sensibilities as a producer, writer, and director. Jonathan

drew inspiration for a pivotal character, the fictional ‘Vista’ hotel, from the iconic Los Angeles theater that

director Quenten Tarantino refurbished in 2022.

As Director Jonathan Baker reflects on the film’s supernatural love story, he says “There is an excellent

chance it will stand as one of the most memorable love stories of our time.” He teases one of the greatest

lines, “It takes a minute to find a special person, an hour to appreciate them, a day to love them and an

entire lifetime to forget them.” With this mantra guiding their creative journey, the team behind “Fate” is

“hoping to craft an epic love story destined to leave an indelible mark on audiences around the world.

Faye Dunaway is set to lead the cast in “Fate” before jetting off to celebrate her career with the world

premiere of her HBO Documentary film FAYE at Cannes. In the documentary, she candidly discusses the

triumphs, from the Oscars to her career in the Golden Age of Hollywood, and the challenges of her

illustrious career. Her relationship with Jonathan on the film “Inconceivable” paved the way for her pivotal

part in “Fate”, sure to be one of her greatest roles.

Harvey Keitel is known as one of the greatest actors of his generation, born out of the likes of Scorcese

and Tarantino. He is gracing the “Fate” team with a surprising character turn that could very well change

the world’s perception of an already legendary actor.

Andrew McCarthy in “Less than Zero” inspired Jonathan Baker to create a fascinating portrait of an artist

at the height of his powers. “Kristoff is a reflection on Pablo Picasso’s penchant for sucking life out of

muses,” explains Jonathan. As a lifelong fan of 80’s cinema, Jonathan knew McCarthy was essential to

the role after reading his book, ‘Brat: An '80s Story’.

Jonathan Baker is producing “Fate” after developing it for five years, bringing a singular ambition and

passion to creating this ‘Unforgettable’ feature film. Highland FIlm Group is selling international rights to

the film at Cannes.
