# Castile Resources: Advancing Australia's Polymetallic Mining Frontier

--News Direct--

Castile Resources Managing Director Mark Hepburn joined Steve Darling from Proactive to share about the company that is distinguished by its polymetallic deposit located in the Northern Territory of Australia.

The company has recently completed its pre-feasibility study, signalling a move towards downstream production, which includes the production of pure copper, cobalt (99% purity), gold, indium, and a 96.5% magnetite product.

These products are crucial for the decarbonisation industry, marking a significant differentiator for Castile in producing end-user materials. The Rover One project is highlighted as a highly profitable operation with an NPV of 450 million Australian dollars and an IRR of approximately 46%. This small to medium-sized project is expected to generate between 225 to 250 million dollars of revenue annually, culminating in about 2 billion dollars over its eight-year lifespan.

The next steps for the company involve securing financing and a project partner to assist with funding. Hepburn emphasizes the importance of a 'Big Brother' partner, especially one that requires Castile's copper and cobalt, to ensure the project's success.

Additionally, Castile is exploring other deposits near Rover One and has acquired exploration ground in Western Australia, indicating potential for lithium, niobium, and rare earth elements. Hepburn's tour, including his visit to the OTC Studios in New York City, underscores the significance of North American investors and mining companies in Castile's strategy, especially given the critical status of copper and cobalt in the USA.
