Traditional wealth management companies might need to rethink their strategy or risk losing younger clients with new regulations set to reveal high banking fees.

According to a new investment satisfaction survey by J.D. Power, 25% of Gen Z and 22% of Millennials would consider switching wealth management firms in the next year, citing high transaction costs as their main concern.1

The upcoming fee transparency regulations, known as total cost reporting, are set to take effect in 2026 and would require more clarity and communication in explaining the costs and fees associated with investments.

This sentiment is echoed in findings from a Broadridge/Roubini ThoughtLab survey, which illustrates that Millennials possess a deep understanding of financial concepts critical to investment success. They are acutely aware of how fees can eat into returns, prefer index funds for their cost-effectiveness, and understand the use of derivatives for risk mitigation.

These evolving preferences indicate a seismic shift in how younger generations approach investing, prioritizing transparency, low fees, and the ethical dimensions of their investment choices.

This shift provides a fertile ground for innovative financial technology companies like Mogo Inc. (NASDAQ:MOGO) (TSX:MOGO), which is stepping in to meet these new consumer demands with modern, user-friendly solutions.
