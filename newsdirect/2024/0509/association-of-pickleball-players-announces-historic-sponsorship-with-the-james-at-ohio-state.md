“I am thrilled to stand alongside The James to elevate and celebrate women in pickleball and support Breast Cancer Awareness Month,” said Shannon Dan, APP EVP of global partnerships. “The APP Women’s Open presented by The James will be part tournament, part festival and 100% fun for women of all ages and skill levels. It’s an event designed by and for women: a place to compete, celebrate and connect.”
