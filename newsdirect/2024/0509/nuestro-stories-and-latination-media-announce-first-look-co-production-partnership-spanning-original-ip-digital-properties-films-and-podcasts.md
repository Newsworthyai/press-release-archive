Nuestro Stories and LatiNation Media, two trailblazing Latino-owned media companies, have joined forces in an unprecedented first-look co-production and content distribution partnership. The alliance spans digital platforms, films, series, and audio content, representing a significant leap forward in elevating Hispanic voices and stories within the media landscape. The collaboration was unveiled during the prestigious 2024 IAB NewFronts, marking a pivotal moment in Hispanic media evolution.

“This collaboration is the result of our profound mutual admiration for each other’s creative endeavors and and our shared belief that together, we can go farther, faster, and stronger,” said Angela Sustaita-Ruiz, Chairwoman of Brilla Media Ventures, the holding company of Nuestro Stories. “The fact that two iconic storytelling brands are uniting for some of their biggest ideas bodes well for creators and filmmakers, as well as for brands who encourage but rarely see Latino-owned companies like us collaborating like this.”

The inaugural project for the partnership is the highly anticipated Entre2Mundos, an anime series rooted in Mesoamerican culture that is tailored to US Hispanic audiences. The profound affinity for Anime within Hispanic culture has been on the rise for decades. Today, as Gen Z consumers openly express their love and fandom for Anime, the genre is experiencing a surge in attention, captivating the interest of younger Hispanic generations.

“LatiNation Media’s core ideology involves sharing impactful content with our audience that reflects their diverse and expansive lives. We are thrilled to partner with Nuestro Stories and bring Entre2Mundos to life – the first Anime series of its kind for Latino audiences on both national broadcast and streaming. This is an exciting initial step toward more fan-first programming for us,” said Bruno Ulloa, President of LatiNation Media.

As Nuestro Stories and LatiNation Media embark on this shared journey of innovation and inclusivity, they reaffirm their commitment to championing diverse narratives and fostering authentic representation in media and entertainment.
