# Beyond Oil Celebrates New Milestone: Secures Major International Food Chain as Customer

--News Direct--

Beyond Oil Vice President Robert Kiesman joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce the successful integration of their innovative oil filtration product into one of the world's largest food chains, now officially a client. This comes after Beyond Oil completed joint pilot programs with franchisees of a major international food service parent company in Israel.

Kiesman detailed how, after extensive multi-month trials and close collaboration with the corporate team of this renowned global fast-food chain, Beyond Oil has proven the effectiveness and benefits of their product. The trials have led to a comprehensive rollout across all the chain's outlets in Israel, marking a new operational standard for the franchise group.

The innovative product developed by Beyond Oil includes a formula of food additives that, when used in a simple filtration process, slow down oil deterioration and allow for repeated use without loss of quality. The adoption of this technology has not only improved the quality of frying oil and food but also offered significant health benefits, contributing to environmental sustainability, employee well-being, enhanced guest experience, operational efficiency, and reductions in both food and labor costs.

With this successful implementation, Beyond Oil is now strategically positioned to expand its technology across the global franchise network. Discussions are currently ongoing with multiple franchisees worldwide to integrate Beyond Oilâ€™s technology into their operations.
