# Genflow Biosciences advances three major programs in fight against ageing diseases

--News Direct--

Genflow Biosciences PLC CE Dr Eric Leire tells Proactive's Stephen Gunnion the company had a successful year in 2023, allowing it to expand its research and development pipeline.

Leire highlighted three main programs during an interview. The first focuses on MASH (Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis), soon progressing to clinical trials, indicating a strong move towards addressing liver diseases. The second program deals with Werner Syndrome, a progeria-related condition, where Genflow is innovating with synthetic organoids to mimic human organ function for better clinical trial predictions. The third program targets sarcopenia in collaboration with Revatis SA, aiming to combat muscle loss associated with ageing.

The company has also engaged with regulatory agencies in Europe and the US, receiving positive feedback on its approach, particularly with its MASH program. It is awaiting further feedback from the FDA to decide the trial's location.

In addition to a recent Â£715,000 fundraise, Genflow's financial strategy relies heavily on grants, with recent significant funding from the Wallonia Region in Belgium, which Leire believes positions it well to continue its work without heavy reliance on venture capital.
