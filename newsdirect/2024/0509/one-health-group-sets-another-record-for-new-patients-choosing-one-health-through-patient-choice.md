# One Health Group sets another record for new patients choosing One Health through Patient Choice

--News Direct--

One Health Group PLC (AQSE:OHGR) CEO Adam Binns joined Proactive's Stephen Gunnion with details of a full-year trading update that showed revenue of more than £23 million for the year to 31 March 2024, and net year-end cash of £4.7 million, which will fund investment in future growth and underpin its progressive dividend policy.

Binns explained that One Health Group operates as an independent provider of NHS services in the UK, specifically targeting various local economies with subcontracted health services. The company, established 22 years ago, focuses on providing non-surgical treatments and surgical interventions through subcontracted consultants and facilities.

He emphasised patient choice, enabling patients to select their healthcare provider through GP referrals or directly from NHS waiting lists. One Health Group also boasts a rapid treatment timeline of 6 to 8 weeks compared to traditional NHS routes.

Strategically, One Health Group is expanding its geographical footprint across the UK, moving into regions like Manchester and Coventry, with plans to increase their owned capacity for more efficient service delivery. Additionally, it secured two new five-year contracts with the NHS, reflecting confidence in its service quality and operational stability.

Overall, One Health Group's model of integrating NHS and subcontracted services aims to alleviate pressure on NHS resources while maintaining high standards of patient care and operational efficiency.
