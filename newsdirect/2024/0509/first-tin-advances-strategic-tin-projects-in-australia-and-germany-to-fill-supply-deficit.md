# First Tin advances strategic tin projects in Australia and Germany to fill supply deficit

--News Direct--

First Tin PLC CEO Bill Scotting joins Proactive's Stephen Gunnion with details of the two tin mining projects the company is developing in Australia and Germany.

Scotting said the Taronga project, near Brisbane, will operate as an open pit mine and is expected to produce approximately 3,500 tonnes of tin concentrate annually. The German project, Tellerh√§user is being developed as an underground mine and will target multiple metals, including tin, indium, copper, and zinc. Both projects are situated in historic tin mining districts, with the German site dating back centuries.

Scotting said technological advancements in mining and processing have enabled more efficient extraction and processing of tin. Market dynamics, such as increased tin pricing, have also improved the economic viability of these projects. Additionally, he noted that First Tin implements high environmental standards in its operations, including the use of solar power in Australia and adherence to strict environmental regulations in both countries.

Scotting highlighted the growing global demand for tin, driven by its critical role in electronic manufacturing and the energy transition, including solar energy and electric vehicles. He noted a structural change in the market, with increasing tin usage in various high-tech applications.

He also pointed out the strategic advantage of their mines' locations in OECD countries, which ensures a more stable and secure supply chain compared to tin sources in emerging economies.
