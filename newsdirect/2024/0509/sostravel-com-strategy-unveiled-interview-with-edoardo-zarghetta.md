# Sostravel.com strategy unveiled: interview with Edoardo Zarghetta

--News Direct--

SosTravel.com (OTCQB:SOSAF, EURONEXT:SOS) investor relations head Edoardo Zarghetta outlines the company's operations and strategic directions in an interview with Proactive's Stephen Gunnion.

Sostravel.com operates primarily as a digital travel technology company with two business units. One focuses on packaging holidays, primarily in destinations such as Sardinia, southern Italy, Kenya, Turkey, Egypt, and Cuba, managing hotels and resorts to create custom holiday packages. The second unit provides technology services, including a Lost Luggage Concierge and Dr Travel for telehealth needs, enhancing travellers' experiences by addressing common issues like lost luggage and health care in foreign locales.

The company benefits from a commercial relationship with shareholder TraWell Co SpA (OTCQX:TRWAF), which markets Sostravel.com's services at airports, enhancing visibility and customer acquisition. This relationship allows the implementation of unique marketing strategies focused on leveraging travel needs to introduce value-added services, distinguishing Sostravel.com from competitors by creating a symbiotic ecosystem between holiday offers and service provision.

The company reported a 29.6% increase in gross booking value as of March and projects significant growth in revenues and EBITDA for 2024, with updates expected in August to confirm these forecasts.
