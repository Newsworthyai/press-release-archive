AIGOLD: Pioneering Gold Integration in Cryptocurrency with Enhanced Security and Market Stability

AIGOLD is aiming to lead the integration of gold into the cryptocurrency sector, enhancing security and stability for those engaged in trading. The platform’s design includes dedicating a portion of the proceeds from the presale of AIG (AIGOLD) tokens to acquire PAXG tokens. PAXG tokens are backed by physical gold, each representing one fine troy ounce stored in LBMA-certified vaults in London. At launch, the liquidity pool, underpinned by over one million dollars in PAXG, will be securely locked and aligned with gold price movement

The initial presale price for AIGOLD is set at $0.0035 per token and the project underwent comprehensive audits from Cyberscope and is currently being audited by CertiK, underscore AIGOLD’s commitment to security and transparency. As the market trends towards gold-backed assets, AIGOLD is looking to offer a unique platform that not only secures value but also rewards participants with gold, enhancing their participation in the evolving digital economy.

AIGOLD: Leading Sustainable Digital Finance with Strategic Tokenomics

AIGOLD team’s innovative tokenomics structure is crafted to foster growth and establish a solid foundation for its next developmental phase. This structure, along with a strategic tax model, is aimed at enhancing the benefits for participants in the ecosystem. By reinvesting 2% of every transaction back into the liquidity pool, AIGOLD looks to ensure a dynamic and well-supported trading environment. Additionally, a designated marketing allocation aims at keeping AIGOLD prominent in the marketplace, driving ongoing visibility and engagement. The team sees the self-sustaining approach as marking a notable evolution in the cryptocurrency arena, positioning AIGOLD as a leader in sustainable digital finance practices.

AIGOLD: Empowering Future Financial Landscapes with Innovative Rewards and Stability

AIGOLD’s ecosystem offers multiple compensation methods to its participants, including rewards in gold for every transaction. Holders of AIG tokens will potentially benefit from a 5% share of gold with each buy and sell action, thanks to AIG’s built-in reward mechanism. This reward is issued in digital gold, which can also be claimed physically. AIGOLD not only provides rewards in gold but also serves as a strategic hedge against inflation and de-dollarization. By integrating artificial intelligence with gold, AIGOLD is not merely a tool for potential profit but a forward-looking platform designed to empower participants for future financial landscapes.

These exclusive mining permits offer additional benefits to AIG NFT holders, including receiving an annual share of 25% of the profits from gold recovered in AIG’s mining operations. This innovative approach positions AIG NFT holders to benefit from the burgeoning digital economy.

AIGOLDs team marks a transformative point in the development of digital currencies by integrating artificial intelligence with genuine gold mining. This initiative is led by new technology, including an AI-integrated exploration recovery vessel (ERV) equipped with state-of-the-art tools and LIDAR systems. These advancements facilitate the extraction of gold from the seabed in the Bering Sea, where estimates suggest there are over 500 million ounces of gold. With the rising value of gold, strategic positioning is crucial. AIGOLD’s founder and CEO, Forest, from Cornell University, stated, “At AIGOLD, we are forging a unique combination of advanced artificial intelligence, forefront technology, and the reliability of gold-backed assets.” For more details about AIGOLD, including its tokenomics, token metrics, and gold paper, users can visit aigold.io.
