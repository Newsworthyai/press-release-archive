With investors searching for the next crypto star, Popcat, Cutoshi and Dai are stepping up to the plate. But among them, Cutoshi stands out, bringing DeFi utility to the meme coin game and giving investors more than just hype.

Popcat Prints Yet Another ATHPopcat has been causing quite a stir, recently reaching a new ATH price of $2 this month.

With a market cap now over $1.4 billion, POPCAT’s rise has been nothing short of electric. Popcat’s weekly price has held between $1.35 and $1.79 and if it can keep its position above key EMAs, the bullish momentum could just keep going. For fans and traders alike, POPCAT’s position at these levels means it’s still in the game, potentially setting up for another leg up.

Sky’s Rebrand And Dai’s New LookIn a major DeFi revamp, Maker Protocol has rebranded as Sky, aiming to make decentralized finance accessible and easy to navigate for everyone. And with this rebrand, the iconic Dai stablecoin has morphed into USDS, stepping up to take on the big players like Tether.

Even Maker’s MKR token has a new identity: it’s now known as Sky (SKY). While Dai has held steady with a strong market cap above $5 billion, its price sits at $0.99, below its $1.22 all-time high. But USDS has gained some serious momentum, racking up $490 million in market cap in just five days. With this fresh rebrand, Sky’s USDS shows it’s here to win, taking its place among DeFi heavyweights.

Cutoshi’s MemeFi Token Disrupts The Rallying Meme Coin MarketWhile we are all familiar with the likes of Popcat, Cutoshi is an entirely new take on what a meme coin can be. With presale hype building, Cutoshi is gathering steam fast and with good reason: it’s a project tackling some real issues in crypto trading, such as security, privacy and that smooth experience people crave across exchanges.

At the same time, Cutoshi also represents luck and prosperity through its mascot, the Chinese Lucky Cat, a timeless symbol of wealth in many homes, bringing it now to the world of blockchain.

Now in presale stage three, CUTO is priced at $0.0259 and with its CoinMarketCap listing, limited supply and the buzz building up, Cutoshi is going viral.
