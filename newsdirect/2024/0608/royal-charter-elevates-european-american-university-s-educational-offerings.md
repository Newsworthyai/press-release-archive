# Royal Charter Elevates European-American University's Educational Offerings

European-American University, an institution committed to excellence for more than 20 years, proudly upholds its Royal Charter, marking its recognition and credibility in the educational arena. This esteemed recognition, combined with the university's authorization under the statutes of the State of Florida to award religious degrees, as well as its registration as a private higher education provider in France (Ecole Superieure Euro-Americaine), places European-American University among the ranks of universities with a truly global footprint.

"Receiving a Royal Charter of Incorporation from the King of the Bunyoro-Kitara Kingdom and achieving international validation are significant milestones for European-American University," stated Professor John Kersey, Chancellor. "These recognitions not only honor our educational commitment but also reassure our students and partners of the quality and legitimacy of our programs. I'm very proud of the fact that we have a presence on three continents."

The Royal Charter is a testament to the university's adherence to high standards of educational excellence and its contribution to academic scholarship. In addition to the Royal Charter, European-American University holds a wide range of recognition and accreditation agreements with institutions worldwide. These partnerships and recognitions validate the university's programs, allowing graduates to leverage their degrees on a global scale and enhance their professional and academic opportunities.

The university offers a diverse array of degree programs at the associate's, bachelor's, master's, and PhD levels across various disciplines, including business, humanities, and the arts. Some programs are delivered through a flexible, distance learning format that allows students to balance their studies with personal and professional commitments. Some programs even allow students to get a degree entirely through their previous life experience without taking any additional classes or exams at all. These experience-based degrees are based on the Validation des Acquis de l'Experience (VAE) framework which was codified into French law in 2002.
