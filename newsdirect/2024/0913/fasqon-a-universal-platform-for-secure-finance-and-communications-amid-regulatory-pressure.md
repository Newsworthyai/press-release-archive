# Fasqon: A Universal Platform for Secure Finance and Communications Amid Regulatory Pressure

Fasqon introduces a revolutionary solution for modern users, combining financial services and messaging in one secure AI-driven environment. In response to increasing regulatory measures and the growing need for privacy, Fasqon offers a game-changing platform for banking transactions and communications.

Global Challenges: Regulations, High Fees, and Data Breaches

In 2024, the financial sector faces new challenges: increased regulatory scrutiny, more data breaches, and higher transaction fees. More than 60% of users experience difficulties when conducting crypto-fiat transactions, and traditional banks cannot provide sufficient security and privacy. These problems are forcing users to seek new solutions to manage their finances and communications.

Fasqon: A Complete Solution for Secure Transactions and Communication

Fasqon offers a unified platform that eliminates the need to use multiple apps for financial management and communication. Key features include:

– Messenger with financial services integration: The platform allows users to upload invoices, automatically recognize the details, and make payments directly through the messenger. This eliminates the need to copy details and minimizes errors, ensuring fast and secure transactions.

– Bank card with seed phrase and a limit of up to 200 euros: The card provides anonymity and security, allowing users to conduct small transactions without complicated procedures and with minimal fees. This solution is particularly relevant in the context of strict regulatory control and high fees.

– Automated operations through AI: By using AI for invoice processing and transaction management, the platform can reduce processing time by up to 70%, making it an ideal solution for small and medium businesses and individuals.

– Direct P2P messaging and transactions: Avoiding the use of servers and third parties for data exchange ensures privacy and security, which is critical in an era of increasing cyber-attacks and data breaches.

The Power of the Fasqon Community: Uniting Users for Global Change

One of Fasqon’s key strengths is its strong and vibrant user community, which actively supports and develops the platform. More than 15,000 Fasqon evangelists are united by the idea of security, privacy, and convenience in one application. The community actively participates in discussions about new features, offers ideas, and suggests improvements, making the platform not only user-friendly but also focused on real user needs.

Round B of Funding

With the current Series B funding, Fasqon aims to raise additional resources to expand its capabilities and scale into new markets. Its unique business model and innovative solutions have attracted the attention of strategic investors, including two major banks from Asia, which are interested in supporting the platform’s development.

Fasqon is not just offering a product – it is an invitation to participate in creating a new standard of security and convenience in the world of financial technology.

Joining the Fasqon community means becoming part of a global movement to protect user rights and ensure transparency in financial transactions.

Future Key Steps and Strategic Initiatives for 2025

– Licensing in key European jurisdictions: Obtaining licenses in Portugal and the Czech Republic to ensure compliance and user protection.

– Integration with new partners: Expanding cooperation with local market operators for rapid expansion within countries.

– 1,000,000 users within a year of launch: Confidently scaling the product in the European and Asian markets.
