The world can be a dangerous place whether you are out walking or living alone. Protecting yourself from attacks, emergencies or other calamities isn’t always that easy if there is no one around to help.

Unintentional falls in the home are a major concern, being the number one cause of injury and death among people 65 and older. Safety concerns exist for individuals of all ages as they navigate life. Some 40% of Americans polled by Gallup said they would be scared walking alone at night in their neighborhoods; a thirty-year high.

To address those concerns, companies are churning out remote monitoring devices, going after a market forecast to grow at a CAGR of 11.2% between now and 2028. But many are singularly focused, catering either to the aging population or to people who don’t feel safe in parking lots, getting in a ride-share or walking alone.

One company going against the grain by offering solutions to both groups is LogicMark Inc. (NASDAQ: LGMK). The maker of personal emergency response systems (PERS), health communications devices and IoT technologies has a suite of products designed to create a connected care platform that can help whether you are at home or out and about.

Monitoring At Home And On The Go The Freedom Alert Mini is a compact, on-the-go safety device that offers a comprehensive set of life-saving features. With 4G LTE connectivity, at the push of a button, users can call for help everywhere there is cell service. LogicMark aims to ensure reliable communication even in situations where the user can’t speak.

The company’s built-in patented fall detection technology detects falls and sudden movements, triggering an alert for help. Thanks to LogicMark’s geofencing technology, caregivers also receive alerts if their loved one moves beyond a virtual geographic boundary. GPS location service pinpoints exactly where a device is, sending help when the user is unable to speak or respond.

Freedom Alert Mini connects to a 24/7 U.S.-based monitoring service that promptly contacts first responders and loved ones or caregivers when necessary. Companion Apple iOS and Android apps enable pairing to detect falls, engaging in two-way communication during an emergency and caregiving monitoring.

Freedom Alert Plus is an in-home medical device that boasts several features. It includes patented fall detection, two-way communication during an emergency, and calls a 24/7 monitoring service. The device connects to in-home Wi-Fi, allowing users to reach emergency services at the press of a button or when a fall is detected. The Freedom Alert Plus companion app enables fall detection alerts, device pairing, two-way communication during an emergency, caregiver alerts, and more.

No Strings Monitoring LogicMark also has a suite of devices that aim to provide safety without monitoring fees. Guardian Alert Plus is a 4G LTE-connected device that, with a press of a button, connects directly with 911 to dispatch first responders. This on-the-go device has 4G LTE coverage, two-way voice communication, and a long battery life, the company says.

For in-home use, LogicMark has two devices. Freedom Alert allows users to connect with friends and family or 911 in an emergency. With the push of a button, the device can call up to four pre-programmed contacts and features 911 call forwarding. In emergencies, a family member on the line can press five to connect you directly with 911.

Guardian Alert 911 connects users to 911 with the push of a button. One button means that even during a confusing or frightening moment, the user can easily call for emergency services or notify a caregiver. The device also supports two-way voice communication.

Both devices use the customer’s landline to connect to emergency services. Guardian Alert 911 works within a 600-foot radius of the base unit. Freedom Alert and Guardian Alert 911 have long batteries that LogicMark says last three to six months based on battery saver settings.

There’s An App For ThatLogicMark’s work goes beyond just making devices. It has also developed multiple personal safety apps to form a connected care platform. Their standalone app, Aster, turns mobile phones into personal safety devices. Aster is designed for people who are worried about their safety, whether in parking lots, on a date, walking down the street or in a rideshare.

Users have four ways to get help: a Bluetooth button, a home screen slider for quick access to emergency services, a ‘Hold Until Safe’ button to arm the app, and the ‘Follow-Me’ feature to schedule alerts and check-ins. Once activated, the app requires you to enter a PIN to cancel if the threat becomes less urgent. Emergency services are alerted and dispatched to the phone’s GPS location. Users can add trusted followers for check-ins and schedule events that alert followers if they don’t check in on time. The app will call emergency services if you don’t check in before the timer is canceled.

Aster’s Bluetooth button is a small device that clips to a purse, keychain or backpack strap that users can push to call for help without opening their phone. The button calls for help with three presses, a 24/7 monitoring service will answer and stay on the phone until users feel safe. The compact button has a five-month battery life.

Whether you are at home or out and about, with LogicMark’s suite of medical alert devices and the Aster App, you can feel safe and secure no matter what stage of life you are in. From devices that have live monitoring, GPS location pinpointing and fall detection to ones that can contact your friends and family when you can’t, the company says it is striving to make the world safe. It is aiming to appeal to a growing base of older adults as well as innovating to attract younger generations. A multi-pronged approach to protecting a broad spectrum differentiates LogicMark in the industry, the company says, and is behind the company’s growth, in addition to business-to-business and business-to-government sales channels.
