# Green Lantern Solar Welcomes New Director of Development to Lead Expansion of Community Solar Projects

Green Lantern Solar, an innovative and trusted renewable energy developer, has added Brendan Boland as a Director of Development.

Boland has been actively involved in the origination and development of solar projects in New York and Illinois for nearly five years. At Green Lantern Solar, he will spearhead the development of community and small-scale utility solar, C&I solar and battery storage projects in New York, the Midwest and other emerging markets.

“It’s been great getting Brendan on board and up to speed,” said David Carpenter, Vice President of Development for Green Lantern Solar. “He brings a wealth of experience in New York and has proved to be a quick study, already adding value to our process. His highly analytical approach will undoubtedly enhance our development efforts, and his consistently upbeat attitude is a welcome presence as we navigate the ever-changing landscape of today’s solar industry.”

Boland’s career in renewables began during an internship at the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). This experience drove his interest in clean energy and laid the foundation for his career in solar development.

“I’m thrilled to join Green Lantern Solar and contribute to the company’s continued growth in community solar,” said Boland. “There’s a tremendous opportunity to expand access to clean energy in emerging markets, and I look forward to leveraging my experience and collaborating with this talented team to bring impactful projects to life.”

Boland is a Hudson Valley native with a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry from the University at Albany.

Since 2011 Green Lantern Solar has advanced the development, construction and operation of more than 125 community solar projects and commercial solar solutions for municipal, education, healthcare and government entities. Green Lantern Solar works with landowners to revitalize and re-develop low-value sites such as brownfields, landfills, quarries/pits/extraction sites and other challenging real estate.
