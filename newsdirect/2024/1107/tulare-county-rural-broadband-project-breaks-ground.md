# Tulare County Rural Broadband Project Breaks Ground

Today, Comcast hosted a groundbreaking ceremony in Pixley, CA, a rural community approximately 30 miles south of Visalia, to kick off its new rural broadband expansion project in Tulare County. The project will bring Comcast’s smart, fast, reliable, fiber-rich Xfinity broadband network to approximately 6,200 previously unserved locations in areas of Alpaugh, Dinuba, Earlimart, Kingsburg, Pixley, Sultana, Traver, Tulare, Visalia, and Tipton and is expected to be completed by early 2026.

The planned expansion adds to Comcast’s more than $4 billion in technology and infrastructure investments across California in the past three years. The expansion is made possible by a more than $26 million Federal Funding Account (FFA) grant from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and private funding by Comcast.

Additionally, Comcast announced a $25,000 contribution to the Tulare County Office of Education Foundation to help create greater digital equity and provide digital literacy resources that enable students, individuals, and families to access high speed Internet and more fully participate in the digital economy.

“What we value so much about Comcast is they take a big picture view of our community,” said Fernie Marroquin, Assistant Superintendent, Tulare County Office of Education. “So yes, deploying this kind of advanced networking technology is huge. But Comcast goes beyond that to ask ‘how else can we help?’ And with a financial contribution of this size and scale, that much needed help can go a long way toward supporting a variety of needs -- and our community greatly appreciates it.”

“We could not be happier or prouder that Tulare County is one of the first areas to receive a Federal Funding Account grant to bring high-speed broadband to our rural communities,” Pete Vander Poel, Tulare County Board of Supervisors. “This sizable investment in our technology infrastructure will drive economic development, support existing businesses, while attracting new ones, and enable enhanced educational opportunities and career growth for our residents. We are grateful to Comcast and the CPUC and look forward to working together to bring this important project to fruition.”

“Access to next-generation broadband is something that some communities may take for granted, but it’s a really big deal in this rural part of the state.” said Donnette Silva Carter, CEO of the Tulare Chamber of Commerce. “I can’t wait to see how this technology shapes our future, supports the region’s growth, and enables us to compete in ways that were never even possible before. I think this is going to be a game changer!”

Comcast’s commitment to new communities goes beyond the build—addressing digital opportunities in communities through Project UP, the company’s $1 billion dollar commitment to help tens of millions of people connect to the Internet and build futures of unlimited possibilities. Over the past three years, Comcast has invested more than $130.5 million in cash and in-kind donations into California nonprofits focused on helping people build digital skills, expanding WiFi connected Lift Zones, and funding connectivity and Internet adoption programs.

Comcast’s funding also supports ongoing efforts to build awareness about affordable connectivity services like Internet Essentials, which offers eligible households high-speed Internet for $9.95/month or Internet Essentials Plus for $29.95/month. Affordable computers are also available through Internet Essentials. Since its inception in 2011, the program has connected more than 2.2 million Californians.

Residential customers will be able to take advantage of Xfinity’s full suite of products, including Internet, video, mobile, voice and managed home solutions. For local businesses, Comcast Business will offer a suite of connectivity, communications, networking, cybersecurity, wireless, and managed solutions to help organizations of different sizes prepare for what’s next.

Comcast’s network and Internet experience are powering homes today and into the future.

* Ultimate Capacity: Xfinity customers connect more than 1 billion devices across the company’s network annually. With the next-generation Xfinity gateways, we deliver the most advanced WiFi technology carrying three times more bandwidth to power streaming, gaming, videoconferencing, and more, simultaneously.
* Fastest Internet: Nearly a third of Xfinity Internet customers subscribe to gigabit speed products. Recently Comcast connected the first customers in the world to a DOCSIS 4.0 connection, delivering symmetrical gig speeds over existing connections in customers’ homes with plans to continue to rollout these speeds across the country over the coming years.
* Unprecedented Coverage: The latest Xfinity Gateway provides a more reliable connection throughout the home. Customers can get wall-to-wall WiFi coverage with a powerful WiFi Boost Pod that extends coverage to hard-to-reach areas of the home.
* Most Reliable Connection: Comcast is scaling the nation’s largest and most reliable network that passes 62 million homes and businesses and counting. The company launched Storm-Ready WiFi, a new device that comes powered with cellular and battery backup to help keep customers connected even when the power goes out.
* Ultra-Low Latency: The Xfinity network and the latest Xfinity Gateway are a powerful combination that deliver ultra-low latency for those moments when response times matter most like video games, a fast-growing category with Xfinity households averaging more than one gaming console per home.
