# Lisk Joins Forces with Rainbow Wallet to Offer Native Integration

Lisk, a Layer 2 Ethereum blockchain dedicated to empowering web3 adoption in emerging markets, and Rainbow Wallet, the fun, simple, and secure way to explore web3, are pleased to announce a seamless integration of the Lisk network into Rainbow’s mobile apps and browser extension. This collaboration aims to provide users with enhanced functionalities and a superior experience in managing their digital assets.

Key Features of the Integration:

* Seamless User Experience: Lisk users can now easily manage their tokens, NFTs, and DeFi positions all in one intuitive platform. The integration simplifies asset management, allowing for effortless navigation through the Lisk ecosystem.
* Enhanced Functionality: Users will benefit from in-app swaps, cross-chain asset bridging, and NFT minting directly within the Rainbow wallet. This functionality enables a comprehensive and versatile interaction with the Lisk network.
* Rewards and Incentives: Lisk will be included in Rainbow’s Points and ETH Rewards programs, providing users with additional benefits for their platform activities.

The integration offers an unparalleled opportunity for web3 users and developers to explore and interact with Lisk-based tokens, NFTs, and DeFi positions through Rainbow’s user-friendly interface. Users can download the Rainbow wallet on iOS or Android, or as a browser extension, to begin utilizing Lisk’s features. Engaging with the Lisk ecosystem has never been easier or more rewarding.

“Easy-to-use wallets like Rainbow are driving the next wave of adoption,” said Dominic Schwenter, COO of Lisk. “We are moving away from the clunky UX that characterized the early days of crypto, adapting to user-friendly interfaces that resonate with today’s digital consumers.”

Rainbow was the first wallet to natively enable Optimism, paving the way for seamless integration with layer-2 solutions. At launch, Rainbow also introduced native support for Zora and Base, expanding its ecosystem to include these important platforms. The wallet has been at the forefront of community engagement, leading dedicated campaigns for OP rewards and Onchain Summer. With the introduction of ETH rewards on Optimism, all Rainbow users will now have an ETH balance on the Superchain by default, further enhancing the wallet's utility and user experience.

“We are excited to partner with infrastructure projects like Lisk that empower web3 adoption in emerging markets,” said Tom Dean, Marketing Lead at Rainbow. “We are committed to the Superchain vision, where Lisk is a pioneer member of, and believe that the Ethereum ecosystem is the ideal place for innovation and growth.”

This partnership strengthens Lisk's network accessibility and broadens its appeal to existing and new users alike.
