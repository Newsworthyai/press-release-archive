# Rotunda Capital Partners Named for Fifth Consecutive Year in Inc.'s 2024 List of Founder-Friendly Investors

Rotunda Capital Partners (“Rotunda”), an operationally driven private equity firm focused on the lower middle market, is proud to announce its continued recognition on Inc.’s esteemed Founder-Friendly Investors list. This accolade, awarded to 269 select private equity, venture capital, and debt firms, celebrates Rotunda’s dedication to fostering genuine partnerships with founder-led businesses, helping them achieve their vision through strategic growth and transformation.

Rotunda collaborates closely with family- and founder-owned companies that are looking to scale or reposition their business for long-term success. Every investment begins with a shared commitment to cultural alignment and mutual goals, ensuring each partnership is built on trust. Together with its portfolio companies, Rotunda focuses on driving sustainable growth by leveraging data insights, operational expertise, and a tailored approach to business evolution.

"We are honored to receive this recognition from Inc. Magazine once again. At Rotunda, our commitment to family- and founder-led businesses remains unwavering. Our model is built on a partnership-driven approach, providing the resources and expertise that empower lower middle-market companies to drive significant growth," said John Fruehwirth, Managing Partner of Rotunda Capital Partners. "It’s incredibly rewarding to see our partner companies transform into data-driven, growth platforms poised for long-term success."

“It has been a complicated few years for growth companies and the companies that fund them,” said Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “So we are happy to share with our readers the best, latest guidance on which venture capital firms, private equity firms, and growth-capital lenders have the track record and reputation of being especially good partners to founders and CEOs.”

To compile the list, Inc. went straight to the source: entrepreneurs who have sold to private equity and venture capital firms. Founders filled out a questionnaire about their experiences partnering with private equity, venture capital, and debt firms and shared data on how their portfolio companies have grown during these partnerships.
