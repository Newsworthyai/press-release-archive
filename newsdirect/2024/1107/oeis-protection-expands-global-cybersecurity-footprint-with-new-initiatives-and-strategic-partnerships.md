Under Dr. Mourise’s guidance, OEIS has expanded its influence through collaborations and strategic partnerships, offering tailored cyber-protection and consulting services that meet the evolving needs of clients across diverse industries.

With a deep-seated commitment to social responsibility, Dr. Mourise has positioned OEIS Protection as a pioneer in the intersection of cybersecurity and humanitarian efforts. The firm actively supports anti-trafficking initiatives, utilizing its technological expertise to assist in the fight against human and organ trafficking. Dr. Mourise’s focus on trauma-informed care for trafficking survivors adds a unique dimension to OEIS’s approach, emphasizing both preventative measures and post-trauma support.

In addition to its cybersecurity services, OEIS Protection offers private investigation solutions, providing clients with reliable tools to safeguard their digital and personal information. These services include threat detection, data protection, and vulnerability assessments designed to address the current and future cyber risks faced by individuals and enterprises.

In January 2024, Dr. Mourise led a landmark symposium at Delphin Hall in Niagara Falls, Canada, bringing together international dignitaries and cybersecurity experts to discuss pressing issues related to global security, human rights, and mental health. Hosted by OEIS Protection, the event attracted international top officials and leaders, including local prominent law enforcement figures and cybersecurity advocates. The symposium reinforced OEIS Protection’s role as a key player in advancing international cybersecurity initiatives and promoting social responsibility within the tech industry.

In addition to her work at OEIS, Dr. Mourise is also the founder of the Lilia Redemption Foundation, an organization devoted to providing support, resources, and hope to survivors of human trafficking. The foundation began as a small, grassroots effort driven by Dr. Mourise’s experiences and insights into the struggles of trafficking survivors. Under her leadership, the Lilia Redemption Foundation has grown into an influential force in promoting psychological care, rehabilitation programs, and public awareness about human trafficking.

Dr. Mourise’s work through her foundation not only aids survivors in their recovery journey but also raises critical awareness of trafficking issues in underserved regions, aiming to end the cycle of exploitation. The foundation collaborates with global partners to create programs that address both immediate needs and long-term support, reflecting Dr. Mourise’s dedication to advocacy and social justice.
