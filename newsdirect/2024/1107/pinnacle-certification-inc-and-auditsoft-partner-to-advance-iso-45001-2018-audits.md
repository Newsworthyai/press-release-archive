Pinnacle Certification Inc. (PCI) is proud to announce a strategic partnership with AuditSoft, the industry leader in OHS auditing technology, aimed at transforming the ISO 45001:2018 certification process. This innovative collaboration introduces advanced digital solutions that will redefine ISO audits, bringing new levels of efficiency, accuracy, and value for both certification bodies and organizations.

ISO 45001:2018 is the globally recognized benchmark for occupational health and safety management systems (OHSMS), providing a comprehensive framework that helps organizations proactively manage and mitigate risks. Certification to ISO 45001:2018 demonstrates an organization’s commitment to maintaining safe, healthy, and sustainable work environments. Through independent audits by certifying bodies like PCI, organizations undergo rigorous evaluations to ensure full compliance with the Standard’s robust requirements.

Streamlined Auditing with Game-Changing Technology

AuditSoft’s ISO 45001:2018 audit tool—the first of its kind in Canada and globally —redefines how OHS audits are conducted. Designed to streamline the auditing process, AuditSoft's platform enhances workflow automation, minimizes manual data entry, and ensures standardized, consistent reporting across all audits.

“We are thrilled to partner with PCI to revolutionize the ISO 45001:2018 audit process,” said Ben Snyman, Co-Founder and CEO of AuditSoft. “Our technology optimizes every stage of the audit lifecycle, ensuring standardized audit questions, automating tedious manual tasks, and reducing error rates. This is a game-changer for certifying bodies and auditees alike, delivering not only efficiency but also the actionable insights needed to drive ongoing improvement in OHS management.”

Driving Continuous Improvement and Value Creation

Samantha Li, Chief Operating Officer at PCI, underscored the transformative impact of this collaboration. “AuditSoft’s technology is a breakthrough for ISO 45001:2018 audits, offering unparalleled ease of use for both auditors and the organizations seeking certification. By leveraging standardized audit protocols and electronic submissions, we can collect and analyze data faster and more accurately. This results in a more streamlined, insightful, and value-driven audit experience for our clients, positioning PCI at the forefront of the OHS certification industry.”

With AuditSoft’s innovative platform, PCI is committed to helping businesses not only achieve ISO 45001:2018 certification but also realize continuous improvement in their OHSMS, leading to safer workplaces and long-term success.
