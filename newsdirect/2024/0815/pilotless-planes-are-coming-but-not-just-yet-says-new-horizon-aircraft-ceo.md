Autonomous vehicles have captured the imagination of consumers in recent years. With billions of dollars invested into making driverless cars a reality, companies like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have taken the lead in pushing this technology forward. What many don’t know, however, is that the aviation industry is also on the brink of an autonomous revolution, with the market for autonomous aircraft projected to be worth some $22.71 billion by 2030.

One company using its aviation expertise to take on this challenge is Horizon Aircraft (NASDAQ: HOVR). The company, led by CEO Brandon Robinson, is seeking to shake up the future of air travel with its groundbreaking hybrid electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, the Cavorite X7. In a recent interview with Benzinga, Robinson, a former CF-18 fighter pilot, spoke about the use of autonomous technology in aviation, whether there will still be a role for human pilots and the company’s strategy for leading this transformation.

Autonomous Flight Tech And The Need For PilotsAs Robinson points out, commercial aircraft are already somewhat autonomous, with most commercial airliners able to fly and land autonomously. Despite this, most commercial aircraft still require not one but two pilots present in the cockpit.

"The air environment is very complicated and unforgiving. There are many unforeseen circumstances that often arrive, and it has been historically important to have a human in control of the aircraft in order to properly analyze the myriad of possibilities and choose an action that prioritizes safety," he explained.

However, while we might not be getting rid of pilots just yet, the industry could be on a path to pilotless flight within a decade. Robinson notes that “many commercial aircraft are largely completely autonomous now, with several able to fly the majority of the route, land and stop on the runway without any human pilot intervention. It is logical to assume that eventually, the system may evolve to have human pilots trained only in a remote monitoring role."

Horizon Aircraft’s Medium-Term OutlookWhile the technology for fully autonomous flight is still developing, Horizon Aircraft is focusing on piloted aircraft for the foreseeable future, recognizing that customer comfort and trust are paramount. However, the company is already preparing for a future where autonomous air travel could become the norm. Its current eVTOL prototype, the Cavorite X7, is equipped with advanced sensors and fly-by-wire systems that set the stage for a potentially smooth transition to autonomy when the time is right.

Long-Term Future: Autonomous Air TaxisIn the long term, Robinson sees an exciting future for autonomous flight where pilotless air taxis are as routine as taking an Uber (NYSE: UBER). Aside from the futuristic aesthetic, the potential benefits of urban air travel are massive – by taking advantage of the “third dimension” of the sky, air taxis can bypass ground traffic, stack at different altitudes and reduce congestion. This ability to keep aircraft separated improves safety and efficiency when compared to driving on roads.

Cavorite X7 Latest DevelopmentsHorizon Aircraft’s Cavorite X7 is an eVTOL, which means it can take off and land vertically – just like a helicopter. The company reports that what makes this eVTOL unique is its ability to reconfigure its wings en route to fly like a traditional aircraft, using Horizon’s patented HOVR Wing technology. This wing reconfiguration allows it to fly twice as fast as a helicopter and more efficiently. It also uses a hybrid-electric main power system, which allows it to recharge its battery array in flight and after landing.

The Cavorite X7 has already proven to perform well in hover and in slow forward flight. The company’s current flight-testing program is focused on flying at higher speeds and reaching “transition speed,” at which point the wings can reconfigure.

Earlier this year, Horizon announced a number of promising technical updates on the development of its prototype, including the validation of its patent-pending yaw control system, as well as the start of production and testing of its full-scale core vertical lifting fan technology.

With progress on the technology gaining momentum, Robinson is confident that Horizon can soon make its vision a reality.

“For the past few years there have been many groups questioning the reports calling for explosive growth across the industry. We’re now seeing technology and advanced air mobility companies mature to the point that this optimism can be justified,” said the CEO.
