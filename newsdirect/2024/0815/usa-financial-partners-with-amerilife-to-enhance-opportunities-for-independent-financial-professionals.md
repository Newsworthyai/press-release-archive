# USA Financial Partners with AmeriLife to Enhance Opportunities for Independent Financial Professionals

AmeriLife Group, LLC (“AmeriLife”), a national leader in developing, marketing, and distributing life and health insurance, annuities, and retirement planning solutions, announced today that it has partnered with USA Financial, a national wealth management firm with three registered investment advisers (RIAs), a registered broker-dealer, and a national field marketing organization (FMO) that supports its independent financial professionals and their investors. Per the agreement, terms of the deal were not disclosed.

“We couldn’t be more thrilled to partner with AmeriLife as we head into the next era of USA Financial,” said Mike Walters, Chief Executive Officer of USA Financial. “We look forward to the new doors that this partnership will open to enhance the opportunities we can bring to the table for the financial professionals and investors we serve.”

Founded in 1988 on the philosophy “plan first, invest second,” USA Financial has grown to include five distinct, subsidiary companies – USA Financial Exchange; USA Financial Formulas, USA Financial Securities, USA Financial Insurance Services, and USA Financial Advisor Advancement. Together, they deliver a comprehensive suite of products and solutions that are designed to help independent financial professionals grow their businesses, make their practices more predictable, and deliver more for their clients.

A five-time Inc. 5000 honoree that has been led by the same ownership team for more than three decades, USA Financial’s longevity and success stands as a testament to its carefully crafted approach to wealth management, financial planning, integrated technology, and operational excellence. Now, as it partners with AmeriLife Wealth Group, it will have expanded access to top-flight insights, tools, and resources to further empower its affiliated financial professionals and help them take their businesses to new heights.

“Bringing on an insurance-first, registered broker-dealer like USA Financial and its diversity of offerings opens up endless opportunities for our platform,” said Mike Vietri, Chief Distribution Officer of AmeriLife Wealth Group. “I look forward to working with Mike and his incredible team to further our ambitions to be the holistic, ‘integrator of choice’ for the modern financial professional.”
