Consensus Health, a leading New Jersey-based healthcare organization with a physician-led medical group and an Independent Physician Alliance (IPA), announced today it was named winner in The 21st Annual International Business Awards® (IBAs).

The International Business Awards are the world’s premier business awards program. All individuals and organizations worldwide – public and private, for-profit and non-profit, large and small - are eligible to submit nominations. The 2024 IBAs received entries from organizations in 62 nations and territories.

More than 3,600 nominations from organizations of all sizes and in virtually every industry were submitted this year for consideration in a wide range of categories. Stevie Award winners were determined by the average scores of more than 300 executives worldwide who participated in the judging process in June and July.

“We are honored to be a winner in the prestigious International Business Awards, especially on the heels of the recognition we recently earned here in the U.S. in the American Business Awards competition,” stated Michael Lovett, Consensus Health chief executive officer.

“According to the judging process, it was noted how ‘Consensus Health has made impressive strides in preserving clinical autonomy for independent physicians in New Jersey, demonstrated by its significant growth in providers, locations and patient enrollment in value-based care programs.’ Indeed, we have done just that, growing exponentially, particularly during the past two years, which is the period evaluated in this global program. We thank our entire team for their unwavering dedication to the Company and all our patients throughout New Jersey. We continue to work diligently each and every day to positively impact patient care statewide,” he concluded.
