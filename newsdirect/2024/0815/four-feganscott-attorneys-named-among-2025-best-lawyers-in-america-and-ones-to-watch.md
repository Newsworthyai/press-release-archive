# Four FeganScott Attorneys Named Among 2025 Best Lawyers in America 
and “Ones to Watch”

FeganScott is proud to announce that Elizabeth Fegan and Timothy Scott, managing partners of the firm, have been named to the 2025 Best Lawyers in America rating guide, and attorneys Jonathan Lindenfeld and Megan Shannon to the Best Lawyers: Ones to Watch in America list.

The annual Best Lawyers guide is one of the most respected publications in the legal industry, and for the third consecutive year, Elizabeth Fegan has been recognized in the Product Liability Litigation – Plaintiffs category for her advocacy on behalf of consumers who’ve been wronged, physically and financially, by defective products. Timothy Scott joined her in the guide, marking his fourth consecutive year of being recognized for his expertise in personal injury litigation.

“It’s fulfilling to see our attorneys ranked among the top legal talent in the nation,” said Fegan. “As we celebrate FeganScott’s fifth anniversary this year, a particular point of pride is the team we’ve built – a sentiment we’re proud to see is shared by our peers.”

For the second consecutive year, Best Lawyers recognized FeganScott attorneys Jonathan Lindenfeld and Megan Shannon as Ones to Watch for their early-career success and continued excellence in their prioritized practice areas: product liability litigation for Jonathan and mass tort and class action litigation for Megan.

“FeganScott is built on the notion that everyone deserves the opportunity to have their voice heard, and Jonathan and Megan do an exceptional job of carrying that forward for our clients,” added Fegan. “When it comes to taking on big industry players and holding them accountable for wrongdoing, Jonathan and Megan are passionate advocates you want on your side.”

The Best Lawyers in America guide is based on rigorous peer-review surveys and client evaluations and recognizes only the top 5% of elite lawyers in the nation across 150 practice areas. Best Lawyers: Ones to Watch recognizes attorneys earlier in their careers for outstanding professional excellence in private practice in America.
