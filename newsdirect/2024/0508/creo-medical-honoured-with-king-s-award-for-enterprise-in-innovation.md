--News Direct--

Creo Medical Group PLC (AIM: CREO) CEO Craig Gulliford joins Proactive's Stephen Gunnion with the news that the company has been recognised with the King's Award for Enterprise in Innovation, an accolade honouring innovative UK companies for their impact in their respective sectors.

The award highlights Creo's influence on patient outcomes through their advanced medical technologies. Gulliford emphasised the rare honour, noting that among over five million companies in the UK, only 59 received this award this year.

The company leverages a unique combination of bipolar radiofrequency energy with microwave energy, focusing on miniaturising surgical procedures. This innovation has led to significant advancements in treatment effectiveness and cost-efficiency, particularly noted in a recent NHS case study that showcased substantial economic benefits, including a reduction in theatre costs and patient hospital stays.

This recognition allows Creo Medical Group to join a select group of internationally recognised brands, enhancing their credibility and market presence. Gulliford expressed pride in the team's achievement and optimism about future innovations, particularly in addressing complex medical conditions like lung cancer. The award not only validates past efforts but also sets a high standard for the company's ongoing commitment to healthcare innovation.
