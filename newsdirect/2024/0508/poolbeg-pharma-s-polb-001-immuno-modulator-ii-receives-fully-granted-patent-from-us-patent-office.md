Poolbeg Pharma PLC (AIM:POLB, OTCQB:POLBF) chief legal officer John McEvoy joins Proactive's Stephen Gunnion with news that POLB 001's Immuno-modulator II has received the fully granted patent from the US Patent Office.

McEvoy explained the patent encompasses a class of drugs for treating and preventing hypercytokinemia (cytokine storms) in patients triggered by an immune response, applicable across multiple disease indications.

The granted patent further solidifies Poolbeg Pharma's robust intellectual property portfolio for POLB 001, potentially increasing the asset's value and making it more attractive to potential partners. McEvoy highlighted the company's ongoing efforts to strengthen and expand their IP portfolio, noting existing patents covering p38 MAP kinase inhibitors for influenza treatment and hypercytokinemia. Additional patents have been filed, particularly focusing on cancer immunotherapy applications of POLB 001.

The company has also applied for patents concerning dosage regimens based on results from their recent LPs trial, aiming to protect innovations and maintain a competitive edge in the pharmaceutical market. This strategic IP protection is crucial for safeguarding the company's products and ensuring shareholder value, particularly as they seek partnerships to further develop POLB 001.
