Nextech3D.ai CEO Evan Gappelberg joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce a substantial new order that the company has secured. In May, Nextech3D.ai received an order for over 1,000 3D AI models and more than 4,000 3D AI digital photos, with deliveries scheduled to start in June. The order, valued in the mid-six figures, underscores the company's role as a pioneer in AI technologies and its capability in creating high-resolution 3D models and renderings for e-commerce enterprises globally.

Gappelberg highlighted that this large enterprise customer has seen significant return on investment from the use of 3D models in e-commerce and is rapidly increasing its orders. Nextech3D.ai is currently engaged in direct collaborations with Amazon and other major e-commerce retailers, such as Kohlâ€™s. The company has also introduced "one-click integration" with major e-commerce platforms like Shopify, BigCommerce, and WooCommerce, which have incorporated 3D/AR features and are setting new standards for Web 3.0 in e-commerce.

Looking forward, Nextech3D.ai is optimistic about its profitability prospects for 2024, anticipating scaling revenue with an 80% profit margin as operating expenses decrease, thanks to its investment in patented AI technologies. The company's strategic move to Hyderabad, India, is also seen as a key step in aligning with its commitment to delivering cutting-edge 3D modeling and augmented reality solutions.
