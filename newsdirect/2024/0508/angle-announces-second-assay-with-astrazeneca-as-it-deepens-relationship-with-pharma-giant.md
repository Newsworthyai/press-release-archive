# ANGLE announces second assay with AstraZeneca as it deepens relationship with pharma giant

--News Direct--

ANGLE PLC chief executive Andrew Newland joins Proactive's Stephen Gunnion with details of a supplier agreement with AstraZeneca PLC to develop an androgen receptor (AR) detection assay to enhance prostate cancer studies.

With a contract value of Â£550,000, the project is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of next year.

Newland said the agreement is an extension of a prior arrangement to develop a methodology for detecting CTC micronuclei and will use ANGLE's innovative Parsortix system. Successful development of this AR assay is expected to bolster the use of the Parsortix system in clinical oncology, particularly for assessing the efficacy of prostate cancer therapies.

The discussion also touched upon the potential benefits of this development for ANGLE, suggesting it might significantly enhance the company's operations and market position.
