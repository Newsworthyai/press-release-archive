# Cloud DX secures 4th Provincial Health contract for remote patient monitoring

--News Direct--

Robert Kaul, CEO of Cloud DX, discussed with Steve Darling from Proactive the new Remote Patient Monitoring Agreement for Cloud DX RPM Services, which has been secured with a Canadian Provincial Health Authority. This agreement expands Cloud DX's provision of Connected Health remote patient monitoring products and services across Canada, now including contracts with Alberta, Yukon, Prince Edward Island, and a Master Services Agreement with Mohawk Medbuy—the country's largest hospital procurement agency.

Kaul shared with Proactive that the contract spans 36 months and includes options for two 12-month extensions. Each subscription under these contracts is projected to average $1,520 CAD annually, covering the costs associated with the Connected Health Kit, which includes patient-prescribed hardware, software, and connectivity solutions.

Over the four months leading up to April 30, 2024, Cloud DX has announced a significant growth milestone, securing 26 new contracts. These agreements span across hospitals, paramedic services, U.S. clinics, and include two Canadian provinces, marking a significant inflection point in the company’s expansion and presence in the healthcare industry.
