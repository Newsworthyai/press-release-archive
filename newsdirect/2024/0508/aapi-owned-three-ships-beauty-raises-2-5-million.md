“We’re so grateful for investors like BDC’s Thrive Venture Fund who not only believe in our mission but share our values,” adds Laura Burget, co-founder of Three Ships Beauty. “We have great products that really work, and our customers love them. Now we can grow that awareness and make natural, effective skincare accessible to more people.”

“It has been truly remarkable to witness Three Ships Beauty’s impressive growth, expanding customer traction and recognition in the North American market,” said Mona Minhas, Partner, Thrive Venture Fund. “The company’s evolution to date, coupled with their steadfast commitment to improving transparency and sustainability in the skincare industry, fills us with anticipation for their next exciting phase of growth.’’

To start off 2024, they unveiled First Light Vitamin C + Caffeine Eye Cream – one of their most highly requested products – selling one unit every 30 seconds on launch day.

Connie and Laura were listed in Forbes 30 Under 30 Class of 2022, and received the EY Entrepreneur of the Year® in Ontario (2022), and RBC Canadian Women Entrepreneurs of the Year (2021).
