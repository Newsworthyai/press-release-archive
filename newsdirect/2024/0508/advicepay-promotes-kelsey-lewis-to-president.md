--News Direct--

AdvicePay, the industry-leading platform for processing payments and overseeing compliance of fee-for-service financial planning, announced today that it has appointed Kelsey Lewis as President, promoting the former Head of Customer Success to the No. 2 position at the company, where she will closely collaborate with founder and CEO Alan Moore to execute on his vision.

Lewis joined AdvicePay in December of 2021 as the firm’s first Head of Customer Success and helped build the team and systems that ensure AdvicePay is delivering on its promises to customers. In that role, Lewis worked with many of the industry’s largest RIAs and broker-dealers, overseeing customer success and support efforts, including onboarding, relationship management, and solutions consulting. Her efforts helped AdvicePay achieve a 36% increase in transaction volume while maintaining a 100% enterprise customer retention rate.

“After conducting a thorough search that included internal and external candidates, the board unanimously agreed that Kelsey is the right person to help lead this company into the future,” Moore said. “Kelsey has been a key contributor to AdvicePay’s leadership team, and this promotion reflects her commitment to our customers and her passion for furthering AdvicePay’s strong culture and mission. I look forward to working with her to create a blueprint for delivering on our ambitious growth strategy as industry and consumer demand for fee-for-service planning continues to grow over the next several years.”

In her new President role, Lewis will serve as an Integrator, overseeing day-to-day company management and ensuring all departments are working closely to execute on the strategic goals of the company. She will also serve as the highest point of escalation for customers.

“I am incredibly, deeply honored to take on this new role at AdvicePay, a company whose core values resonate deeply with me.” Lewis said. “Having spent most of my career in a customer-facing role, I am acutely aware of their needs and priorities. We are serving more advisory firms than ever, and by elevating me to this important leadership position from being Head of Customer Success, AdvicePay and its Board are demonstrating their customer-centric focus and commitment at the highest level. I am committed to nurturing the collaborative and people-first culture of AdvicePay as we continue to grow.”

Before joining AdvicePay, Lewis held positions as the Director of Operations at a consumer goods company, and before that, was the Director of Client Experience at a learning management software company. Lewis earned her MBA from the University of Utah – David Eccles School of Business. She graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in marketing from Westminster University.
