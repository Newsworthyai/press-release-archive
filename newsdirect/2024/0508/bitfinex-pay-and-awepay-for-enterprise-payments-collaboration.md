# Bitfinex Pay and Awepay for Enterprise Payments Collaboration

--News Direct--

Awepay.io, a digital payments technology provider known for its early pioneership of financial technologies for mainstream and alternative merchant segments for South East Asia has been welcome as the latest enterprise member for Bitfinex Pay, an emergent payment gateway that enables users to pay online for goods and services using a variety of cryptocurrencies popular today.

The agreement, formalized on 8th April 2024, sees Awepay.io playing a catalytic role in accelerating the mainstream retail adoption of the most used cryptocurrencies such as, but not limited to Bitcoin, Lightning, Ethereum and Tether stablecoins as a form of payment for products and services offered by both online and physical merchants.

“Inclusivity is key to progress. Awepay.io, through the early days of fintech, has worked tirelessly to develop payment solutions that empower the unbanked and underbanked across the globe to make and accept payments without geographical borders. This collaboration comes at a strategic time with traditional online payments becoming the norm, and cryptocurrency acceptance becoming more mainstream. Hence, the market is ready to embrace cryptocurrencies,” commented K.C. Seow, the CEO.

Awepay.io will play the essential role of onboarding merchants to accept cryptocurrency payments for their products and services by integrating the Bitfinex Pay API into their e-commerce checkout methods, or to Point Of Sale (POS) systems used by physical retail merchants.

Seow explains, “This is a welcome challenge – it goes beyond conversion of our existing merchant database. At this time, the majority of ‘click’ and ‘brick’ merchants both still need extensive education, training and support to fully reap the benefits of this new payment method. This same familiarization needs to extend to their customers and employees, so our first goal is to do this fast, widely and effectively while providing resource-efficiency to all stakeholders.”

Awepay.io, armed with its own software capabilities, will also play a key role in acquiring invaluable merchant and user feedback to help Bitfinex Pay improve the crypto payment system, features and user experience moving forward.
