# Own Up and Move Forward from a Crisis: Reputation Expert Ray Hennessey Explores Elements of a Lasting Apology in a New Book, Beyond Sorry

--News Direct--

Everyone messes up. In relationships. In business. In life. It’s a fact of human nature that we’re flawed. People aren’t inherently bad, but humans tend to do a lot of bad things. In the digital age, so much of our personal and professional behavior can be suddenly thrown into public view. In a new book, Beyond Sorry: How to Own Up, Make Good and Move Forward After a Crisis, author and reputation expert Ray Hennessey lays out the framework for people to offer sincere and lasting apologies that can help resurrect their careers or personal lives in the digital age.

“Repairing a reputation isn’t easy,” Hennessey said. “It takes more than a simple apology. That’s what I meant to convey in the title — Beyond Sorry — taking the extra steps to ensure you can fight all the hurdles in your way.”

Most people have engaged in behavior they’re not proud of, whether personally or professionally, and humans are prone to imperfect traits and impulses. History, literature, and music have given us examples of falls from grace, tragedies, and fatal flaws for centuries. Beyond Sorry explores the steps readers need to take to move forward, including finding the right words, delivering the message with credibility, taking ownership of actions and behaviors, and living a life that shows you’re worthy of another chance.

In a social media-driven world, Hennessey’s message becomes even more important.

“The human tendency to fail those around us has changed from a personal crisis to one with a large audience often clamoring for some measure of retribution,” Hennessey said. “As humans, professionally and personally, we find ourselves at risk of lasting reputational damage if we don’t find a way to recover and move forward.”

Hennessey is Executive Partner and Chief Executive of Vocatus, a marketing and messaging consulting firm that works with companies and individuals in financial services and other industries. He is a frequent speaker on the topic of reputation management and digital communications. With more than 25 years of media, marketing, and management experience, Hennessey previously served as Editorial Director for Entrepreneur Media, helped launch the FOX Business Network, and appeared regularly on CNBC and CBS News. Earlier in his career, he was an editor at SmartMoney.com and Dow Jones, where he wrote the IPO Outlook column for The Wall Street Journal.
