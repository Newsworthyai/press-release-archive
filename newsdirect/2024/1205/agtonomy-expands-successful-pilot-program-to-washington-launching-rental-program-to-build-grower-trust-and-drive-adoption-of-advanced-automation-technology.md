# Agtonomy Expands Successful Pilot Program to Washington, Launching Rental Program to Build Grower Trust and Drive Adoption of Advanced Automation Technology

Agtonomy, a leader in software and services for advanced automation and AI solutions, announced the expansion of its successful pilot program to Washington state’s permanent crop industries. Building on the achievements of its California pilot, this new rental program is designed to increase adoption of advanced automation technology by providing an opportunity for all growers to experience the benefits of automation firsthand.

This versatile rental model provides fruit, nut and wine grape growers with the choice of electric or diesel Agtonomy-enabled platforms to automate core repetitive tasks, such as mowing, spraying, weeding, and transporting crops, to save time and increase operational efficiency while fostering confidence in adopting advanced technology.

“Our expansion into Washington is just the start of a broader journey,” said Tim Bucher, Agtonomy’s co-founder and CEO. “We understand that growers want solutions that are practical, reliable and tailored to deliver the most value. Our rental program offers a cost-effective entry point into automation while offering growers the chance to see the impact in their fields before making a long-term commitment.”

This expansion underscores Agtonomy’s dedication to collaborating with growers, gathering valuable feedback directly from users and incorporating their insights into refining its software and services. The rental program allows growers to "try before they buy" and includes flexible options including seasonal or multi-year rentals, all backed by a 30-day guarantee. This unique approach reflects Agtonomy’s commitment to building meaningful, long-term partnerships with growers by offering practical, risk-free solutions tailored to their needs and to providing reassurance and adaptability as they explore innovative technology on their own terms.

Meeting Growers Where They AreAgtonomy’s rental program builds on the success of its California pilot, where growers achieved gains in efficiency and productivity. By integrating advanced automation into their operations, growers can accomplish more with fewer resources, as Agtonomy’s platform enables a single operator to manage an entire fleet of equipment. This not only streamlines operations but also empowers existing labor by upskilling workers to use innovative technology, helping them transition into higher-value roles.

“We are partnering with Agtonomy for the third year in a row,” said Simon Graves, director of vineyard operations at Treasury Wine Estates’ Americas division, part of the Australia-headquartered Treasury Wine Estates, a long-time client of Agtonomy. “We’ve increased the effectiveness of emerging in-field AI farm equipment technologies by working with Agtonomy to introduce new features that respond to the specific conditions on our vineyards. Automation and AI at our Californian sites is just one component of our broader approach to sustainability across our global operations.”

Looking Ahead: Expanding Across the U.S. and BeyondThe Washington expansion marks the beginning of Agtonomy’s larger growth strategy, with plans to bring its innovative automation solutions to other regions in the U.S. and internationally. By leveraging insights gained from its pilot and rental programs, Agtonomy is poised to scale its operations, meeting the growing global demand for efficient, cost-effective farming solutions.

“Automation is not just about technology; it’s about empowering growers with the tools they need to succeed,” Bucher said. “Our rental program is a stepping stone toward building a more sustainable and productive agricultural system, and we’re excited to partner with growers globally to make that vision a reality.”
