It’s a movement, a celebration, and a moment to reflect on the creative energy that’s shaping the future of independent music.

Bryan Biniak, President of Songtradr, Bandcamp’s parent company, stated “We’re deeply committed to working with artists and labels to create unique spaces where they can thrive and fans can discover music they’re passionate about. The Best of 2024 is more than a list; it’s a testament to the vibrant, growing community that powers this platform. We’re excited about the growth Bandcamp has experienced this year and even more excited to continue innovating our tools and product features to make music discovery and artist support better than ever.

Edward Keyes, Editorial Director, Bandcamp. “Curating these lists is always a labor of love because it means so much to us to reflect the diversity and brilliance of the music our community has championed all year. It’s something we’re deeply proud to share, and we hope it inspires fans to connect even more deeply with the artists they love.”
