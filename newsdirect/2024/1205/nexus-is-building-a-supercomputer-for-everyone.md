# Nexus is Building a Supercomputer for Everyone

Today, Nexus is announcing the Nexus network testnet will launch next week. This next phase of open participation marks a critical milestone towards building a supercomputer for everyone and making the Verifiable Internet a reality. Verifiable computation will enable new ways of coordination and communication for everything from media and information to managing how large language models are trained and deployed.

Nexus introduced the first global distributed prover network that aggregates the collective power of almost any device, from massive GPU farms to smartphones, to protect the integrity of data and computation. To do this, Nexus is using the latest advancements in cryptography, computer science, mathematics, engineering, and open source to develop technologies – the Nexus zkVM and Nexus network – to enable verifiable computation at hyperscale.

In October, Nexus took its first steps in building a computing network of unprecedented scale with the beta release of the Nexus network – the first distributed open prover network. More than 70,000 people from over 187 countries participated in the beta launch by contributing compute power to the Nexus network. The community proved a total of 732 million cycles using the shared compute of participants’ devices, with a peak total network speed of 813 Hz (cycles per second).

On December 9th, the next phase of community participation will begin with the launch of the Nexus testnet. With the Nexus testnet, users can start contributing compute to the Nexus network and participate in the growth of the Nexus supercomputer. Nexus is working with partners like Gevulot, BCW and CodeStream AI to provide professional-grade compute capacity to the Nexus network.

Participating in the Nexus network testnet is simple and can be done via computer or smartphone. Users can start contributing to the Verifiable Internet in two ways:

1. Visiting beta.nexus.xyz — from there, users can simply connect via a browser to contribute compute.
2. Joining the network via a CLI, or a Command Line Interface. This option allows users and developers to contribute by running a prover on their computer beyond the limitations of a browser.

The Nexus testnet introduces new noteworthy elements to participants:

* Nexus points: contributions to the network are reflected in the form of Nexus points.
* Nexus account: users can now connect your ProverID with emails to use the same account across multiple devices.
* Upgrades: users will experience a number of performance improvements including network stability upgrades and an auto-update function for the CLI network users.

Nexus is an ambitious Silicon Valley-based startup led by CEO & Founder Daniel Marin, recognized in the 2025 Forbes 30 Under 30, and Chief Scientist Jens Groth, the inventor of the Groth16 protocol. Marin began developing Nexus as a cryptography student at Stanford University and went on to raise $27.2 million from leading tech investors Lightspeed Venture Partners, Pantera Capital, Faction, Dragonfly Capital, Alliance, Blockchain Builders Fund, and SV Angel.

“At Nexus, we're building a supercomputer that enables verifiable computation, to prove all the Internet’s computations,” said Daniel Marin, CEO and Founder of Nexus. “The importance of this achievement by the scientific community is hard to overstate: there have only been a few moments in history when a new form of computation has been introduced. With verifiable computation, we are turning decades of research and theory into reality.”

“Today, we are leveraging the advancements in science, engineering and new economic forces to productize this technology and build a marketplace for compute. With the launch of our testnet, we're inviting everyone to participate in the Nexus network with the click of a button.” said Marin.

The new Nexus testnet will be live from December 9th at 9:00 am PT to 9:00 am PT on December 13th. By participating in the Nexus testnet and joining a network of connected devices, users can help lay the foundation for a compute infrastructure that makes the Internet more secure and trustworthy

The testnet will go live at beta.nexus.xyz on Monday, December 9 at 9:00 am PT. For more information, please see this Nexus blog post.
