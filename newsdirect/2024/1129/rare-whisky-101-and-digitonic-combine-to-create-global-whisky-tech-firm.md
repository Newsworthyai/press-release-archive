The deal will see Digitonic take a controlling interest in Rare Whisky 101, with Digitonic co-founder and CEO Grant Fraser becoming CEO and taking a board position at Rare Whisky 101.

Advanced discussions are now taking place with North American investors to help grow Rare Whisky 101 internationally during 2025.

Rare Whisky 101 is a global leader in the valuation of rare whisky, and provides collectors and investors with worldwide data insight into the investment performance and prospects of malt whisky collections.

Digitonic has been at the forefront of technology and marketing since incorporation and provides specialist technology to listed businesses around the world, developing proprietary software which helps firms attract new customers and investors.

The combination of the two companies will help Rare Whisky 101 reach new audiences and develop its technology platform. Plans are underway to provide the growing international market of whisky investors with advanced tools and data-driven insights for investment decisions.

Grant said: "This partnership is about blending the best of two worlds: the timeless artistry of rare whisky and the power of technology. Together, we'll create new opportunities for collectors and investors, bringing them unprecedented value and experiences covering ownership enjoyment and investment.

"I'm honoured to lead both companies into this exciting new chapter, which is down to the extraordinary talent of the Digitonic team and the trust of the people behind Rare Whisky 101.

"Digitonic's mission has always been to innovate and create meaningful value. This deal marks the start of delivering our vision for how rare whisky is collected, valued, and appreciated."
