--News Direct--

Cavitation Technologies CEO Neil Voloshin joined Steve Darling from Proactive to share updates about the company's advanced fluid processing technologies with Steve Darling from Proactive.

Established in 2008 and publicly traded under the symbol CVAT, Cavitation Technologies specializes in enhancing the efficiency of fluid processing applications without altering existing processes. The company's technology operates by modifying the physical or molecular structure of fluids, facilitating rapid chemical reactions, and reducing the need for chemicals in various applications.

Voloshin explained that the core technology involves fluid passing through a cylinder where energy is generated, leading to the formation of nanoparticles or micro-vapor bubbles. This innovative process can handle fluid capacities ranging from 10 to 500 gallons per minute, offering versatile applications in water remediation, agriculture, vegetable oil refining, and alcoholic beverages.

Highlighting recent achievements, Voloshin mentioned a three-year renewal agreement with Desmet Ballestra from Belgium, which is expected to generate approximately $1 million in revenue for the year. He also noted that Cavitation Technologies operates with fixed annual costs of $600,000 and enjoys high gross margins of 80-85%.

Looking ahead to 2024, Voloshin expressed optimism about significant advancements in water remediation for fracking, produced water treatment, and agriculture. The company is actively engaged with government agencies and universities, focusing on developing more efficient processes that contribute to environmental sustainability. Cavitation Technologies aims to continue its trajectory of innovation and growth in the fluid processing industry.
