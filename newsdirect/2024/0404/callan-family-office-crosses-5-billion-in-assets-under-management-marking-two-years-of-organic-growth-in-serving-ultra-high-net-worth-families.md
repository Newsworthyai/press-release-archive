# Callan Family Office Crosses $5 Billion in Assets Under Management, Marking Two Years of Organic Growth in Serving Ultra-High-Net-Worth Families

--News Direct--

Callan Family Office, a registered investment advisor serving ultra-high-net-worth families, family offices, foundations and endowments across the United States, announced it has passed $5 billion in assets under management, just over two years operating as an independent RIA.

Callan Family Office, which was founded in February 2022, reported client assets of just over $5 billion in March, all from organic client and partner growth.

“We started Callan Family Office because we believed that ultra-high-net-worth families could benefit from a truly independent, entrepreneurial approach from partners who take full accountability for all aspects of family wealth,” said Jack Ginter, Partner and Chief Executive Officer of Callan Family Office. “We have been honored that families have turned to us for our institutional level of investment research and access, our planning services, and other family office support. Best of all, we are just getting started.”

While other firms have grown through acquisition or taken outside capital, Callan Family Office is owned by its 23 partners – all of whom have years of experience exclusively serving the unique needs of ultra-high-net-worth families. As of March 30, the firm maintained an average client size of $100 million.

Callan Family Office works closely with Callan LLC, which advises more than $3 trillion in assets. Through a licensing arrangement and partnership, Callan LLC – which has no ownership in Callan Family Office – gives clients access to institutional-quality research, education, and private-market deal flow that is rare among other RIAs.

Within the past 12 months, Callan Family Office has also expanded its service offerings. Last year, the firm launched its Endure program for family governance and education. Endure offers a dedicated and highly experienced team of consultants that provide advice on strategies and practices that facilitate alignment, communication, and decision-making within families and across generations. This includes advice on preparing for family business transitions, navigating family dynamics, philanthropy, preparing and educating next generations, and developing or enhancing family governance practices.

Earlier in 2024, Calllan Family Office expanded financial administration services to its clients and to other single-family offices. These enhanced services include bill pay, cash management, reconciliation, and customized reporting.

“Our team knows that every decision we make has to be in the best interests of the families and institutions that trust us with their multifaceted needs,” Ginter said. “We believe our growth validates our independent approach, and we look forward to the next chapter as we continue to build Callan Family Office.”
