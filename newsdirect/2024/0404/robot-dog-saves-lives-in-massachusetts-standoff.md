A robotic dog named Roscoe from the Massachusetts State Police Bomb Squad is being praised for its role in averting a potential tragedy involving a person barricaded in a home.1

On March 6, the Massachusetts State Police sent Roscoe into a home where a 30-year-old man, who had allegedly held his mother at knifepoint, was located. The suspect shot the robot three times, partially disabling it.

State police noted that deploying Roscoe potentially saved the lives of officers and real dogs involved in the incident.

Boston Dynamics, the company behind the Spot robot, stated that it was the first time one of their robots had been shot. The company expressed relief that the only casualty was their robot. Roscoe has been sent to Boston Dynamics for repairs, and a new unit will be provided to the state police.

Robots are increasingly being used by law enforcement agencies nationwide. In New York City, Digidogs have been employed since 2023 to help de-escalate situations. Similarly, law enforcement agencies in Florida, Los Angeles, and other states have utilized these cybernetic hounds.2

Another company deploying AI-powered robots and emergency systems to deter crime across the US is Knightscope, Inc. (NASDAQ:KSCP), a leading innovator in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies focused on public safety.

Knightscope’s autonomous security robots (ASRs) use a unique combination of self-driving technology, robotics, AI, and electric vehicles to provide humans with extra eyes, ears and a voice on the ground.

Innovative Robot Company Progresses on Path to Profitable ExpansionKnightscope deployed its first Autonomous Security Robots in May 2015 and has continued signing contracts since with major clients across the country. The company’s ASRs, Blue Light Tower emergency phones and Automated Gunshot Detection (AGD) technology is already being utilized in public spaces including schools, hospitals, HOAs, casinos, transportation hubs and places of worship.

On April 4, Knightscope, Inc. (NASDAQ:KSCP) announced 18 new contracts and five new renewal agreements that are valued at over $1 million.

The announcement comes off the back of a successful Innovation Week held by the company and its FY 2023 results, adding substantial growth in its top line revenue through new contracts.

These contracts predominantly hail from rapidly expanding sectors like transportation, healthcare, education, and local government, which not only form the bulk of the current agreements but also offer numerous prospects for further expansion across both individual clients and their markets.

Earlier this week, Knightscope, Inc. (NASDAQ:KSCP) reported its financial results for 2023, showcasing significant progress towards profitability and operational efficiency.

Knightscope reported total revenue of $12.8 million, marking a substantial 128% increase from the previous year. This growth was driven by a $2 million increase in net revenue from services, totaling $7.2 million, and a $5.2 million increase in net revenue from product sales, totaling $5.6 million. The surge in product sales was attributed to the integration of Emergency Communication Devices (ECDs) into their product lines following the acquisition of CASE Emergency Management Systems.

Total operating expenses for the year amounted to $24.3 million, a $4.4 million reduction from the previous year. This reduction was driven by lower sales and marketing costs and R&D expenses, leading to operating expenses as a percentage of revenue dropping from 509% to 190%.

Looking ahead to 2024, Knightscope has outlined a growth strategy focused on organizational restructuring, service optimization, manufacturing consolidation, and facility reduction. These initiatives aim to reduce payroll expense by over 30%, align support for key technologies with service contracts, and improve manufacturing efficiency and facility utilization.

Knightscope also plans to bolster its product offering further after signing an MOU with Draganfly (NASDAQ: DPRO), an award-winning industry leading drone developer. The company plans to integrate Draganfly’s drone technology with its ASR tech to create Autonomous Security Drones.
