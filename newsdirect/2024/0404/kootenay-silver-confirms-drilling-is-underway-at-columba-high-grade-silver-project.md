# Kootenay Silver confirms drilling is underway at Columba High Grade Silver Project

--News Direct--

Kootenay Silver CEO Jim McDonald joined Steve Darling from Proactive to provide an update on the company's drilling activities at the Columba Silver Project in Mexico. McDonald announced that drilling is underway for Kootenay Silver's Q1/Q2 diamond drilling program, which aims to explore the highly prospective D-Vein target.

The proposed drilling program includes 15-17 drillholes totaling approximately 5,000 meters. The primary objective of this program is to expand upon previous intercepts along the D-Vein target, which has shown promising signs of silver mineralization.

McDonald emphasized that the current drilling program is designed to extend the D-Vein in preparation for a follow-up program, which is likely to consist of 15,000 meters of drilling. The company aims to delineate a maiden resource by late 2024, pending additional drilling beyond the initial 5,000 meters and the necessary financing.

In addition to the D-Vein target, Kootenay Silver maintains a priority list of new vein targets and known vein extensions, all of which warrant further drill testing. The company anticipates receiving the first assay results from the current drilling program within 4 to 6 weeks, providing valuable insights into the project's potential.
