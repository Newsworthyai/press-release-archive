# 4 Stocks That Will Benefit From The Green Energy Revolution

--News Direct--

As the world races towards a sustainable future, the transition to renewable energy sources has gained unprecedented momentum. Last year, greenhouse gas emissions fell to a historic low as renewable energy in the U.S. reached an all-time high, with wind, solar, and hydroelectric plants meeting almost a quarter of the nation’s power demand, while electric vehicle sales surged to their highest levels ever.

However, a significant challenge looms. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency’s (IRENA) 1.5°C Scenario, the global fleet of electric passenger cars must surpass 2 billion by 2050 to meet climate targets. Yet, S&P Global Mobility identifies price as the primary barrier to widespread electric vehicle adoption worldwide. Consequently, companies that innovate to offer more cost-effective EV solutions stand poised to capitalize on this immense opportunity.

That is where VivoPower International (NASDAQ:VVPR) comes in. The company's main goal is to generate sustainable energy solutions to help its customers and believes that sustainability doesn't need to be expensive. This is why it has developed its own custom solutions for the EV market.

Vivo Power’s subsidiary, Tembo, provides conversion kits containing all the parts needed to convert a vehicle from an internal combustion engine (ICE) to an electric (EV). That means everything from the batteries, motors, and reduction box to charger, software, and the rest of the components that make the converted vehicle work safely and seamlessly.

The company’s current focus is on designing and building ruggedized electric vehicle solutions for various sectors, including mining, infrastructure, utilities, tourism and government services.

Tembo’s electric vehicle conversion solutions are available for some of the most widely used utility vehicle models, including the Landcruiser and Hilux, which are equipped to function in harsh environments. The main advantage here is that with these off-road EV solutions, users will incur lower maintenance and operational costs, less downtime, and won't have the need for expensive fuel infrastructure.

Tembo’s latest conversion kit is designed for the Land Cruiser and has 72kWh battery capacity and a 180 km to 190 km range with the capability to deliver 220 Nm of torque and 110kW of power, resulting in more pulling power and hill climbing capabilities than the diesel equivalent predecessor.

More importantly, Tembo’s conversion kits have received massive validation from the EV market, as illustrated by the fact that it has secured commitments and orders for over 10,000 fleet vehicle conversions from partners and customers globally to date. Through global partners with coverage across more than 50 countries and all continents, VivoPower International (NASDAQ:VVPR) has made significant inroads in a number of high-growth EV markets, like the Middle East and Asia.

In line with its mission to become the world’s leading aftermarket electrification solutions partner of choice for utility vehicle fleet owners, VivoPower International (NASDAQ:VVPR) has revealed a major upcoming corporate change.

On April 2, Vivo Power subsidiary Tembo E-LV announced that it would merge with Cactus Acquisition Corp. 1 Limited (CCTS), a NASDAQ-listed company, and change its name to Tembo Group. CCTS will issue 83.8 million shares in exchange for Tembo shares at $10 per CCTS share, which corresponds to a pre-money indicative equity valuation of Tembo of $838 million.

A total of 16.76 million Tembo Dividend Shares, representing 20% of the 83.8 million shares, will be distributed to Vivo Power shareholders, who will receive 5 Tembo Group shares for each VivoPower share held. The final merger agreement and independent fairness opinion will be finalized in May, with the merger targeted for completion by August 2024. According to its most recent quarterly filing, CCTS has $25 million in cash on its balance sheet.

Furthermore, VivoPower International (NASDAQ:VVPR) revealed that its Board of Directors authorized a capital management strategy including a stock buyback program that would allow the company to purchase up to $5 million of its outstanding common stock. This move, which is set to further increase shareholder value, will be funded using the company’s proceeds from business and asset divestitures, including spin-offs and carve-outs.

NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE:SMR) is on a mission to help power the global energy transition by delivering safe, scalable, and reliable carbon-free energy by leveraging its proprietary and innovative advanced small modular reactor (SMR) nuclear technology.

The company’s groundbreaking SMR technology is powered by the NuScale Power Module, a small, safe, pressurized water reactor that can each generate 77 megawatts of electricity (MWe) or 250 megawatts of thermal energy (gross) and can be scaled to meet customer needs through an array of flexible configurations up to 924 MWe.

Already, NuScale has an SMR project in Romania with financial backing of the United States government, amounting to about $4 billion, which is currently in its second phase of development

The company recently reported FY23 earnings, which had a number of interesting highlights. SMR had $22.8 million in revenue, missing analysts expectations by about $2.9 million and a net loss of $180.1 million compared to revenue of $11.8 million and a net loss of $141.6 million for the previous period. It ended the period with $125.4 million in cash and no debt.

According to Canaccord analysts, NuScale’s unique position within the SMR space and rising demand for power in the U.S. have put it in a strong position for potential growth, which has led to an upward revision of its price target to $6.

Aemetis, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMTX) is a renewable natural gas, renewable fuel, and biochemicals company focused on the acquisition, development, and commercialization of innovative technologies that replace petroleum-based products and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Aemetis leads the low-carbon fuels industry by building a circular bioeconomy utilizing agricultural waste to produce advanced renewable fuels that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality.​

The company owns and operates a 65 million-gallon-per-year ethanol production facility in California's Central Valley that supplies about 80 dairy farms with animal feed. in addition to operating a 60 million gallon per year production facility on the East Coast of India, producing high-quality distilled biodiesel and refined glycerin for customers in India and Europe.

AMTX recently announced it had received approval by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) of $200 million of EB-5 program investment for its Riverbank sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production plant, the dairy renewable natural gas (RNG) project, the carbon sequestration project, and energy efficiency upgrades to the Keyes ethanol plant. The Riverbank plant was designed to produce 78 million gallons per year of SAF for the aviation market and Aemetis has already secured more than $3 billion of contracts to supply airlines

"This $200 million of funding provides attractive terms at a low interest rate to fund our projects, including the dairy renewable natural gas project and the sustainable aviation fuel plant to meet rapidly increasing global demand for SAF from airlines," said Eric McAfee, Chairman and CEO of Aemetis.

Maxeon Solar Technologies (NASDAQ:MAXN) designs and sustainably produces solar panels and energy solutions for residential, commercial, and power plant customers.
