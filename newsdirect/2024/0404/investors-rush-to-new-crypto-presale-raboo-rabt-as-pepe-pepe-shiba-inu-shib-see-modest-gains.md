# Investors Rush to New Crypto Presale Raboo (RABT) as Pepe (PEPE) & Shiba Inu (SHIB) See Modest Gains

--News Direct--

Presales and ICOs are where the smart money shops for the next meme coin to explode. Any investor worth their gains knows that a new crypto presale is not something to be overlooked, as coins like Pepe and Shiba Inu have proven time and time again. Now, there’s a new crypto presale in town: Raboo. Available in stage 1 for only $0.003, this coin is setting the world alight with a 233% growth during the presale phase and an explosive 100x expected once it hits the markets. It’s not hot air; it has happened before.

Pepe (PEPE): Stratospheric Gains See Slight RetractionPepe sits in the top 5 cryptos with an enormous market cap of just a shade under $3 billion. But what is truly amazing is that Pepe’s price has grown… wait for it… 66 million percent in the last year. This is a figure easily verified on any market tracker. To imagine what a $1.00 investment in Pepe a year ago could have been worth today is the stuff fairy tales and movies are made of.

Over the last 30 days, Pepe has not been quite as ambitious, and it only saw a raise of close to 30%. It even recorded a slight loss over the last week as profit-takers laugh all the way to the Lambo dealership. Pepe’s exponential growth may be behind it, but this does not mean it cannot be repeated. There’s money in meme coins, and the new crypto presale of Raboo may just be the next million-percenter.

Shiba Inu (SHIB): Still Barking Up the Right TreeWhen Shiba Inu popped onto the scene, it was dismissed as a worthless rip-off. And then Shiba Inu proved all its critics wrong by returning yields so high that the math became absurd. Billionaires were made in less than a year as Shiba Inu dropped zero after zero beyond the decimal point to gain a market cap of over $15.5 billion.

Last year, Shiba Inu stunned the markets with a 140% gain. Shiba Inu is also suffering a bit of a profit-taking downturn for a negative candle over the last seven days, but all indicators show that the meme coins are where the smart money goes not just to grow but to go absolutely nuclear.

Raboo (RABT): The New Crypto Presale Set To ExplodeThe next meme coin to explode may be Raboo, which is now in presale. Raboo is winning hearts and minds with its innovative narrative: it’s on a mission to rid the world of useless memes that only want to ride the coattails of the great ones without adding anything of value. Raboo will fix that!

The presale is underway, and investors are already hunting Raboo tokens while the going is still good. The first spike in price will happen too soon, and then the dreaded FOMO feeling will settle in, and nobody wants that.

Conclusion:As Pepe and Shiba Inu have proven, meme coins are not to be trifled with. Raboo’s new crypto presale is nicely set up to mark it as the next meme coin to explode, bringing joy and profit to all investors.
