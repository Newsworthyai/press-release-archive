Downtown Music Holdings (DMH), the world’s largest independent service provider to the global music industry, announced today the completion of its integration strategy across its business-to-business and creator-focused businesses into a single operating company.

The complete integration, including the merger of CD Baby’s operations into Downtown Music, further expands access to Downtown’s full spectrum of services to the entire global music industry. Downtown currently supports over 4 million artists and 5,000 business clients in 150 countries who collectively generated over 1.5 trillion streams across major streaming platforms in 2023. Downtown clients won nearly 30% of the awards at the 2024 GRAMMYs.

As part of the integration, Downtown Music Holdings named Pieter van Rijn CEO of Downtown Music, reporting into Andrew Bergman, Downtown Music Holdings CEO. Based in Amsterdam and New York, van Rijn brings a wealth of experience and a proven track record of leadership within the organization and the industry. He previously served as the Group President of Downtown Music and as CEO of FUGA, which was acquired by DMH in 2020. He was appointed to the Downtown Music Holdings board in 2023.

“The integration of all of our products and services under the Downtown Music umbrella alongside Pieter’s stewardship is a truly energizing moment in our journey.
