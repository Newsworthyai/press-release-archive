# Nexalin Technology unveils positive results of clinical study for Gen-2 tACS device

--News Direct--

Nexalin Technology CEO Mark White joined Steve Darling from Proactive to share positive results from a clinical study evaluating Nexalinâ€™s Gen-2 tACS device for reducing pain in veteran patients with Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI). The study was conducted at The University of California, San Diego, and involved collaboration with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) San Diego Healthcare System, as well as the Radiology, Psychiatry, and Neurosciences Departments of UC San Diego.

mTBI is a significant concern for veterans and the general public, leading to various physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral deficits. However, effective treatments for post-concussive symptoms (PCS) are limited, and the underlying pathophysiology is not fully understood. Symptoms of PCS often overlap with those of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), further complicating diagnosis and treatment.

The clinical trial was conducted as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study over an eight-week period, involving two groups: an active tACS group and a sham tACS group. Twenty-four veteran patients with mTBI received twelve sessions of either active or sham tACS over four consecutive weeks, followed by a four-week follow-up period to assess outcomes.

The positive results from this study are significant, especially considering the substantial market potential for treatments addressing traumatic brain injuries. According to Global Market Insights, the Traumatic Brain Injuries Assessment Market is projected to reach over $7.2 billion by 2032. Nexalin's innovative approach offers promise in addressing the needs of individuals suffering from mTBI, potentially improving their quality of life and providing hope for effective treatment options in the future.
