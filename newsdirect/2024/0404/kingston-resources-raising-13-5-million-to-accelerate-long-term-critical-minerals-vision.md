# Kingston Resources raising $13.5 million to accelerate long-term critical minerals vision

--News Direct--

Kingston Resources Ltd (ASX:KSN) CEO Andrew Corbett sits down with Proactive’s Jonathan Jackson to discuss a $13.5 million capital raise, of which $8.1 million has been raised and another $5.4 million is expected through an accelerated non-renounceable entitlement offer (ANERO). The money will go to expanding the Pearse Project and completing the Tailings Mining Project at the Mineral Hill operations. The funds are earmarked for boosting production and supporting operational enhancements. Corbett highlights the strategic significance of these projects in central New South Wales, noting an expected 133% increase in payable metal year-on-year and the completion of the Tailings Project, which paves the way for hard rock mining at Mineral Hill. With the processing plant's refurbishment nearly finished, Kingston Resources is poised for a significant production ramp-up, solidifying its strategic position in the resource-rich Cobar region. Corbett's vision extends to establishing a sustainable, long-term critical minerals operation, capitalising on the company’s robust infrastructure and exploration potential.
