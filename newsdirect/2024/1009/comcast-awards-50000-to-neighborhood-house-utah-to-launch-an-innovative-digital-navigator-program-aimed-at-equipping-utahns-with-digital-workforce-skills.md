# Comcast Awards $50,000 to Neighborhood House Utah to Launch an Innovative Digital Navigator Program Aimed at Equipping Utahns with Digital Workforce Skills

Comcast is announcing a $50,000 grant to Neighborhood House to create and activate a digital navigator program serving the nonprofit’s student, adult clients, and the entire Westside community. The strategic initiative intends to help bridge the digital divide affecting Utahns, including families, seniors and vulnerable populations. The grant will allow Neighborhood House to hire staff and acquire equipment needed to provide digital opportunity and skills-based training.

Digital navigators make a clear, measurable impact in helping to close the digital divide. In fact, a 2022 Boston Consulting Group survey found that thanks to the support of digital navigators:

* More than 65% of respondents obtained internet access on a computer or tablet at home. More than 85% used the internet more frequently.Nearly 50% obtained better healthcare.
* Comcast Lift Zone locations, such as Neighborhood House, advance digital opportunity by connecting more Utahns to essential resources like digital navigators, free Wi-Fi, and digital skills development.
* Digital navigators can help someone sign up for internet service, get a device, and connect to digital skills training and other resources. They’re a trusted voice for those who don’t know where to start and can help open the door to opportunity and economic mobility.

“Neighborhood House’s partnership with Comcast is the ideal of what Corporate Philanthropy should look like,” said Jennifer Nuttall, Executive Director, Neighborhood house. Comcast is attuned to the needs of the community, and they invest in concrete ways that truly make an impact. Comcasts listens and responds to feedback from Neighborhood House, thereby enhancing our capacity to serve those most in need. We appreciate partners that help to uplift our community, making it a better place for all.”

Neighborhood House has been a Comcast Lift Zone since 2020, which means the location receives free, high-speed Wi-Fi to help serve its community. Lift Zones, and this current grant, are part of Project UP, Comcast's $1 billion commitment to advance digital inclusion through programs and community partnerships that connect people to the Internet, advance economic mobility, and open doors for the next generation of innovators, entrepreneurs, storytellers and creators.

In celebration of National Digital Inclusion Week, October 7-11, and in partnership with Telemundo Utah, Neighborhood House clients will receive 150 laptop computers to be used at home and at the Lift Zone.

“I am honored to celebrate the grand opening of the Neighborhood House's new Lift Zone. This remarkable initiative ensures that every resident on the Westside has the opportunity to harness the power of digital technology and enhance their workforce skills,” said Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall. “In an era where innovation drives progress, providing access to these resources is crucial for empowering our community. This collaboration with Comcast sets a new standard for public-private partnerships, paving the way for a more connected and resilient Salt Lake City.”

“Digital connectivity has become an essential tool in today's economy, and it’s important for individuals seeking to improve their financial situation. The Lift Zone at Neighborhood House provided by Comcast will allow our clients, and the surrounding community, opportunities to access job opportunities and submit applications, develop and enhance their computer skills and associated applications, provide secure access to manage their financial needs, and, most importantly, receive guidance and assistance in accessing government resources,” said Levi Webb, Program Services Director, Neighborhood house.

Neighborhood House offers nationally accredited toddler, preschool, afterschool and summer programs for children aged 15 months to 12 years old. The 130-year-old organization also provides day care and support services for adults who need supervised care during the day, allowing more adults in our community to age in place.

“The Comcast Lift Zone and Cyber Center have become more than just a workspace for me; it’s a crucial support system that empowers me to balance my family’s needs with my professional goals. Being able to access the internet by providing a reliable space for me to work, the center helps me manage my unique schedule, allowing me to be present for my children while excelling in my job,” said Lisa, single mother of three.

“Any effort to connect individuals and families to the internet helps bring digital opportunity across the state, which is a major goal of Comcast,” said Deneiva Knight, External Affairs Director, Comcast Mountain West Region. “Digital navigators—professionals trained to connect people to technology—play an essential role in bridging the digital gap, and we’re honored to support Neighborhood House and its efforts to empower the community, helping them confidently engage with today’s digital tools.”

Comcast is deeply committed to advancing digital opportunity in the communities it serves through expanding access to internet connectivity along with community impact initiatives and investments in Utah.

The company's community partnerships in Utah have totaled $5.2 million in cash and in-kind contributions to more than 90 local non-profits in the last 3 years. This investment includes the installation of 30 Lift Zones across the state that provide free, high-speed Wi-Fi service to local community centers.
