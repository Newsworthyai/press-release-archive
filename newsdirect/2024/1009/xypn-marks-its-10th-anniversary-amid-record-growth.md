# XYPN Marks its 10th Anniversary Amid Record Growth

XY Planning Network (XYPN), the nation’s only “Turnkey Advice and Planning Platform” for independent, fee-for-service financial planners, is celebrating its milestone 10th anniversary—highlighting a decade of consistent, long-term growth across all metrics. Over the past decade, XYPN has led a revolutionary charge to prove that next-generation advisors can deliver advice profitably and scalably to their peers still in their accumulation years and that their clients are willing to pay for it. Today it supports more than 1,900 members who serve more than 80,000 clients.

Since 2014, XYPN’s network of advisory firms has benefitted from the platform’s steadfast dedication to empowering its members and fostering their success in an ever-evolving landscape. As a result, XYPN membership has experienced an average annual growth rate of 56.7% since its inception. XYPN's Compliance team is also among the leading registrars for state RIA registrations across the country, responsible for filing 1,000 state registrations in the past five years and providing annual ADV filing support to nearly 1,000 firms in 2024 alone.

“Ten years ago, the industry insisted there was no viable way to serve next-generation clients profitably, and that they would inevitably be serviced by robo-advisors. But year-over-year membership growth and retention has proven it's not only viable, it's profitable.

We've seen it in our annual Benchmarking Studies, the YOY increase of State RIA registrations we file, and even the industry at large with the largest cycle of CFP exam takers in the past 12 months," said XYPN CEO and co-founder, Alan Moore. "We also see success metrics that we've been on a mission to achieve since our beginning: joy and fulfillment. When our members come together at our annual conference, XYPN LIVE, we witness the impact that having the autonomy to do work that aligns with their principles and the best interests of their clients has on them."

XYPN’s advisory firms have grown along with the company. According to benchmarking data collected over the past eight years, client households' median annual growth has remained steady—with a five-year CAGR of 27.1%. Even with the economic strains of COVID-19 and the subsequent high inflationary environment, XYPN has continued to mark growth in revenue and client profitability, as well as improved client relationships and staff productivity.

XYPN has taught and preached pursuing the CFP® designation and adopting a niche strategy. Today, this focus is paying off, as numbers show that CFP® certificants are outperforming non-CFP®s, and advisors with a niche are outgrowing those without a niche. Additionally, XYPN Academy's training programs further support this effort by teaching new advisors how to select and implement a viable niche that will turbocharge their growth and success.

XYPN’s Benchmarking Studies have shown those with a niche focus, such as specializing in serving a particular profession or age group, have seen greater success at the scaling phase of their business—when the firm or advisor is serving 75+ clients. These advisors have enjoyed 50% larger revenue growth than advisors who serve a more generalized client base.

Additionally, the service model allows XYPN advisors to meet the needs of a large yet underserved clientele: young professionals who have a healthy income while contending with significant complexities such as student loans and how to manage that burden alongside priorities like getting married and starting a family or launching a business.

Throughout the past 10 years, as its members' needs have grown, XYPN has expanded its offerings to serve them better. In 2016, it rolled out a suite of compliance services and solutions, including RIA registrations, ADV updates, and compliance tax management systems, designed to reduce the time its members spend managing records and filings so they can focus more on their clients and financial planning. Two years later, XYPN introduced a bookkeeping solution, followed by XYPN Archive, developed to meet financial advisors’ specific recordkeeping and compliance requirements. In 2024, XYPN rolled out a pilot corporate RIA affiliation program, XYPN Sapphire for advisors who prefer a more plug-and-play technology and compliance system, built to serve fee-for-service advisors with no asset minimums, letting them focus on the financial planning for their clients.

“As we’ve grown as an organization, we've made it a top priority to continually invest in our members by scaling to provide the support that advisors truly need,” said XYPN President Vince Hockett. “XYPN is the complete resource that provides advisors with the help they need to be successful. We’re so proud of all we’ve accomplished over these past 10 years and look forward to continuing to support financial advisors in all aspects of running their business.”
