# Sarytogan Graphite tests show Ultra-High Purity Fines enhance cathode conductivity

--News Direct--

Sarytogan Graphite Ltd (ASX:SGA) managing director Sean Gregory sits down with Proactiveâ€™s Jonathan Jackson to share insights on the successful testing of Sarytogan Ultra-High Purity Fines (UHPF) and its impact on the production of new product types.Sarytogan has announced the effective testing of UHPF as a cathode conductivity enhancer in various battery applications. This breakthrough leads to the development of three distinct product categories - Micro-crystalline Carbon for industrial uses, Uncoated Spherical Purified Graphite (USPG) for Li-ion battery anodes and UHPF for advanced applications, including in the nuclear sector.The testing demonstrated UHPF's efficiency in AA alkaline battery cathodes and can linings, and in lithium monofluoride (Li/CFx) battery cathodes, catering to sectors like medical, aviation, and military.Looking ahead, Sarytogan plans to conduct long-term testing on USPG cells, assess Coated Spherical Purified Graphite (CSPG) in Li-ion anodes, and aims to complete the pre-feasibility study (PFS) by the third quarter of 2024. Gregory emphasises the strategic approach of Sarytogan in maximising the value of the vast Sarytogan Graphite Deposit by diversifying its product applications, particularly in the burgeoning lithium-ion battery market.
