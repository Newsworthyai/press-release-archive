In 1941, a little-known editorial assistant at Timely Comics published his first comic, ‘Captain America Foils the Traitor's Revenge’. That someone then went on to gain fame as Stan “The Man” Lee – and the world of comics and superheroes was forever changed. Stan Lee was a towering figure in the industry, creating classics like Spiderman, Iron Man, Black Panther and many others. His legacy is everywhere and central to the world of superheroes. As of November 2023, the Marvel Cinematic Universe had earned more than $29 billion, making it the biggest movie franchise ever. While Stan Lee has passed, the world he created is long-lasting and is showing no signs of slowing down.

Kartoon Studios (AMEX: TOON) is one of the global companies working hard to keep Stan Lee’s vision alive. It is a global company specializing in creating, producing, distributing, marketing and licensing entertainment brands. With a diverse portfolio of original animated content, including popular shows such as Stan Lee's Superhero Kindergarten, Shaq's Garage, Rainbow Rangers and Llama Llama, Kartoon Studios seems to have established itself as a prominent player in the entertainment industry.

Kartoon Studios, which is the controlling partner of "Stan Lee Universe, LLC," has recently unveiled a new dedicated storefront on Amazon, exclusively featuring products related to Stan Lee. This Stan Lee storefront, powered by Meteor, offers a wide range of branded apparel and merchandise adorned with graphics that pay homage to the legendary "Godfather of Comics." This new storefront further enhances the brand's connection with its digital community of passionate fans.

“The launch of our first Stan Lee dedicated storefront with Amazon and Meteor is game-changing for our brand because it offers an incredible, far-reaching, and trusted e-commerce store to provide Stan’s legion of tens of millions of devoted fans globally, access for the first time to Stan Lee merchandise,” shared Andy Heyward, Chairman & CEO of Kartoon Studios. “In building an engaged community, we are also providing the framework for recurring revenue and growth opportunities. We are confident this program has the capacity to significantly grow Stan Lee Universe both in the U.S. and globally.”

In a divided world, Stan Lee’s pen often brought communities together. Stan Lee is well-known throughout the industry as someone who not only created amazing stories of heroes triumphing over evil but as someone who decried injustices in real life. The legend spent a lifetime condemning racism and creating characters that every little boy and girl could relate to, regardless of their background and heritage. Kartoon Studios is firmly intent on keeping Stan Lee’s legacy alive.

The company has also announced the launch of the "Stan Lee Presents" channel on YouTube. With a subscriber count of already over 300,000, this newly rebranded channel, previously known as "Cinematica," will be managed by Frederator Networks, a subsidiary of Kartoon Studios and one of YouTube's largest animation networks.

“Stan Lee’s immense creativity, his relatable characters, and his groundbreaking storytelling style had a significant global influence on the world of entertainment and pop culture, from Star Wars to The Simpsons. To honor his incredible legacy, we are launching ‘Stan Lee Presents’ to continue to share his vision of storytelling to his millions of fans around the world,” shared Heyward.

Dedicated to everything Stan Lee, "Stan Lee Presents" will feature a diverse range of content sourced from Stan's personal archives, digital Stan Lee comic books, exclusive interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, seldom-seen historical materials as well as sneak peeks of upcoming projects from the Stan Lee Universe. The channel will be an exclusive destination for clips, trailers, interviews and more related to Stan Lee.

“Stan Lee’s popularity and fan base continue to grow with new generations of fans discovering his talent and magic, and we will continue to create opportunities for fans to engage whether it be through the Amazon storefront or new products and experiences we have in the pipeline,” shared Lloyd Mintz, SVP of Global Consumer Products, Kartoon Studios.
