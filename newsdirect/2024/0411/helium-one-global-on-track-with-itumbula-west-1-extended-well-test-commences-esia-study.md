# Helium One Global on track with Itumbula West-1 extended well test, commences ESIA study

--News Direct--

Helium One Global Ltd CEO Lorna Blaisse and director of operations Mike Williams take Proactive's Stephen Gunnion through the latest progress on the company's Rukwa project in Tanzania.

Blaisse told Proactive Helium One has initiated an environmental and social impact assessment study (ESIA), essential for converting its prospecting licence to a full mining licence, marking a significant advancement. This step follows the success of the Phase Two drilling campaign, where it achieved a 4.7% helium flow from the Itumbula West-1 well. The upcoming extended well test (EWT) is crucial for evaluating the project's value in the Rukwa Basin, facilitating the licence conversion process. The assessment, expected to take six months, is underway, running in parallel with preparations for the extended well test and a feasibility study.

Williams said the company has appointed a production facilities management company and started a design study for a helium production plant. This plant aims to refine helium and manage logistics for transporting the product. The modular design will accommodate varying production rates, ensuring value for stakeholders.

Preparations for the extended well test in the third quarter are on schedule, involving significant logistical and engineering efforts due to the importation of equipment from outside Tanzania, Williams added.

Behind the scenes, work on converting the mining licence continues, encompassing a comprehensive feasibility report integrating various company departments. Close collaboration with the Tanzanian government and stakeholders is ongoing, with recent positive meetings with the Mining Commission highlighting the government's support for the project.

With the acceleration of the project, Blaisse Helium One is expanding its team to manage the increasing workload and ensure the delivery of all project components, including the crucial feasibility study.
