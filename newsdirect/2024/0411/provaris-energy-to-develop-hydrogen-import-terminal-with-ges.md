# Provaris Energy to develop hydrogen import terminal with GES

--News Direct--

Provaris Energy Ltd (ASX:PV1) CEO Martin Carolan sits down with Proactive’s Jonathan Jackson to discuss its collaboration with Global Energy Storage (GES) to develop a gaseous hydrogen import terminal in Rotterdam. GES is recognised for its development of a versatile import terminal capable of handling ammonia and hydrogen in various states, aligning seamlessly with Provaris’s objectives. The collaboration involves a pre-feasibility study (PFS) to assess the economic and technical feasibility of employing Provaris’s H2Neo compressed hydrogen carriers. This study will look at establishing a sustainable hydrogen supply chain to the European market. Carolan highlights the synergy between Provaris’s innovative transport solutions and GES’s terminal development expertise, aiming to enhance green hydrogen availability for European industrial consumers. This partnership is set to deliver a scalable hydrogen import solution, promoting energy transition in Europe. The next steps include finalising the PFS and developing a marketing strategy for the terminal, where Provaris will manage hydrogen transportation using H2Neo carriers and GES will oversee the terminal’s discharge and integration into the hydrogen grid. This initiative marks a significant step towards a cost-effective and sustainable hydrogen economy in Europe.
