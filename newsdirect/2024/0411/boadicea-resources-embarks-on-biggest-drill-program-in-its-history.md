--News Direct--

Boadicea Resources Ltd (ASX:BOA) chair and managing director Cath Norman joins Jonathan Jackson in the Proactive studio to discuss the companyâ€™s most extensive drilling campaign in its history with the aim of uncovering major lithium and nickel deposits in Western Australia. Norman talks about BOA's strategic pivot towards exploring nickel, lithium and gold, capitalising on Western Australia's rich mining landscape. BOA holds 15 strategic tenements across the Lake Johnston, Eastern Goldfields and Fraser Range areas and is set to start drilling at three lithium projects in Lake Johnston and Eastern Goldfields, followed by nickel exploration in Fraser South, near the lucrative Nova-Bollinger mine. Norman sees 2024 as a transformative year, with BOA fully funded for exploration. The company's collaboration with industry giant IGO Ltd underscores its ambition to discover the next big nickel deposit. The company has a revamped board and a prime exploration portfolio and believes it is poised to deliver substantial value to its shareholders.
