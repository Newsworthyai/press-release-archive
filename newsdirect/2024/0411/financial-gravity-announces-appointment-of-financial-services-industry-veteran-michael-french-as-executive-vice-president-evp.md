# Financial Gravity Announces Appointment of Financial Services Industry Veteran Michael French as Executive Vice President (EVP)

--News Direct--

Financial Gravity Companies, Inc. (OTC: FGCO), a leading provider of innovative financial services solutions, is excited to announce the appointment of Financial Services Industry Veteran Michael French as its new Executive Vice President (EVP).

As EVP, Michael will ensure that our advisors and Family Office Directors are equipped to serve their clients successfully in his new role at Financial Gravity. His experience, mentorship, and training will be invaluable.

In his prior role, Michael led the investments team at an RIA in Austin, TX. He implemented quantitative-driven portfolio strategies and efficiencies within the investments team and the firm during his tenure. He was also the primary "Investment voice" to the firm's advisors and highest-net-worth clients. Additionally, Michael was responsible for leading both internal training sessions and external presentations.

Prior to that role, Michael was the Chief Investment Officer at an RIA in the DFW area. In addition to portfolio creation and maintenance, he was responsible for creating and maintaining a proprietary liability-driven investment solution that automated the creation of investment allocations for clients throughout their retirement journey.

In his 30+ year career, Michael has worked under Nobel Laureates and in various financial services capacities around the globe.

Michael shared, "I am thrilled to be joining Financial Gravity at such a pivotal time in the company's growth and am excited to be working with a team that shares my passion for finding quantifiable ways to improve client outcomes and bring the family office experience to the mass-affluent market. In my experience, most advisors want to serve clients well but fall short because they are not able to find a platform that allows them to meet certain challenges. The opportunity to solve these challenges and remove these obstacles so that advisors, and ultimately clients, can be successful is a huge motivation. I am confident that my experience will be instrumental in helping Financial Gravity achieve its ambitious goals.”

“We are delighted to welcome Michael to the Financial Gravity team,” said Scott Winters, Financial Gravity's CEO. "Michael's proven track record of success in the financial services industry and his deep understanding of the market will be invaluable assets to our company. His appointment underscores our commitment to building a world-class team that can deliver exceptional value to our clients.”

Financial Gravity is committed to continuing its growth and success in the financial services industry. We are confident that this increase in assets under management will allow us to better serve our clients and provide them with the high-quality financial services they have come to expect from us.
