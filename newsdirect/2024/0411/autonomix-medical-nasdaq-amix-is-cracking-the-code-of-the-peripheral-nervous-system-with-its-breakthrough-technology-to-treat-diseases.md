The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is the network of nerves that extend from the brain and spinal cord to all parts of the body. Its main function is to facilitate communication between the central nervous system (CNS) and the rest of the body. The PNS is divided into two components: the somatic nervous system, which controls voluntary movements and senses, and the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary bodily functions like heart rate and digestion.

Simply put, the PNS plays a crucial role in nearly every disease because it is responsible for transmitting signals and information throughout the body. Overactive nerves, disruption, or dysfunction in the PNS can lead to a variety of health issues, including conditions like pain, cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension, as well as gastrointestinal disorders.

While many biotechnology companies are looking to treat symptoms for various conditions, Autonomix Medical Inc. (NASDAQ: AMIX) is targeting the root of the issue, which they associate with the PNS. The company’s first-in-class technology platform includes a catheter-based microchip sensing array that can detect and differentiate neural signals and perform nerve ablations, killing the nerve. This technology has the ability to sense individual neural signals with up to 3,000 times greater sensitivity than currently available technologies. The company says this breakthrough technology opens new possibilities in electrophysiology and pain management.

Autonomix Medical aims to provide a comprehensive solution that combines the detection and treatment of nerve-related disorders in a single procedure, streamlining the process and potentially improving patient outcomes. Unlike the conventional ablation approaches, Autonomix Medical reports that its technology works like a GPS, allowing doctors to identify, treat and verify the right nerves causing the issue.

The company is initially evaluating pancreatic cancer pain to demonstrate the ability of its technology. With current treatment options, pancreatic cancer-related pain can be particularly challenging to manage because it is located near critical nerves and vessels, leading to severe and treatment resistant pain. Traditional pain treatments can often prove inadequate, leaving patients in need of more effective solutions; some patients turn to opioids for relief.

If Autonomix Medical’s ongoing trial is successful, it could pave the way for the company to target larger disease markets and expand the total opportunity for their technology, which they estimate exceeds $100 billion. Additionally, Autonomix believes it has the potential to decrease nationwide reliance on opioids, which could be a win for patients and physicians alike.

Autonomix is a medical device company focused on advancing innovative technologies to revolutionize how diseases involving the nervous system are diagnosed and treated. The Company’s first-in-class technology platform includes a catheter-based microchip sensing array that has the ability to detect and differentiate neural signals with approximately 3,000 times greater sensitivity than currently available technologies. We believe this will enable, for the first time ever, transvascular diagnosis and treatment of diseases involving the peripheral nervous system virtually anywhere in the body.We are initially developing our technology for pancreatic cancer pain, a condition that can cause debilitating pain and needs an effective solution. However, our technology constitutes a platform with the potential to address dozens of indications, including in cardiology, renal denervation and chronic pain management across a wide disease spectrum.
