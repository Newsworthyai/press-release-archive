# Kincora Copper CEO Sam Spring discusses strategic exploration and partnerships

--News Direct--

Kincora Copper Ltd (TSX-V:KCC, ASX:KCC, OTC:BZDLF) CEO Sam Spring tells Proactive's Stephen Gunnion the company looking for partners for its portfolio of assets in the central west of New South Wales, Australia, a region noted for significant copper deposits.

Kincora, a copper porphyry explorer and project generator, holds a strategic position in the Macquarie Arc, featuring both early-stage prospects and advanced projects like Fairholme and Trundle, located within a globally significant mineral system with existing infrastructure.

The region has witnessed substantial mergers and acquisitions activity, including Newmont's acquisition of Newcrest and Metals Acquisition Ltd's purchase of the CSA copper mine from Glencore, indicating a high level of corporate interest and investment.

In December, Kincora secured 100% interest in the New South Wales projects, aiming to attract asset-level partners to fund extensive exploration without diluting shareholder value at the company level. With $1.7 million in cash, Kincora seeks to engage majors or mid-tier companies for this purpose, following successful models of asset-level investment that have generated shareholder value in the region.

Regarding its Mongolian assets, Kincora is exploring divestiture options to refocus capital and efforts on its Australian projects, which are the company's core focus. Recent drilling results from the Trundle project and adjacent mineralized systems have been encouraging, with preparations underway for further exploration phases.

Investors should watch for milestones including drilling by AI partner Earth AI at the Cundumbul project, advanced negotiations with asset-level partners, and the exploration of additional opportunities.
