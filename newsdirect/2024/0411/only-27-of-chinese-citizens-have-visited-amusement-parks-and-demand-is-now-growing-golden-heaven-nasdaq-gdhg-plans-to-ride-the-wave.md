The amusement park industry is having a moment in China, with interest in this form of entertainment growing. It doesn’t hurt that only 27% of the population in China has visited a theme park, presenting a big opportunity to reach the 1.4 billion people who live there.

Habits learned during the pandemic are helping drive growth in the industry. With heavy restrictions on international travel, local trips became the only option. That attitude toward travel remains today, which is driving the popularity of amusement parks. In 2019, the Chinese amusement park market was valued at RMB 40 billion. By the end of 2025, McKinsey projects it will grow to over RMB 90 billion.

One company that appears to be benefiting from this trend is Golden Heaven Group Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ: GDHG). The amusement park operator, which developed and manages six amusement parks across China, is seeing an increase in the number of visits to its theme parks. During the Chinese Spring Festival holiday which ran this past February 10 to 17, park attendance was up 28.4% year-over-year. Attendance of 100,362 sets a new record, reports Golden Heaven.

Nearby For Many The company’s six parks occupy approximately 426,560 square meters of land in aggregate and are located in geographically diverse markets across the south of China. Due to the geographical locations of the parks and the ease of travel, the parks are easily accessible to an aggregate population of approximately 21 million people, Golden Heaven says. The parks offer a broad selection of thrilling and family-friendly rides, water attractions, gourmet festivals, circus performances and high-tech facilities. For 2024, Golden Heaven wants to expand its presence in the amusement park market, enhance operational efficiency and increase investments in technology to elevate visitor experiences and improve overall customer satisfaction.

As it stands, the company is already in expansion mode, opening parks and inking deals to support long-term growth. Take Seven Rainbow Park in Anshun City, Guizhou Province. Trial operations of the 15,000 square-meter park – which has a range of attractions including a Ferris wheel, luxury carousel, zoo, ocean hall, pirate ship and bumper cars – kicked off in January. The construction of the park was completed ahead of schedule. “The trial operation results have met our expectations,” said Qiong Jin, the CEO and Chairman of Golden Heaven. “The park offers a valuable model for future projects. Our goal is to establish the park as an entertainment hub in the local area while advancing the Company's sustainable development and profit objectives."

Golden Heaven is also utilizing the capital markets to broaden its presence in the amusement park industry. It also recently made a deal with PT BESTAR JAYA, an Indonesian trading company that services large-scale supermarkets nationwide. Golden Heaven was hired to develop, staff and manage 30 to 50 indoor amusement parks in major shopping centers and supermarkets across Indonesia.

Bringing In The Revenue Beyond opening parks and expanding its market presence, Golden Heaven is entering into lease agreements that give it recurring revenue. Two worth mentioning include deals with Nanping City Dacheng Culture Communication Co., Ltd. and Zigong City Dragon Culture & Arts Co. Ltd. Golden Heaven is leasing certain land and property to Dacheng Culture to host a range of activities, including wedding photography, family photography, marriage proposal planning, Hanfu (traditional Chinese clothing) photography and various celebratory events. Dacheng Culture is paying RMB 6 million, payable quarterly, over the contract period, which extends from March 29, 2024, to March 28, 2025. Meanwhile, Zigong Culture is paying RMB 8.73 million to lease certain land and property to host a range of outdoor activities including seasonal excursions, extracurricular activities, physical competitions and talent shows. The contract period runs from March 11, 2024, to March 10, 2025. All of this is positioning the company for what it says should be profitable growth in 2024.

Travelers in China want to stay close to home and are willing to spend money to do it. They are increasingly choosing amusement parks as the preferred form of entertainment. That’s good news for companies like Golden Heaven that are making several moves to capitalize.
