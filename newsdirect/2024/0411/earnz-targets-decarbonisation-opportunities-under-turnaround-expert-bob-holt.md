# EARNZ targets decarbonisation opportunities under turnaround expert Bob Holt

--News Direct--

Earnz PLC (AIM:EARN) executive chairman Bob Holt tells Proactive's Stephen Gunnion that the company aims to position itself in the energy services sector with a focus on energy advisory, regeneration, and net zero (EARNZ).

Holt, known for his success in building companies such as Mears Group and turning around businesses in the energy sector, took control of a cash shell recently to establish Earnz. The companyâ€™s strategy revolves around capitalising on decarbonization and carbon capture opportunities, with Holt already having invested in related ventures before acquiring the shell.

Earnz is eyeing investments and acquisitions in the energy services and Net Zero sectors, specifically targeting businesses that align with the transition from gas to alternative heating solutions and broader decarbonization efforts.

Holt, emphasizing his history of success in "man in a van" businesses, suggests Earnz will likely pursue acquisitions that fit this successful model. While Earnz is currently a cash shell and cannot disclose specific targets, Holt mentions ongoing discussions with a number of businesses.
