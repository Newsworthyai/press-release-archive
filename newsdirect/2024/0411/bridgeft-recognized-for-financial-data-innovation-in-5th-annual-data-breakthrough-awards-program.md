# BridgeFT Recognized for Financial Data Innovation in 5th Annual Data Breakthrough Awards Program

--News Direct--

BridgeFT, a cloud-native, API-first wealth infrastructure software company that enables financial institutions, fintech innovators, and registered investment advisors (RIAs) to deliver better, data-driven outcomes for their clients, today announced that it has been selected as winner of the “Data Warehouse Solution Provider of the Year” award in the 5th annual Data Breakthrough Awards program conducted by Data Breakthrough, an independent market intelligence organization that recognizes the top companies, technologies and products in the global data technology market today.

BridgeFT’s WealthTech API is the industry’s first WealthTech-as-a-Service platform, offering an open API to AI and trade-ready multi-custodial data, advanced analytics, and application services. The WealthTech API eliminates the need for individual data feeds from a range of custodians and back-office providers, enabling wealth management firms and wealthtech application providers to create differentiated, next-generation wealth management applications.

“Large amounts of client and investment account data–whether from custodians, alternatives or held-away assets–is powering the wealth management industry, which is why we created the WealthTech API: to make it simpler for businesses to access these insights to further enable differentiation and accelerate growth,” said Joe Stensland, Chief Executive Officer of BridgeFT. “We are honored to receive this award from Data Breakthrough. As we continue to build out our services, this award serves as an important validation of our modern, API-first WealthTech-as-a-Service platform.”

The annual Data Breakthrough Awards is the premier awards program founded to recognize the data technology innovators, leaders and visionaries from around the world in a range of categories, including DataOps, Data Analytics, AI, Business Intelligence, Data Privacy, Data Storage and many more. The 5th annual Data Breakthrough Award program attracted thousands of nominations from across the globe.

“By offering access to complex and hard-to-get data through a modern technology infrastructure, BridgeFT allows superior data breadth and depth with value-add processing for high data quality. Providers rely on outdated legacy solutions for financial data aggregation. These processes are often riddled with inaccuracies and lengthy deployment without the relevant applications to deploy the financial data once received,” said Steve Johansson, Managing Director, Data Breakthrough. “Congratulations to BridgeFT; their WealthTech API and unique approach to data technology goes beyond data aggregation by integrating robust functionalities into its platform to make best use of the data.”
