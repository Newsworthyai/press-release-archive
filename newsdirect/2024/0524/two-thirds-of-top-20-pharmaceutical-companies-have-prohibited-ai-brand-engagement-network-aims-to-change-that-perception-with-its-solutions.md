According to a recent survey conducted by ZoomRx involving 200 professionals in the life sciences industry, over 50% of the respondents indicated that their respective companies had implemented a ban on the usage of ChatGPT, a popular generative artificial intelligence tool developed by OpenAI. Interestingly, around 65% of the largest 20 pharmaceutical companies have prohibited the tool's usage. Participants in the survey stated that the reason for this policy was mostly associated with concerns that confidential company information could be accidentally exposed to rival organizations.

It is understandable that some companies may be struggling with implementing new technology, especially in an industry where confidentiality is paramount. There have even been leaks associated with OpenAI that raise concerns for companies looking to adopt new technology but are still wary of execution. Some have even called artificial intelligence (AI) “overrated.” And while ChaptGPT may be one of the bigger names in the burgeoning field of AI, that doesn’t make it the best – there are companies offering AI that could meet the needs and allay the concerns of such healthcare companies. Simply put, not all AI platforms are created equal.

The AI Company That Is Bringing Security And Assurance To The IndustryBrand Engagement Network (NASDAQ: BNAI) (BEN), an AI company that is cementing its place against big tech giants, is working to secure a firm foothold in the AI space. The company has spent the past several years acquiring patents to enhance sound and image processing, sensor data and AI perception and understanding. The company released its AI/3D avatar prototype in 2020, showcasing BEN's ability to blend cutting-edge technology with immersive user experiences. BEN says its AI has distinguished itself from competitors through 16+ perception, understanding and response AI modules that facilitate a truly human-like interaction in the ways it can listen, see, speak and react.

BEN retains a laser focus on offering the right solution to healthcare companies and has been making progress. The company recently partnered with MedAdvisor Solutions, a global leader of pharmacy-driven patient engagement solutions, to bring BEN’s AI assistants to certain pharmacies to help enhance patient outcomes. BEN’s AI Assistant technology will be a part of MedAdvisor Solutions’ Medication Advisor product, offering its vast pharmacy network configurable, easy-to-deploy and effective AI technology.

BEN's success hinges on its lineup of conversational AI applications that facilitate superior customer experience, higher levels of automation and enhanced operational efficiency. This has been made possible by leveraging highly sophisticated proprietary large language models. These models, based on updated training and fine tuning of open-sourced large language models, are the product of extensive research and development by renowned AI thought leaders as well as advanced security methodologies.

BEN’s AI assistants are walled gardens for each business, meaning they learn and are trained on what the business specifies they learn and train on and the benefits are contained to that individual instance. It truly is the businesses’ AI. BEN’s full-stack solutions can be ring-fenced and operate without access to 3rd party systems or without an external Internet connection for companies where maximum data security and compliance are a must.

BEN says it is committed to weaving mutually beneficial relationships with businesses that have complementary capabilities and networks to deliver tangible outcomes that foster growth and success. By utilizing a proprietary model designed specifically for their needs, BEN ensures that their client's sensitive data is secure and safeguarded more effectively than if they were to opt for less protective AI programs.

While there are still companies that are nervous about adopting new technology, it is unlikely that the industry is going away; the global AI in healthcare market size was valued at $20.9 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach $148.4 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 48.1%. For companies that are hesitant, platforms like BEN may offer the security and reassurance that is needed to adapt to newer technology.
