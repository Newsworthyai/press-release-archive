The reality of climate change is becoming clearer with every passing year. As natural disasters become more frequent and more severe, growing numbers of people around the world are experiencing the consequences of global warming first-hand. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States was hit by 28 billion-dollar disasters in 2023, more than in any other year. Causing a total of $92.9 billion in damages, these disasters included tropical cyclones, tornadoes, flooding, wildfires and other severe weather events. It is no coincidence that they happened in the same year that the U.S. had its warmest winter on record.

For homeowners in the U.S., where soaring house prices are pushing more and more people to live in disaster-prone areas, the increase in natural disasters is particularly concerning.

This alarming trend underscores an urgent need to reevaluate how homes and communities are built and for more resilient solutions that can withstand these increasingly extreme conditions.

Why Concrete Homes Are The FutureIn the face of growing threats from natural disasters, concrete homes are largely safe and durable structures offering numerous advantages over traditional wood-frame houses.

Unlike wood or steel, concrete is inherently fire-proof, making it significantly more resilient to the destructive forces of wildfires. Concrete also has high structural strength and is, therefore, often more resistant to earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes. Additionally, concrete structures (depending on the mix used) are usually less susceptible to water damage, a critical advantage in flood-prone areas.

Apis Cor: Producing Safe And Resilient 3D Printed BuildingsApis Cor is a construction technology firm that is developing technology to build low-rise concrete buildings using 3D printing. With this method, a home can be built much faster than with traditional construction, expanding output and potentially reducing costs by up to 30%, according to the company.

Apis says its durable 3D-printed houses are resistant to hurricanes and earthquakes. Walls built by Apis’ robots are structurally identical to concrete block walls. This means that Apis Cor’s 3D printed walls are reinforced with rebar, and attached to the roof and foundation in the exact same way that the well-documented and widely-accepted concrete block walls are reinforced and integrated into the roof and foundation.

Apis Cor’s walls and materials have been tested using third-party, independent labs. Thanks to the design flexibility of 3D printing, structures built using its technology can also be tailored to meet specific safety requirements such as resilience to natural disasters. For example, walls could be printed thicker or specially-shaped to withstand high winds during tornadoes and hurricanes, the company states.

Apis has already used its technology to build structures in various climates, including Dubai, Texas, and Florida. It said it also received a strategic investment from the largest homebuilder in the USA and they plan to work together on a multi-unit construction project in South Florida.

Beyond Homes: Building Community ResilienceThe applications of Apis Cor’s 3D-printed concrete homes extend far beyond residential construction. The technology can also be used to build schools, community centers and other federal buildings that can serve as shelters during hurricanes and tornadoes. Apis’ tech could therefore play a role in enhancing community resilience in disaster-prone areas. In hurricane-prone areas, for example, a concrete 3D-printed school or community center could be used as a sturdy shelter for residents during an emergency.

The Need For Resilient ConstructionAs communities continue to see an increasing threat from natural disasters, the need for safer and more resilient structures is becoming increasingly important. Apis Cor’s 3D-printed concrete structures could contribute to solving this problem.

Apis Cor is currently raising funds to expand its operations and bring its technology to a broader market. For those looking to invest in such construction, this funding round may offer an opportunity to help create homes and communities that are better equipped to withstand the impacts of climate change.
