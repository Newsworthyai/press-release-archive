News Direct proudly announces the launch of TradeUp, a cutting-edge new media outreach solution powered by Instinct, poised to transform trade media dissemination and engagement. For years, newswire users have faced difficulty in effectively connecting with trade journalists due to a reliance on ill-suited methods of outreach — choosing broad industry verticals and sending press releases to generic lists of publications and anonymous writers. The most common result has been an inability to determine if journalists are engaging with their content.

TradeUp, empowered by Instinct’s innovative AI technology, represents a groundbreaking advancement in media outreach. TradeUp removes the guesswork and inefficiency offered by legacy newswires by offering a laser-focused, data-driven approach. TradeUp, allows issuers to move past generic media lists and instead begin engaging with journalists who have a genuine interest in, and have recently written about, their industry news.

Key Features of TradeUp Include:

* Precise Journalist Identification: Instinct's AI instantaneously scans millions of articles in real-time, identifying and delivering key details about journalists, including contact information, beat, publication, recently published articles and even the Domain Ranking of the publishers' websites. This ensures news reaches the appropriate targets and enables interaction with individual journalists, thereby boosting the chances for earned coverage.
* Automated Pitching: Send personalized pitches directly from the Instinct platform, streamlining media relations efforts and making it easier to connect with the most relevant journalists.
* Reach More Than Just Trade Journals: The capabilities of TradeUp extend beyond solely vertical industry publications. The platform will generate data from reporters from a wide range of media outlets, from newspapers to broadcast stations, broadening the outreach footprint and increasing the chance to earn meaningful coverage.

Elevates Trade Media Outreach Strategy

TradeUp lets News Direct customers experience the new era of trade media engagement that uses an AI-driven approach to simplify the media targeting process and amplify the message by matching content with the appropriate journalists with the precision, speed and efficiency that only AI can deliver.
