Nuestro Studios, a division of Nuestro Stories, announced today that Ruben Rabasa (“I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson”), Vivian Lamolli (“Say a Little Prayer”), and comedy influencer Alexander Arias (Mr. Red) will star in their dark fantasy short, “El Clavito”. The bilingual film, the first in a slate of three planned films by Nuestro Studios, begins production in Miami this month and is being co-produced in partnership with CSP Media Group.

“El Clavito” is the haunting story of a young couple who in the midst of a major home buying crisis are able to purchase a house from a mysterious elderly man for just $1 – and a strange condition that just might haunt them.

“This story is an adaptation of a powerful sermon I first heard 30 years ago from my late pastor so I’m extremely honored this great cast and crew are joining me to produce a truly special, awesome story,” said Manuel Ruiz-Barrera, who will direct the film, and wrote the adapted screenplay.

The film is being produced with a talented cast and production team that includes Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Colombians, Ecuadorians, and an Afro Latina lead actress. Nuestro Studios collaborated with Chicano Hollywood to find some of the actors who are joining the production.

“El Clavito” will be ready for film festival season as of November, and will become the second major production completed by Nuestro Studios this year after the recent launch of this summer’s podcast series hit, “Bistec”.
