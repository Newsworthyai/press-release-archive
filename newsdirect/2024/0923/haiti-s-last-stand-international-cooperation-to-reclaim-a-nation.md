# Haiti's Last Stand: International Cooperation to Reclaim a Nation

With a complex crisis threatening the nation's stability and security, the future of Haiti is at a critical juncture. The fundamental rights and protection of Haitian citizens are increasingly under threat by the proliferation of gang violence, rampant corruption, and severe economic challenges. The government of Haiti is increasingly calling for the support of the international community to take a coordinated approach to address these challenges; however, due to the failure of past international interventions and other geopolitical factors, the international community has been slow to respond. The initial financial support and focus on peacekeeping missions may prove futile if not supported by long-term security reform initiatives that weed out corruption and the underlying social and economic issues that fuel instability.

Over the past five years, Haiti has seen an alarming surge in gang-related activities. The capital, Port-au-Prince, is now home to over 95 gangs, part of the estimated 200 gangs operating across the country. These criminal organizations have entrenched themselves deeply within Haiti's political, economic, and critical infrastructure. The gangs now control vital resources such as ports, airports, and major transportation routes (Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, 2021). Their expansion is fueled by a range of illicit activities, including narcotics trafficking, human trafficking, arms smuggling, extortion, and political corruption (U.S. Department of State, 2021). The situation is further degraded by the corruption of Haitian politicians, wealthy families, border officials, and even members of the HNP who collude with various gangs to achieve their objectives.

The Narcotics Trade and Regional Connections

Haiti's strategic location in the Caribbean has made it a key transit point for the international narcotics trade, connecting South American suppliers with markets in North America and Europe. The country's porous borders and weak law enforcement have allowed criminal organizations to use Haiti as a hub for smuggling cocaine from Colombia and cannabis from Jamaica. These drugs often make their way through Haiti to neighboring Dominican Republic, the United States, and Western Europe (UNODC, 2020). The profits from this trade not only fuel gang activities within Haiti but also have destabilizing effects across the region.

Arms Trafficking and International Implications

Arms trafficking is another critical issue exacerbating violence in Haiti. The majority of firearms in the country are illegal and often sourced from the United States. These weapons, including high-powered rifles such as AK-47s, AR-15s, and more sophisticated high-caliber weapons, provide the gangs with a strategic advantage over the HNP. These weapons find their way into Haiti through both legal and illegal ports, as well as across poorly monitored borders (UNODC, 2020).

Human Trafficking: A Global Crisis

Human trafficking, particularly the trafficking of children, is a devastating consequence of Haiti's instability. The country has become both a source and a destination for victims of trafficking, including children exploited for forced labor and sexual exploitation. Natural disasters, such as the 2010 earthquake and Hurricane Matthew, have left many children orphaned or displaced, making them easy targets for traffickers. These children are trafficked to the Dominican Republic and other neighboring countries, where they are subjected to horrific abuses (U.S. Department of State, 2021). Combatting human trafficking in Haiti requires a multi-layered approach, including more robust border controls that include surveillance programs, enhanced victim identification and support services, and international cooperation to dismantle trafficking networks.

A Proposed Strategy Toward Security and Judicial Reform

A multifaceted approach is necessary to move forward, combining immediate security interventions with long-term structural reform initiatives. Ideally, this will require a Haitian-led International Joint Operational Task Force, supported by a Fusion Center, to gather intelligence. The task force would bring together diverse skills, including current or former law enforcement personnel and intelligence operatives with a successful track record in combatting gang-related crime. The task force's composition would include experts in counter-narcotics, human trafficking prevention, financial crime investigation, case management, profiling, interdiction, and cybersecurity. By integrating these capabilities, the task force will address the complex and interrelated challenges posed by Haiti's criminal networks.

Former interventions and support by neighboring countries and the international community lacked the required longevity and sustainability. History has proven that previous temporary victories achieved by The United Nations Peacekeeping Forces have had a pendulum effect after their extraction from the country. While these efforts have brought temporary relief, they did not address the deep-rooted issues that perpetuate instability and violence. Without integrating other intelligence and law enforcement initiatives, a peacekeeping force focused primarily on reestablishing order cannot dismantle the complex criminal networks that fuel Haiti's crises. A more sustainable and coordinated approach is necessary—one that emphasizes actionable intelligence gathering to produce accurate data and robust criminal case evidence. This strategy would significantly enhance the success rate of prosecutions, ensuring that criminals are apprehended, convicted, and sentenced appropriately.

To support this approach, a comprehensive transformation of Haiti's Criminal Justice System is essential, including the establishment of a special court dedicated to prosecuting cases related to organized crime, gang violence, and corruption. The special court would enable expedited approvals for warrants and court orders, ensuring the task force runs an effective and responsive program. Additionally, with an expected increase in the incarceration of criminals, rigorous capacity planning for the Correctional Services system is crucial. The initiative will require expanding prison facilities, improving conditions, and implementing rehabilitation programs to reduce the likelihood of repeat offenses. This multifaceted strategy would address the symptoms and causes of instability, ensuring a holistic approach to security reform and paving the way for long-term peace and security in Haiti.

According to a former Chief of the HNP, previous counter-narcotics programs supported by Haitian allies led to significant successes. However, intelligence gathered within these interventions was not retained after the completion of the program and the subsequent extraction of the international counter-narcotics personnel. For this reason, a major key-critical success factor is establishing an Operational Fusion Center, a technology-rich hub equipped with a multi-mission platform that enables actionable intelligence gathering, data processing, and analysis. The platform will serve as the central gang repository for tactical and strategic situation monitoring, with automated after-action reports and evidence collection that increases the long-term success rate of prosecutions. Mission platforms of this nature serve as an evidence repository supported by advanced technology integration capabilities such as offensive cybersecurity, drone surveillance, geolocation tools, profiling and link analysis, social media monitoring, dark web analysis, and links to criminal and financial databases. Creating a comprehensive gang database provides actionable intelligence packages that would allow for precisely targeting and dismantling these criminal networks, leading to a sustainable impact for Haiti.

Continuous monitoring of all law enforcement personnel is required to ensure that there are no links to gangs or potential weak points for exploitation, extortion, and corruption. This will include all HNP staff, port security personnel, and special units, as well as the careful selection and isolation of all Haitian staff involved in the Task Force.

Combatting the Financial Power of Gangs

Gangs in Haiti are heavily reliant on the proceeds of narcotics trafficking, human trafficking, arms smuggling, and other illicit activities. In collaboration with Haitian authorities, the international community should prioritize the seizure of assets linked to these activities while implementing rigorous financial investigations and asset confiscation programs and establishing specialized legal teams to ensure successful prosecutions. Overcoming criminal syndicates of this nature requires an intense drive to combat corruption and choke the source of their supply lines – the income that fuels and strengthens their expansion.

Reestablishing Control Over Critical Infrastructure

Gaining control over Haiti's critical infrastructure is essential for restoring order and stability. Law enforcement and interdiction personnel must secure ports, airports, and primary and secondary transportation routes to prevent the movement of illicit goods and the further entrenchment of criminal networks. The operational approach would require comprehensive security assessments and the deployment of advanced detection technologies, including container scanners, body scanners, and surveillance systems. Additionally, the regular vetting and monitoring of port and airport staff would help prevent corruption and ensure the integrity of operations.

International Case Studies: Lessons from El Salvador and South Africa

In the broader context of addressing gang violence, the approach of President Nayib Bukele in El Salvador offers a perspective worth studying. His approach to deploying military forces and his administration's aggressive tactics in implementing stringent security measures have significantly reduced crime. While these actions have effectively restored order, they also raise concerns about potential human rights violations and the erosion of democratic principles (BBC News, 2023). Bukele's methods highlight the importance of swift and decisive action for Haiti, where the situation is equally dire. This example underscores the delicate balance required in Haiti, where any intervention must be part of a broader, more holistic, and sustainable approach to security and development.

The Scorpions unit, formally known as the Directorate of Special Operations (DSO) in South Africa, was a highly effective law enforcement agency established in 1999 to combat organized crime and corruption. The unit quickly gained a reputation for its rigorous investigations and successful prosecutions of high-profile cases. One of its most notable successes was the investigation and trial of Schabir Shaik, a businessman with close ties to former Deputy President Jacob Zuma. The Scorpions uncovered a complex web of corruption, leading to Shaik's conviction on fraud and corruption charges in 2005 (Smith, 2009). This case also laid the groundwork for subsequent legal proceedings against Zuma himself. Additionally, the Scorpions were instrumental in dismantling several drug trafficking syndicates and uncovering widespread corruption within government ranks, demonstrating the unit's effectiveness in targeting organized crime and public sector corruption. Despite its eventual disbandment in 2009, the legacy of the Scorpions remains a testament to the power of a dedicated, multi-disciplinary approach to law enforcement. The question remains whether a government thwarted with corruption will allow the establishment of a task force that will shine a spotlight on their illicit dealings.

A Shared Responsibility for Change

The crisis in Haiti represents a test of the international community's commitment to peace and security. It demands urgent and sustained action. By adopting a comprehensive strategy that addresses the immediate security threats and the underlying causes of instability, the international community can help Haiti chart a course toward recovery. International collaboration with regional organizations like the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and international bodies like INTERPOL, INL, DEA, FBI, USAID, and the United Nations is essential for a coordinated response.

As we confront Haiti's challenges, the question remains: Are we, as a global community, prepared to take the necessary steps to break the cycle of violence and instability, or will we allow this crisis to deepen? The future of Haiti depends on the collective efforts of those with the expertise, resources, and commitment to drive meaningful change. If you or your organization possess the capability to contribute positively—whether through strategic partnerships, financial support, or specialized knowledge in security, justice, or humanitarian efforts—your involvement could be pivotal in shaping a secure and prosperous future for Haiti. We invite you to reach out and explore how you can play a crucial role in this mission.
