BEVEL, the award-winning head-to-toe grooming and personal care brand for men with curly, textured hair and melanin-rich skin has announced the launch of the new BEVEL Trimmer SE ($99.95) in ULTA Beauty stores and Ulta.com from September 2024.

The BEVEL Trimmer SE features a lightweight plastic body, 39% lighter than BEVEL’s Premium Trimmer, cordless power and boasts up to 4+hours rechargeable battery life, making it perfect for professionals on the go, and young men just beginning a new chapter of their grooming routines. The BEVEL Trimmer SE features the same iconic BEVEL blades as BEVEL’s Premium Trimmer, which are designed to repel dirt, oil, and buildup that causes irritation to the skin. For next-level lineups and shape-ups, the BEVEL Trimmer SE also features the Bevel Dial™️ for tool-free zero-gap adjustments.

Launched in 2013 with the pioneering BEVEL Safety Razor ($49.95), BEVEL, a Black-founded brand, revolutionized grooming industry standards with solution-orientated razors, grooming products and trimmers, and has continued to deliver premium hair, beard, shave, skin and body care products and devices that cater to the needs of Black men and men of color.

“At BEVEL we are committed to serving our customers with solutions to address their unique grooming needs, so we are thrilled to expand our partnership with Ulta Beauty and add the new BEVEL Trimmer SE to our portfolio of products and razors available at Ulta Beauty stores and Ulta.com.” said BEVEL Marketing Leader Breann Davis.

BEVEL’s retail expansion into Ulta Beauty stores and Ulta.com in 2022 further cemented the brand’s commitment to ensuring its customers had greater access to grooming and personal care products that solved their unique needs. Now, for the first time, a BEVEL device, the BEVEL Trimmer SE ($99.95) will be available in Ulta Beauty retail locations nationwide.
