# American Battery Materials Signs Letter of Intent for a Business Combination

American Battery Materials, Inc. (OTC Pink: BLTH), a U.S. based renewable energy company focused on the extraction, refinement and distribution of technical minerals in an environmentally responsible manner, announced today that it has signed a non-binding letter of intent (LOI) with a Nasdaq-listed special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) for a potential merger transaction. American Battery owns lithium mineral rights on a total of 743 placer claims covering 14,320 (approximately 22 square miles) located in the Lisbon Valley of Utah. The company’s leadership believes the Nasdaq listing will enhance the company’s ability to access capital as it grows to become a domestic producer of lithium chemicals.

“This is a logical next step for American Battery as part of our growth trajectory,” said David E. Graber, Chairman and CEO of American Battery. “Lithium is on the list of the 35 minerals considered critical to the economic and national security of the United States. Being listed on the Nasdaq will help provide us with the financial resources to reach our strategic goals.”

The SPAC and American Battery will jointly raise additional capital via a private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing transaction. The legal structure of the new entity and its estimated value may vary, depending on the agreements between the parties and the possible tax implications of any such merger. The purchase price under the LOI would be the pre-money equity of $150 million, based on information provided to date and subject to confirmatory due diligence, which would consist entirely of stock consideration.

American Battery expects to announce additional details regarding the proposed business combination when a definitive agreement is executed. No assurances can be made that the parties will successfully negotiate and enter into a definitive agreement, or that the proposed transaction will be consummated on the terms or timeframe currently contemplated, or at all. Any transaction would be subject to board and shareholder approval of both companies, regulatory approvals and other customary conditions.
