# CompleCure Partners with AGC Biologics’ Chiba Site to Develop Advanced Anti-Cancer Therapeutic Using Pioneering AMDC Technology

AGC Biologics, a leading global Biopharmaceutical Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO), announced today the company entered into a strategic service agreement with CompleCure. The partnership focuses on developing the manufacturing process for a novel anti-cancer therapeutic, which uses Antibody Mimetics Drug Conjugate (AMDC) technology—a groundbreaking advancement in cancer treatment.

AGC Biologics is developing the manufacturing process for the protein component of this new therapeutic at its facility in Chiba, Japan. The AMDC technology represents a significant evolution of Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC) therapy, offering a potentially promising new approach to cancer treatment by combining a mimetic protein structure with a chemically synthesized drug specifically designed to target and destroy cancer cells.

The therapeutic being developed by CompleCure aims to revolutionize breast cancer treatment. It is designed to achieve complete remission with minimal side effects, significantly improving patient outcomes. The protein component, which is the focus of AGC Biologics' efforts, features a complex tetrameric structure that demands advanced technologies in microbial expression for successful process development and manufacturing—an area where AGC Biologics Chiba has unparalleled expertise.

“AGC Biologics Chiba and our scientists are experts in working with complex proteins and the latest technologies. For this reason, we are an ideal CDMO site to partner with CompleCure on this innovative treatment,” said Jun Takami, General Manager, AGC Biologics Chiba Facility. “We look forward to working side by side with the CompleCure team to develop this new therapeutic that could have a revolutionary impact on breast cancer patients across the globe.”

CompleCure selected AGC Biologics as its partner based on the company’s 30-year track record as a leading CDMO, its ability to rapidly propose innovative development solutions, and its flexible production capabilities. The two companies plan to continue manufacturing the protein component at AGC Biologics' Chiba site, ensuring a seamless transition to production for further steps once the process development is completed.

This collaboration marks a significant milestone in the path toward the commercialization of AMDC-based therapeutics. By combining AGC Biologics’ development and manufacturing capabilities with CompleCure's innovative therapeutic approach, the two companies hope to bring this promising treatment to market, ultimately contributing to the improvement of quality of life (QOL) for cancer patients worldwide.
