# NowSecure Launches PTaaS to Secure Roku, WebOS, Tizen, AndroidTV and tvOS Apps

NowSecure, the leading provider of mobile app risk management solutions, has expanded its mobile Pen Testing as a Service (PTaaS) offering to include security, privacy and compliance testing for apps on popular streaming, gaming and media platforms. Delivered via NowSecure Platform, the enhanced mobile application security testing service covers platforms such as Roku, WebOS, Tizen, Android TV OS, PlayStation, Xbox, tvOS and HarmonyOS, providing comprehensive, scalable security testing to help organizations mitigate risks and protect their reputation.

Expansion of NowSecure security testing to cover apps on additional critical operating systems is essential for companies as they develop apps for connected devices.These platforms handle sensitive data like user credentials, payment information and personal preferences and run on operating systems whose security and privacy is more challenging to test.

“Building on our success in mobile application security testing for streaming apps, we’re now expanding to protect apps on TV and gaming platforms,” said NowSecure CEO Alan Snyder. “By broadening our PTaaS capabilities, NowSecure ensures that businesses can protect user data and comply with privacy mandates across a full spectrum of operating systems, from smartphones to streaming to IoT devices and everything in between.”

Why TV and Gaming Apps Require Strong Security

Streaming devices and gaming consoles now support a wide range of apps for streaming, e-commerce and more. Platforms such as Roku, PlayStation and Android TV OS are found in millions of households worldwide, making them significant targets for cybercriminals.

Security vulnerabilities on these platforms can enable attackers to access microphones and private data collected from connected systems, violating customer privacy and damaging corporate reputations. In the most severe scenarios, attackers can take control of the apps and IoT devices which can create a physical security issue in addition to the privacy issues.

NowSecure cloud subscription-based PTaaS helps developers and security teams continuously secure apps via:

* Standards-based, on-demand penetration testing to identify app vulnerabilities across multiple environments, including streaming and gaming platforms
* Integration into ticketing and vulnerability management systems and detailed reporting and remediation guidance to resolve issues before release
* Historic record and audit trail of testing results and policy attestation

Customized Security Testing Across Leading Platforms

NowSecure PTaaS is designed to meet the unique security requirements of each platform:

* Roku: Focus on vulnerabilities related to authentication, API security and user data privacy
* Tizen & WebOS: Rigorous security assessments for smart TVs from Samsung and LG smart TVs, targeting secure data transmission and code integrity
* PlayStation & Xbox: Pen testing for streaming apps and utilities that run on popular gaming consoles
* HarmonyOS & Android TV OS: Comprehensive testing for apps on these growing platforms, addressing third-party library vulnerabilities and secure communication protocols.

“As more devices integrate apps and connect to home networks, securing those apps is essential,” said Michael Krueger, senior director of application security services for NowSecure. “Our expanded PTaaS ensures that apps on these platforms meet the highest security standards, protecting customers and enabling safe digital experiences.”

Securing the Future of TV and Gaming Apps

The expanded NowSecure PTaaS offering provides companies developing apps for TV and gaming platforms with the tools they need to reduce the risk of breaches, regulatory fines and brand damage. NowSecure delivers on-demand penetration testing and actionable insights, helping organizations stay ahead of emerging threats in fast-evolving environments.
