# Cure Alzheimer’s Fund Receives Donation from Bourque Family Foundation Golf Fundraiser

Boston Bruins legend, Ray Bourque, and his family have selected Cure Alzheimer’s Fund to benefit from the annual Bourque Family Foundation annual charitable golf tournament.

Bourque Golf is an annual celebrity golf tournament hosted by the NHL Hall of Famer at The Golf Club of New England in Stratham, New Hampshire. This year, the tournament was held on August 22 and raised more than $50,000 for Cure Alzheimer’s Fund, 100% of which will be used to support research into the disease.

“We are deeply grateful to Ray, his family and the Bourque Family Foundation for joining us in the fight against Alzheimer’s Disease,” said Meg Smith, CEO of Cure Alzheimer’s Fund. “Developing effective, accessible therapies requires deep understanding of the complex causes and pathologies of Alzheimer’s. The scientists CureAlz supports are pursuing high-risk, high-reward research vital for future prevention and treatment of this devastating disease. This gift helps make progress possible.”

About the Bourque Family Foundation

In 2017, Ray, his wife, Christiane, and children, Melissa, Christopher, and Ryan, wanted to combine their charitable efforts to make a greater difference in the community and founded their own public charity, the Bourque Family Foundation. The Foundation is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that strives to continue the impact made through Ray’s leadership by supporting a wide variety of organizations, individuals, and communities in need. Since inception, the Foundation has donated nearly $1.4 million to 58 worthy charities and educational endeavors. To learn more, visit bourquefamilyfoundation.org.
