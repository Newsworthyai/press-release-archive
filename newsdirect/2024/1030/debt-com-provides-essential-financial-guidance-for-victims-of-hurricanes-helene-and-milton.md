Debt.com is providing free resources, financial counseling, and expert advice specifically tailored for hurricane victims. These services aim to help affected individuals explore their options, recover more quickly, and rebuild stronger financial foundations. The organization has also compiled a list of personal finance tips and links to government assistance programs to assist during this critical time.

Personal Finance Tips for Hurricane Victims1. Document All Damage and Expenses: Keep detailed records of storm damage, repairs, and temporary living expenses. This will be crucial for insurance claims and any potential assistance from FEMA.
2. Contact Your Insurance Provider First: Call your insurance company to understand what’s covered and how to file a claim. Homeowners, renters, and auto insurance policies may all have provisions for storm damage.
3. Reach Out for Help if You Can’t Pay Your Bills: Many creditors and utility companies offer temporary payment relief in times of disaster. Contact your lenders and service providers to ask about deferment options and waived fees.
4. Be Cautious When Using Credit: If you have to use credit cards to cover emergency expenses, be strategic. Use the card with the lowest interest rate and prioritize paying off those balances as soon as possible.
5. Create an Emergency Budget: If your income has been disrupted or you’re facing higher expenses, build a temporary budget that prioritizes essentials like housing, food, and medical care. Cut back on non-essentials until you have a clearer picture of your financial situation.
6. Avoid High-Cost Loans and Scams: After natural disasters, scammers often target victims with high-interest loans or fraudulent services. Stick to reputable sources of assistance and avoid payday loans or predatory lending.
7. Seek Professional Advice: If you’re feeling overwhelmed by your financial situation, reach out to Debt.com for a free consultation. They can help you develop a recovery plan and provide guidance on managing debt.
