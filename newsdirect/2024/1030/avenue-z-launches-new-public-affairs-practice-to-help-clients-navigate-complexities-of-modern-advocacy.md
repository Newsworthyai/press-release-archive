# Avenue Z Launches New Public Affairs Practice to Help Clients Navigate Complexities of Modern Advocacy

Avenue Z, a media and technology company, today announced the launch of its Public Affairs Group, a multidisciplinary, strategic practice designed to shape client outcomes in public and private advocacy, shareholder activism and ESG, philanthropy and civil society, and regulatory environments.

In response to the growing power and control from big media companies and tech companies, Avenue Z’s new Public Affairs Group leverages a blend of communications, media, creative, and technology to affect meaningful change. The company’s approach supports clients to achieve consensus and desired outcomes by connecting highly targeted content to the right audiences at the right time, building trust.

“The way the public is gaining information and forming perspectives has changed, and organizations need to engage their audiences across all channels in new ways,” said Nneka Etoniru, Avenue Z’s EVP of Global Brand Strategy and lead of the new Public Affairs Group. “Our solutions are uniquely positioned to help clients achieve lasting influence by guiding them through critical moments, enhancing their public image, and accomplishing their goals.”

“Making a quantifiable impact in public affairs, akin to brand marketing or reputation management, requires both human and technology-informed approach,” said Jeffrey Herzog, Avenue Z founder and CEO. “Our strength lies in blending storytelling, media, and data to create influential connections across channels - from the Wall Street Journal to TikTok."

Avenue Z’s Public Affairs practice is tailored to serve a diverse range of clients, including:

* Private Sector: Helping corporations gain consensus among decision-makers and standard bearers, secure contracts and public-private partnerships, and win necessary approval.
* Public Sector: Assisting municipal, state, and federal agencies with raising awareness, launching public health initiatives, combatting electoral misinformation, and developing educational campaigns across demographics.
* High-Profile Public Figures: Assisting in navigating public opinion, counter-influencing harassment campaigns, managing crises, and curating strategically engaging online conversations to protect their reputation.
* Charities and Philanthropies: Supporting non-profits in raising funds, advancing agendas, enhancing prestige, and navigating challenges to maximize organizational impact.
* Trade Organizations and Industry Groups: Helping industry-specific organizations advocate for their members' interests, inform external audiences on policy impact, and shape public perception of their industry.

Along with the practice launch, Avenue Z has released an insightful trends report, offering a deep dive into the latest shifts shaping public policy and communication, helping organizations stay ahead of the curve. Public Affairs Trend Report 2024: Shaping Perception and Driving Outcomes in High-Stakes Environments covers trends impacting key sectors from healthcare to fintech, venture capital, emerging tech, manufacturing, and more.

Avenue Z’s ability to lead high-stakes special situations is built on a foundation of expertise lasting more than 25 years. The company’s heritage dates back to 1998, when digital visionary and entrepreneur Jeffrey Herzog pioneered search engine marketing and later, sold iCrossing, his first digital media company, to Hearst Magazines for $450 million.
