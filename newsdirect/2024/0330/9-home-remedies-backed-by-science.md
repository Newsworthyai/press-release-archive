# 9 Home Remedies Backed by Science

--News Direct--

Many Home remedies are available to address a range of issues including colds, inflammation, and pain. While not all of these remedies are backed by scientific research, some have garnered support from scientists indicating their potential effectiveness.

You've likely experimented with a home remedy before, whether it involved herbal teas for a cold, essential oils for a headache, or natural supplements for better sleep. Perhaps you heard about it from your grandma or stumbled upon it online. Regardless, you gave it a shot, and now you're contemplating its efficacy.

The exact mechanism behind why home remedies work remains unclear. Is it due to a physiological change in the body, or is it simply the placebo effect at play? Fortunately, in recent years, scientists have delved into these questions within the confines of a laboratory.
