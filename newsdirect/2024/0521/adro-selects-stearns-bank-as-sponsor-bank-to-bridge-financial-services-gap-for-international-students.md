# Adro selects Stearns Bank as sponsor bank to bridge financial services gap for international students

Adro, a New York-based technology company enabling access to checking, savings and credit for international students and workers moving to the U.S. through its university partners, announced today Stearns Bank N.A. as its official bank sponsor.

With support from Stearns Bank N.A. to build a financial on-ramp for internationals, Adro is set to launch this summer. Product highlights include:

1. The ability to open an account before arrival in the U.S., no Social Security number required
2. Complete product access from the day of arrival, including debit and credit cards via Apple Pay and Google Wallet
3. The ability to begin building credit on Day 1, while waiting for a Social Security number to be issued, and
4. Discounted international money transfers

“As one of our earliest and biggest supporters, choosing Stearns Bank N.A. as our sponsor bank was an obvious choice,” said Amarildo Gjondrekaj, CEO and Co-founder at Adro. “Stearns has a long history of recognizing minority groups that are traditionally underserved and underbanked. They have been an invaluable resource in sharing their expertise in risk and compliance oversight. Their team has shown great appreciation towards what we’re building to improve the banking experience for internationals.”

“We believe in listening to what our community needs. Our customers and communities are increasingly more global and mobile, and we’re all about increasing inclusion and access. Empowerment for all is our mission, and partnering with Adro to offer the full breadth of financial services to international students and workers aligns perfectly with our priorities,” said Kelly Skalicky, President and Chief Executive Officer at Stearns Bank N.A.

Josh Hofer, Chief Risk and Information Security Officer at Stearns Bank N.A., who leads the fintech and innovation division adds, “We’re emerging as a leader in fintech partnership and innovation because of our strong risk management, compliance and regulatory expertise and our common-sense business approach, which we’re in a great position to leverage for Adro and its customers to expand and maximize Adro’s reach and impact.”

With its bank sponsor now confirmed, Adro’s focus remains on narrowing down and finalizing its key university partners ahead of the upcoming 2024-2025 academic year. For more information, visit www.joinadro.com/university.
