These latest cases are crafted from sustainably sourced wood burls, a material typically discarded by the lumber industry, and vibrant, colorful resin. This choice underscores Carved's commitment to environmental responsibility and innovation. The live edge wood retains the natural, raw edge of the tree, adding an organic touch to the sophisticated technology of the iPhone 15.

Every case is handcrafted at Carved's facility in Elkhart, Indiana, by a skilled team dedicated to showcasing intricate grain patterns and the swirling hues of the resin, which culminate in a masterpiece of craftsmanship. Notably, the Satellite series features designs that mimic celestial bodies, ensuring that each case is as unique as its owner.

John Webber emphasizes the exclusivity of their products, stating, “Every product added to our site is the only one of its kind and once sold, it is gone forever. This uniqueness ensures that no one else will have the same phone case as you, making each Carved case a personal statement.”

Carved's phone cases are designed to be as durable as they are beautiful. Made with a combination of real wood and resin, they provide robust protection with an average thickness of 1.6mm. The cases snugly fit the iPhone 15’s contours, protecting every nook with raised edges and tactile button covers that guard against dust while maintaining functionality.

By seamlessly integrating elements of ancient trees with cutting-edge technology, Carved's new phone cases for the iPhone 15 offer a sustainable, stylish, and practical choice for discerning consumers. These cases not only protect your device but also connect the modern digital experience with the timeless beauty of nature.
