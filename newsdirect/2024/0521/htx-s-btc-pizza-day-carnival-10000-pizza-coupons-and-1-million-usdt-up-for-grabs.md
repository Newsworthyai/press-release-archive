# HTX's BTC Pizza Day Carnival: 10,000 Pizza Coupons and 1 Million USDT Up for Grabs

Back on May 22, 2010, programmer Laszlo Hanyecz made history by purchasing two pizzas with 10,000 bitcoins. Now, fourteen years later, a mere one ten-thousandth of a bitcoin can buy a pizza. Over the past 14 years, each annual BTC Pizza Day has witnessed the remarkable journey of Bitcoin, along with the significant progress and achievements of the broader crypto community. Starting from this initial deal, Bitcoin has evolved into a globally recognized digital asset today. This development has been made possible through the collaborative efforts and support of numerous developers, investors, and users.

In honor of this significant occasion in the crypto space, HTX is launching the BTC Pizza Day Carnival, a week-long celebration filled with exciting events from different business lines such as Spot, Futures, Trade to Earn, and PrimePool. HTX is distributing 10,000 pizza coupons, which can be redeemed at physical pizza stores, and offering a million USDT prize pool to mark this historic milestone and celebrate the continuous advancement and creativity of Bitcoin and its community.
