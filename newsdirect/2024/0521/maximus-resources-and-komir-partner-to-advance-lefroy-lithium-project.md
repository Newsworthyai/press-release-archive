# Maximus Resources and KOMIR partner to advance Lefroy Lithium Project

Maximus Resources Ltd (ASX:MXR, OTC:MXRRF) managing director Tim Wither joins Proactive’s Jonathan Jackson to discuss Australian Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval to proceed with a joint venture with Korea Mine Rehabilitation and Mineral Resources Corporation (KOMIR) in which KOMIR will invest US$3 million (A$4.5 million) to earn a 30% interest in Maximus' Lefroy Lithium Project in Western Australia. The Lefroy Project is in the Eastern Goldfields lithium corridor and includes mining tenements in the lithium-caesium-tantalum (LCT) province, near Mt Marion and Bald Hill lithium mines. Maximus holds a portfolio of gold, lithium and nickel projects in the Kambalda region, with more than 335,000 ounces of gold resources. Wither highlighted the FIRB approval as a key milestone, enabling the company to advance the Lefroy Project with KOMIR’s investment. The company utilised a US$200,000 non-refundable deposit during the FIRB review to enhance geological understanding and identify promising targets at Kandui, Yilmia, and Landor through soil geochemistry mapping and a 3,000-metre RC drill program. In November 2023, Maximus intersected high-grade spodumene-bearing pegmatites at Kandui, which will be the focus of the upcoming drill program.
