# Callan Family Office Launches Business Advisory Practice to Serve Business Owners Through All Phases of their Company’s Lifecycle

Callan Family Office, a registered investment advisor serving ultra-high-net-worth families, family offices, foundations and endowments across the United States, today announced the launch of a new offering focused on supporting business owners considering transacting or transitioning their businesses.

The Business & Transaction Advisory Practice will be led by industry veterans Jeff Getty and Lisa Clifford. They educate owners on value optimization, exit option strategies, and value enhancement through due diligence preparation. Additionally, they work closely with the business owner’s legal and tax counsel on transaction structuring to minimize all levels of taxation in alignment with the client’s financial, philanthropic, legacy and estate planning goals.

“Business owners represent a large segment of the U.S. GDP and most owners’ net worth,” said Jack Ginter, Chief Executive Officer of Callan Family Office. “Before selling or transitioning, an owner should ensure that their business is in its strongest possible position to allow them to generate maximum value. Jeff and Lisa have spent decades strengthening companies and preparing them for sale. We are excited to bring them on to lead this practice and deliver holistic support to business owners during all phases of their business lifecycle.”

Getty and Clifford join Callan Family Office from Key Private Bank, where Getty led the family wealth consulting team and founded the Business Advisory practice. During his 14-year tenure, he managed a team of 12 professionals, providing support on approximately 30 to 40 transactions per year.

Getty holds a Juris Doctor and Master of Science in Taxation. In addition, he is a Fellow in the American College of Trust & Estate Counsel (ACTEC®), Accredited Estate Planner (AEP®), Certified Merger & Acquisition Advisor (CM&AA®), Certified Financial Planner (CFP®), and Certified Value Growth Advisor (CVGA®). He is author of the book The Descent is the Real Climb: The Unexpected Truths About Successful Business Transitions.

“Having spent two decades advising thriving business owners, we are thrilled to join a company synonymous with entrepreneurial success,” Getty said. “We look forward to assisting clients of Callan Family Office on how to prepare for this life-changing event.”

Clifford holds the Certified Private Wealth Advisor® designation (CPWA®) and is a Certified Merger & Acquisition Advisor (CM&AA®).

“Unlike other firms, we have an extremely narrow focus: maximize the value of our clients’ businesses in preparation for a sale,” Clifford said. “I’m proud of our work for hundreds of owners, helping them achieve their goals for their businesses and families. I look forward to delivering optimal value to Callan Family Office clients.”
