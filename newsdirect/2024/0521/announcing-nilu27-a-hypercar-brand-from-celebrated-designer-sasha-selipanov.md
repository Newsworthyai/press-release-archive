# Announcing Nilu27: a Hypercar Brand from Celebrated Designer Sasha Selipanov

Nilu27 is the company founded by Sasha and Inna Selipanov to introduce an extraordinary vehicle lineup over the next ten years. And it begins this summer with the public debut of their first vehicle: the breathtaking V12-powered NILU hypercar, which will be revealed to the public at Pebble Beach during Monterey Car Week in August.

The new company – named from a combination of the founders’ daughters’ names, Nica and Lucia – brings an unrivalled depth of automotive knowledge and expertise. Sasha’s sports car legacy includes landmarks that began with the Lamborghini Huracán before moving on to the Bugatti Chiron and Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo. Sasha was also responsible for the design of the Koenigsegg Gemera and Koenigsegg CC850, among the many vehicles stemming from his two-decade career in the automotive industry.

Nilu27 was co-founded by Inna Selipanov, who brings a wealth of marketing and business development experience to the venture. Aside from being married for more than 20 years, Inna and Sasha enjoyed dynamic collaborations during their respective stints at Genesis and Koenigsegg. Combining their complementary skill sets in this new endeavor puts them on a unique path to disrupt the industry.

CRAZY ENDEAVOR

Sasha felt sports car development had veered off course in an effort to check way too many boxes. The automotive industry’s fascination with technology has led to a plethora of technologically advanced, yet emotionally sterile products.

Sasha’s vision is to explore the DNA of what defines a sports car, focusing on an emotional engagement with each of our senses. The vision is unique in both his approach to the product and brand itself, resulting in vehicles that promise to be beautiful and brutal in equal measure.

The NILU hypercar will create an authentic analog driving experience, deploying a naturally aspirated engine designed to set the driver’s senses tingling.

“One of my most vivid childhood memories was seeing an old magazine clipping of Gilles Villeneuve in his #27 F1 car power sliding out of a corner. I instantly fell in love with the image of that visceral, beautiful beast,” Sasha recalled. “This passion took me on a rollercoaster ride through my career, culminating in Nilu27. Now, my team and I are finally able to explore the quintessential automotive themes of beauty and brutality without the limitations commonly imposed by the industry or preconceived commitments to technology. We cannot wait to present our first car this summer!”

PEBBLE BEACH DEBUT

After living in Sasha’s mind and sketchbook since 2007, his vision has taken a physical form and will be revealed first to a number of industry insiders in Los Angeles in early August. It will then be seen by the public and media for the first time on the ramp at Pebble Beach Golf Course on August 15 during Monterey Car Week.

Following its debut, the NILU hypercar will appear at a number of events and functions during the week, culminating in its appearance on the Concept Lawn at the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance on August 17-18.
