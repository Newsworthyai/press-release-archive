# Flynn Gold discovers significant high-grade gold at Link Zone

Flynn Gold Ltd (ASX:FG1) CEO Neil Marston joins Proactive’s Jonathan Jackson to discuss the discovery of a new high-grade mineralisation zone at Link Zone prospect within the Golden Ridge Project in Northeast Tasmania. A recent field mapping and sampling campaign at the historic Golden Ridge adit revealed high-grade veins, with underground grab sampling recording assays of 64.4 g/t, 37.6 g/t and 15.9 g/t gold. These findings have driven the company’s share price up by as much as 48.2%, reaching $0.04. The Link Zone prospect is strategically located between the Trafalgar and Brilliant prospects along the Golden Ridge granodiorite contact, hosting a corridor of high-grade gold mineralisation with a potential strike length of 2.5 kilometres and vertical extent of at least 500 metres. Previous diamond drilling at Trafalgar and Brilliant yielded outstanding results, with multiple intersections exceeding 100 g/t of gold at Trafalgar. This is being further investigated through an active diamond drilling campaign. The new mineralised veins at Link Zone present fresh drill targets, potentially extending the existing gold system. Currently, Phase 3 diamond drilling at Trafalgar is in progress, with samples from the first hole under laboratory analysis. The drill program aims to infill test high-grade zones from previous programs and explore extensions to known mineralisation along the gold-bearing granodiorite-metasediment contact, now extending over 9 kilometres. Marston, stated that the Link Zone results enhance their confidence in the extensive, high-grade gold system at Golden Ridge, with ongoing exploration efforts aimed at identifying additional drilling targets.
