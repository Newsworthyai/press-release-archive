# Guardforce AI expands in Thailand with new LinguaBot solution as it addresses AI demand

Guardforce AI chairwoman and CEO Olivia Wang joined Proactive's Stephen Gunnion following the launch of its LinguaBot solution in Thailand with an event in Bangkok. This initiative is part of a collaboration with iApp that began in late 2023. The LinguaBots are designed to interact with customers in various settings such as hospitals, banks, and shops, providing information and assistance.

Wang noted the success of the event, with over 50 customers attending and showing significant interest in Guardforce AI's solutions. Besides LinguaBots, the company introduced two other solutions: 'Barism,' aimed at bar management to help with reservations and orders, and another AI-based customised solution for events, enhancing customer engagement and interaction called 'Wish Note.'

Looking forward, Wang said Guardforce AI plans to expand its services in 2024 by leveraging open-source AI technologies, including GPT, to enhance its offerings in the retail and air travel sectors. The company has been operating robots as a service for over four years and aims to transform its services with these new technological advancements.
