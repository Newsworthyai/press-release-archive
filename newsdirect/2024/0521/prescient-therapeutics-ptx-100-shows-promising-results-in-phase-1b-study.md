# Prescient Therapeutics PTX-100 shows promising results in Phase 1b study

Prescient Therapeutics Ltd (ASX:PTX, OTC:PSTTF) CEO and managing director Steven Yatomi-Clarke sits down with Jonathan Jackson in the Proactive studio ahead of a presentation of the results of its PTX-100 Phase 1b study at the 15th Annual T-Cell Lymphoma Forum (TCLF) in California from June 6 to 8. The Phase 1b study targeted patients with relapsed and refractory T-cell lymphomas (r/r TCLs) and successfully met its primary objectives of demonstrating safety and determining pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Additionally, the study showed a promising preliminary efficacy with a 45% overall response rate, where five out of 11 evaluable patients responded positively to the treatment. T-cell lymphomas are a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, classified as an orphan disease with about 30,000 cases. PTX-100 has received Orphan Drug Designation from the US FDA, highlighting the need for more effective treatments for TCLs, particularly for relapsed and refractory cases. The T-Cell Lymphoma Forum is a specialised conference focused on advancements in TCL treatment, bringing together clinicians, scientists and industry professionals. Yatomi-Clarke, emphasised the importance of this platform for sharing critical research and the significance of PTX-100 in addressing an unmet medical need. The company plans to advance to a Phase 2 trial in r/r TCL, expected to commence in Q3 2024.
