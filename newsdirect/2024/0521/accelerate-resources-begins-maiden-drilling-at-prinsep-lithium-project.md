# Accelerate Resources begins maiden drilling at Prinsep Lithium Project

Accelerate Resources Ltd (ASX:AX8) CEO Luke Meter sits down with Proactive’s Jonathan Jackson to discuss the company’s first drilling campaign at the Prinsep Lithium Project near Karratha in the West Pilbara region of Western Australia. Drilling follows surface sampling indicating lithium mineralisation up to 1.68% Li2O. The maiden program will involve 48 reverse circulation (RC) drill holes totalling 3,500 metres, targeting pegmatite discoveries over a 1,500-metre strike and widths up to 60 metres. The drilling is expected to be completed by the end of June, with samples sent in batches for assaying, which will have a turnaround time of about six weeks. According to Meter, this marks a significant milestone for the company as it targets lithium mineralisation down dip of outcropping mineralisation and new pegmatite sets hidden by cover. The program focuses on the northern pegmatite system, where previous mapping and rock chip sampling have confirmed lithium presence. Initial drill holes will be completed on fenced 80-metre spaced lines, targeting surface mineralisation followed by deeper increments of approximately 50 and 100 metres below the surface. A small drill hole orientation program will also be conducted along the southern pegmatite trend to assist with planning the second phase of drilling. Prinsep is 15 kilometres south of Karratha and 35 kilometres west of the SH Mining Andover Lithium Project. It is part of the larger Karratha Lithium Project portfolio, which spans about 85 square kilometres within the Karratha-Roebourne hard-rock lithium belt. Two sub-parallel pegmatite zones have been defined, each extending over 1,800 metres with widths up to 60 metres and rock chip sample assays up to 2.06% Li2O.
