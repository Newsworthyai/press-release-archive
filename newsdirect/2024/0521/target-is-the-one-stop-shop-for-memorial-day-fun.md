# Target Is The One-Stop Shop for Memorial Day Fun

As shoppers gear up for Memorial Day, consumers are ready to kick off the summer in style - all while staying within their budgets. Recently, Author and Lifestyle Expert, Meaghan B Murphy, teamed up with Target on a nationwide satellite media tour to share tips to help people kick off their summer celebrations.

“Memorial Day is the unofficial start of summer, as friends and families prepare to gather all season long. This year, I’ve partnered with Target as my one-stop shop for all my entertaining and summertime must-haves. Target is making the summer season more affordable than ever with over 1,000 new items across the entire store, with more than half less than $15,” said Murphy.

Here are Meaghan’s top picks from food and beverage to entertaining essentials and fun-in-the-sun items for kids to stock up on:

Go-To Summer Meals: “Grilling season is big in my family (fun fact: I have three grills!), and I turn to Target for affordable and delicious summer meals and sides. Good & Gather Beef Patties make the perfect burgers and I love to pair them with the Maple Bourbon Bacon Chopped Salad kit.”

Grab-and-Go Snacks: “Favorite Day Honey BBQ Kettle Corn is a great summer party snack and my kids cannot get enough of the Favorite Day Dill Pickle Trail Mix.”

Something Sweet: “Good & Gather Black Raspberry Acai Sparkling Water is a wonderful alternative to sugary drinks and makes a perfect mocktail. The Favorite Day S'mores Cake Pop Kits are so fun as DIY activity and doesn’t require any baking.”

Water Fun with Kids: “My kids are obsessed with the SunSquad Popsicle Lounge float and Inflatable Volleyball Pool Set. Threshold has the best beach towels – I love the Medallion print – and they come in many different varieties.”

Summer Style: “Target has all the Americana-inspired apparel and accessories. I love the Denim Corset Midi A-Line Dress from Universal Thread and the Shade & Shore One Piece Swimsuit. You will not catch me anywhere without Vacation Classic Sunscreen Spray – it’s lightweight and smells amazing.”

Target also has a couple of resources to make things more convenient and save time for shoppers.
