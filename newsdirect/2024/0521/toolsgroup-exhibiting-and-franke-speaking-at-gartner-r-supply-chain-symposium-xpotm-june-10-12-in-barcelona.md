# ToolsGroup Exhibiting and Franke Speaking at Gartner® Supply Chain Symposium/XPO™, June 10-12, in Barcelona

ToolsGroup, a global leader in retail and supply chain planning and optimization software, is thrilled to announce its participation at the upcoming Gartner Supply Chain Symposium/Xpo 2024 in Barcelona, Spain, June 10-12.

The event will feature a presentation by one of ToolsGroup’s valued customers, Franke, an industry leader in home solutions, food service systems and coffee equipment, scheduled for June 11. During this session, Franke will provide insights from their digital supply chain transformation journey, showcasing how they optimized the performance of their complex manufacturing and distribution ecosystem using ToolsGroup's AI-powered S&OP solution, driven by its flagship tool, Service Optimizer 99+ (SO99+).

Franke wanted to enhance demand planning efficiency through a synchronized and integrated process, reduce manual workload to focus on value-added activities, and improve collaboration. From advanced forecasting and robust S&OP processes, Franke implemented ToolsGroup's AI-powered solution to support end-to-end planning, increase efficiency and enhance visibility.

"ToolsGroup's advanced tools are instrumental in supporting our S&OP process, providing integrated synchronization and full cross-functional transparency. This enables us to improve demand and supply planning, enhance collaboration, and achieve end-to-end data visibility, empowering us to run multi-scenario planning with confidence," said Alberto Nisoli, Global Head of Supply Chain Platform at Franke.

"Franke exemplifies all the keys to success for a digital supply chain transformation project,” remarked ToolsGroup CMO and EVP of Growth, Kevin Young. “They set clear objectives for the initiative and began their journey by implementing SO99+ to optimize supply chain performance and deliver immediate value. The value was extended by digitalizing their S&OP processes to achieve cross functional transparency and synchronization of demand and supply across the organization. We are proud to partner with Franke and to play a part in the tremendous results they are planning to achieve.”

ToolsGroup was recently recognized in the Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Supply Chain Planning Solutions. We believe this recognition underscores our commitment to delivering cutting-edge solutions that empower businesses to optimize their supply chains effectively.
