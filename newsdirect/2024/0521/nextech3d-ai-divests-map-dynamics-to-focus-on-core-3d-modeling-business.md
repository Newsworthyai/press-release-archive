# Nextech3D.ai Divests Map Dynamics to Focus on Core 3D Modeling Business

Nextech3D.ai CEO Evan Gappelberg joined Steve Darling from Proactive to reveal the company's latest strategic maneuver: the divestment of its legacy business, Map Dynamics (MapD), through a shares-for-acquisition deal with ARway.ai. MapD, a renowned real-world mapping software firm, boasts an impressive client base of over 400 clients, generating $1.2 million in annual revenue and $250,000 in EBITDA over the past 12 months ending in March 2024.

Gappelberg outlined that Nextech3D.ai's primary focus lies in the creation of 3D models for the e-commerce sector, leveraging generative AI technology. By shedding Map Dynamics, Nextech3D.ai solidifies its position as a dedicated AI-driven 3D modeling firm, a strategic direction Gappelberg has been steering towards for five years. This transition marks a pivotal moment for the company, enabling it to streamline its operations and concentrate on its core business, which caters to esteemed clients such as Amazon, Kohl's, Procter & Gamble, and Bunnings.

In terms of financial performance, Nextech3D.ai has witnessed significant improvements, with profit margins projected to soar from 30% in 2023 to an anticipated 80% in Q2. The divestiture of Map Dynamics is poised to further enhance Nextech3D.aiâ€™s profitability and bolster its growth prospects.

Moreover, Gappelberg teased forthcoming announcements slated for June 2024, including Nextech3D.ai's designation as a preferred 3D model supplier for Amazon. This development is expected to substantially elevate the company's business trajectory and is eagerly awaited by investors. Gappelberg expressed confidence in Nextech3D.ai's continued success as it capitalizes on emerging opportunities in the burgeoning field of AI-driven 3D modeling.
