# Lisata Therapeutics advances lead asset LSTA1 for treatment of advanced solid tumors

--News Direct--

Lisata Therapeutics CEO David J. Mazzo discusses the oncology company's focus and recent advancements in an interview with Proactive's Stephen Gunnion.

Lisata Therapeutics, established 18 months ago through the acquisition of Cend Therapeutics by Caladrius Biosciences, is dedicated to developing technologies aimed at treating solid tumour cancers. The company's primary product, certepetide (LSTA1) is a nine amino acid cyclic peptide designed to target and penetrate tumours. It is used in combination with chemotherapy and other cancer treatments.

Currently, the most advanced programme targets metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, with phase 2B results expected later this year.

Lisata has also received several orphan drug designations, including for pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, and osteosarcoma. Additionally, it has a rare paediatric disease designation for osteosarcoma in the US.

Mazzo highlighted discussions with regulatory authorities in Australia, the EMA, and the FDA about potential accelerated approval based on upcoming trial results. He expressed optimism about commercializing List-1 as early as 2026 under ideal conditions.

Investors can look forward to various clinical and data milestones in the next 12 to 18 months, including potential business development activities.
