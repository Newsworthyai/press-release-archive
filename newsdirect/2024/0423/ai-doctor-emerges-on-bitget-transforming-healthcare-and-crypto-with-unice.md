Aside from Bitcoin’s price achievement of surpassing its ATH, a new AI token, Unice ($UNICE) is also positioned for a massive rally of turning many investors into millionaires in this year’s bull run.

UNICE Service Overview:

UNICE is an AI-based blockchain healthcare messenger service created by doctors, aimed at developing an AI doctor capable of diagnosing diseases, prescribing medications, and performing surgeries. This project has been selected as an ecosystem project by a leading global Web3 venture capital firm and has garnered worldwide attention. UNICE analyzes users' conversational and voice data to assess their physical and mental health. Based on these assessments, UNICE provides personalized health management solutions, monitors users' mental health through regular conversations, and offers pathways to professional assistance when needed. Additionally, it ensures the secure protection of users' health data and tokenizes this data, allowing users to manage and monetize their information.

The UNICE project was initiated by a network with over 20 years of medical volunteer experience, founded by professional doctors and medical school faculty members. The management team consists of many professional doctors and medical professors, which enhances the service's reliability and provides users with more accurate and trustworthy health management services.

The data generated within UNICE, especially information about patients or potential research subjects, holds tremendous value as it can generate substantial revenue for medical-related companies. This unique capability represents a significant competitive advantage of the UNICE service.

Clear Revenue Model:

Various Revenue Generation Methods: In addition to the free services provided to users, UNICE generates revenue by offering various paid services such as premium features, personalized health care solutions, and data analysis services. Additionally, UNICE can obtain further revenue through data sharing and collaboration with medical institutions and research institutes.

UNICE Tokenomics

The UNICE platform establishes a token economy system focused on medical data, generating and distributing real economic value throughout the data lifecycle, from collection to usage. Users provide medical data, which is then classified, converted into NFTs, and sold to entities like hospitals and research institutes. Contributors receive tokens as rewards, with profits transparently distributed among participants via blockchain technology. Purchasers utilize the data for medical advancements, while users can use tokens for services within the platform. UNICE's token distribution strategy ensures long-term engagement and stable token value, promoting a balanced ecosystem between demand and supply.

$UNICE maintains a stable trading rate while waiting to launch on Bitget

In the highly competitive landscape of centralized exchanges, securing a listing on platforms like Bitget has become increasingly challenging due to stringent criteria and rigorous standards. Only projects that demonstrate reliability, quality, and potential for long-term growth can pass these stringent assessments.

Regarding price stability, UNICE has maintained a stable condition without significant fluctuations, indicating potential growth and attractiveness to holders.

Bitget is celebrating the listing of UNICE by hosting exciting trading events and attractive reward events for early adopters to attract a diverse range of users. The launch celebration includes a total prize pool of $120,000, with UNICE tokens for the first trades on Bitget and a commemorative airdrop included.
