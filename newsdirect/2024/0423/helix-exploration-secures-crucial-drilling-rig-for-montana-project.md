# Helix Exploration secures crucial drilling rig for Montana project

--News Direct--

HeLIX Exploration PLC (AIM:HEX) CEO Bo Sears tells Proactive's Stephen Gunnion that the company successfully secured a drilling rig from Treasure State Drilling for its upcoming appraisal drilling campaign at the Ingomar Dome project in Montana.

Sears highlighted the importance of this acquisition, as rig availability often poses significant challenges for operators. The Cardwell KB-150 D1D drilling rig is suited for drilling to depths of more than 8,000 feet, aligning with the project's requirements.

In addition, Sears discussed the expertise of the Treasure State Drilling team, led by Well Stenger, who has two decades of experience with this particular rig. The recent partnership with contract drilling engineers Petroleum Consultants further strengthens Helix Exploration's readiness for the third quarter drilling campaign, he added. This collaboration aims to manage all aspects of the drilling process and logistics effectively, ensuring adherence to a strict timeline.

Preparations for the campaign also include typical oil and gas preparations such as legal documentation, site development, and securing water supply.

Sears also advised investors to watch for further developments as the project progresses towards commencement. This strategic preparation positions Helix Exploration to leverage its resources effectively as it approaches a critical phase of its operations.
