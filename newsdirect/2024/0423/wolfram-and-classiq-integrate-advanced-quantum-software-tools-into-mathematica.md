# Wolfram and Classiq Integrate Advanced Quantum Software Tools into Mathematica

--News Direct--

In a landmark collaboration, Classiq, a leader in quantum computing software, and Wolfram Research, the leading computational software provider, announce a software partnership. This collaboration integrates Classiq’s cutting-edge engine within Wolfram Mathematica, offering a unified solution for the development of quantum and classical algorithms.

This integration is targeted at enabling users to leverage the robust capabilities of Wolfram Mathematica for algorithm development and utilize Classiq’s Quantum Model (QMOD) language for quantum algorithm development—all within a single, cohesive environment. This blend of technologies empowers users to define, visualize and optimize quantum algorithms with unprecedented ease and efficiency.

Key features of this collaboration are the facilitation of Classiq’s quantum algorithm compilation tailored to specific quantum hardware and ability to intricately develop quantum circuits from a high-level overview down to detailed gate operations. The integration further allows for the execution of these quantum circuits across a diverse array of backends and simulators, directly within the Mathematica notebook. This integration supports researchers by enhancing analytical capabilities, enabling continuous exploration and data assessment.

As an example of the potential of this collaboration, the Quantum Differential Equations solver exemplifies how users will be able to tackle complex challenges by defining and executing quantum algorithms like the Harrow–Hassidim–Lloyd (HHL) algorithm and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) for matrix inversion, directly from the Mathematica interface. This application highlights the power of combining classical computational methods with quantum processing to solve complex computational problems more efficiently.

“The partnership between Classiq Technologies and Wolfram Research reflects a shared commitment to advancing computational excellence,” said Nir Minerbi, CEO of Classiq. “This collaboration not only enhances the toolset available for researchers and developers, we hope to see it pave the way for groundbreaking applications across various scientific and engineering disciplines.”

"In the pursuit of applying quantum technologies to address real-world challenges, robust collaboration among industry leaders is paramount. We are delighted to unveil our strategic partnership with Classiq," remarked Mads Bahrami, quantum projects manager at Wolfram. "This partnership underscores the dedication of both entities towards crafting toolsets that empower governments, industries, and academia to tackle complex problems through quantum-classical algorithms."

The companies invite those seeking to combine the best of quantum and classical computation to reach out and explore the possibilities this computation integration brings.
