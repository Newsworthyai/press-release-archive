This innovative tool empowers laundromat and dry cleaning businesses worldwide to effortlessly create and enhance their online presence, positioning them for success in the digital era.

CleanCloud's new website builder, available for free to all CleanCloud customers, is a game-changer in the industry. It offers a simple, drag-and-drop content management system (CMS) tailored specifically for laundromats and dry cleaners. With this tool, even those with limited technical skills can build functional and visually appealing websites.

Key Features of CleanCloud's Website Builder:

This innovative feature eliminates the need for costly photography or generic stock images, making your website both distinctive and cost-effective.

SEO Enhancement: Boosting search engine rankings has never been easier. CleanCloud's builder facilitates the inclusion of relevant keywords, descriptions, and meta-tags, while all websites built with it receive at least one valuable backlink from CleanCloud.

We know that many have struggled with getting a website up and running, whether that's because of the cost of the build, lack of time, or the need for technical expertise. With our new website builder, we've made it easier than ever for every laundromat or dry cleaner owner to have their own website. Anyone with access to a computer can build a basic site that will attract more customers and ultimately grow their business."

CleanCloud's website builder represents a significant leap forward in terms of sophistication and user-friendliness compared to alternative website builders in the industry.
