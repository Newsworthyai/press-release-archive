# Cloud DX seeing customer loyalty with 2 Ontario Community Paramedic Service contract renewals

--News Direct--

Cloud DX CEO Robert Kaul joined Steve Darling from Proactive to share exciting updates with Proactive regarding the renewal of Master Deployment Agreements with paramedic services in Ontario. These agreements, spanning 12 months with an Ontario County Paramedic Service and 24 months with the Guelph Wellington - City of Guelph Paramedic Service, signify the continued partnership between Cloud DX and these healthcare providers.

In Ontario, Community Paramedic Services leverage Cloud DX's Connected Health Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) services to offer daily monitoring of vital signs, physical symptoms, and chronic conditions to seniors. Through the Cloud DX mobile app, patients can interact with paramedics, facilitating close oversight and empowering patients to manage their own care effectively.

Of particular note is the Community Paramedicine for Long-Term Care (CPLTC) program, fully funded by the Ontario provincial government to provide additional care for seniors before admission into long-term care facilities. The recent announcement of an additional $174 million CAD in funding to expand the CPLTC program from 2024 onwards underscores the importance and growth potential of this initiative.

Kaul emphasized that contract renewals are a significant sales metric for Cloud DX, demonstrating the company's ability to continue serving satisfied clients effectively. Cloud DX has successfully renewed and extended Master Service Agreements with Community Paramedic Services in 10 Ontario counties, further solidifying its position as a trusted partner in the healthcare industry.
