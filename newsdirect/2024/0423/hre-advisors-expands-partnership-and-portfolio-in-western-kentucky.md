--News Direct--

HRE Advisors is a full-service real estate advisory firm that offers brokerage, appraisal, and consulting for their client’s commercial and residential needs. HRE is thrilled to announce an expansion that will deepen the firm’s professional expertise in the area. HRE has recently partnered with Darren Hack, Angela Turner, and Davin Ramage, all of whom carry a depth of experience in commercial and residential real estate, along with other additions to the team.

Dustin Hawkins, MAI, CCIM, the Principal of HRE Advisors, looks forward to continuing the firm’s commitment to its advisory services through the vast amount of education and experience HRE offers. As such, Dustin is thrilled to bring additional experience and knowledge to the team to enhance that expertise and level of service.

Darren Hack joins HRE Advisors from Hack Building, a real estate and construction company specializing in appraisal, multi-tenant commercial buildings, tenant build-outs, repurposing, and home building. Accompanying Darren to the team are Kelly Hack, Stan Hack, and MaryAnn Cain, who provide a combined 65 years of expertise in commercial and residential real estate, buyer and seller representation, land planning, commercial development, investment properties, and more.

Sarah Riley, West Kentucky Star’s People’s Choice Realtor of the Year in 2023 and 2024, will further strengthen HRE’s ability to service the WKY region. Sarah’s experiences include a strong residential sales portfolio as well as residential property management. Sarah is among the top performing agents in the area with a strong grasp on the residential sales and investment market.

“Sarah and Kelly will strengthen HRE’s residential brokerage, ensuring strong, transparent value for our clients. Darren’s construction and development experience will add a level of service and professionalism to the firm that will give our clients an even higher level of confidence,” says Dustin.

Angela Turner is another addition to the HRE team. Since 2008, Angela has worked in and around all things real estate, starting her career in leasing and property management and obtaining her real estate license in 2013. Angela has drawn an exceptional amount of experience through her leadership role at Falconite Development. Angela’s 15 years of experience in commercial leasing, project management, and business development puts her in the top echelon of this industry.

Davin Ramage has also joined HRE to bring stability to the firm’s growing appraisal department. Davin has been immersed in residential real estate appraisal since 2016. His strong work ethic, analytical mind, and reliability quickly gave him a reputation that all of Western Kentucky has come to trust. He will also bolster HRE’s agricultural appraisal services, offering poultry, swine, and row crop advisory and valuations.

Stacey Treece is an associate appraiser with HRE. Stacey began her appraisal career in 2022 after 15 years in education. She started strong, learning from Darren at Hack Building, who says she “is one of the most gifted analytical and appraisal minds I’ve seen.”
