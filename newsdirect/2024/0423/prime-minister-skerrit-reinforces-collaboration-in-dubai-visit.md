Embracing OECS Countries Collaboration

Prime Minister Skerrit explained how the recent Memorandum of Agreement among OECS countries emphasises the importance of harmonised legislation, standardised application procedures, uniform due diligence processes, and information sharing among member states.

“It is my view that these actions are important, and they are necessary, and these are actions that we will follow through with, because there are some things that we need to do together.”

He expressed optimism about the collaborative efforts and emphasised the significance of prioritising good governance and ethical practices in the CBI sector.

The memorandum signifies a shift towards a more integrated and cohesive framework that unites diverse stakeholders under a common vision of excellence, accountability, and transparency.

Honouring Dominica’s CBI Programme

Prime Minister Skerrit warmly acknowledged the significance of the CBI programme as a key aspect of Dominica's post-disaster recovery after the devastating Hurricane Maria in 2017.

“We were able to continue generating revenues from the programme, literally 48 to 72 hours after the hurricane hit us. While all other aspects of our economy came to a halt.”

Recognising its pivotal role in saving the nation after Hurricane Maria, he affirmed the programme's enduring value as a catalyst for progress, prosperity, and sustainable development in Dominica.

He further reaffirmed Dominica's commitment as a nation to the core principles of the CBI programme. He highlighted the importance in providing opportunities for citizens to access both mobility and economic empowerment and the programme's role in fostering a sense of citizenship and belonging, beyond economic benefits.

“We understand the importance of the programme to many people, and to our country, but we want to ensure that the programme maintains its integrity.”

Acknowledging economic citizens, developers, and agents

During his visit, Prime Minister Skerrit engaged in productive discussions with key stakeholders in the industry, exploring opportunities for collaboration and growth.

In his address, Prime Minister Skerrit expressed his gratitude to the economic citizens, developers, and agents who have contributed to the strength and resilience of the Dominica CBI Programme.

He acknowledged their unwavering support and dedication, emphasising their pivotal role in shaping the programme's success.

“…you as agents and developers and promoters, you have one of the most sacred responsibilities where the programme is concerned. What you do can ensure the continued success of the programme, and that's why the programme has been successful.”

Marie-Therese Johnson, Director of the Citizenship by Investment Unit (CBIU), also highlighted the pivotal role that agents and developers play in guiding potential investors towards the possibilities that the Dominica CBI Programme offers.

“Your role as agents is not just about transactions; it is about shaping destinies, forging connections, and building bridges to a brighter tomorrow.”

Prime Minister Skerrit Emphasises Legal Compliance and Integrity in CBI Programme

In a resolute statement, Prime Minister Skerrit underscored the critical role of laws and regulations in governing the Citizenship by Investment (CBI) programme. He highlighted the authority vested in him by the Constitution and laws enacted by the Parliament, emphasising the importance of adherence to legal frameworks.

Prime Minister Skerrit emphasised the need for stakeholders and agents to familiarise themselves with and abide by existing laws.

Addressing a key concern, Prime Minister Skerrit reiterated that applicants must contribute the full amount as legislated in the regulations, emphasising that citizenship is not a commodity subject to sales promotions, emphasising the sanctity of citizenship as defined by the Constitution.

By emphasising compliance with regulations and laws, Prime Minister Skerrit reaffirmed the Government's commitment to ethical conduct in the programme.

Dominica Drives Responsible Investment Practices

At the core of the CBIU's operations is a dedication to transparency in every aspect of its processes.

From application procedures to due diligence protocols, the CBIU prioritises clear communication, thorough documentation, and adherence to regulatory guidelines.

By fostering a culture of openness, accessibility, and accountability, the CBIU aims to enhance the overall experience for stakeholders, providing clarity, guidance, and assurance throughout the citizenship acquisition journey.

As Prime Minister Skerrit concluded his visit to Dubai, he expressed optimism for the future of the Dominica CBI programme, reiterating his commitment to upholding the highest standards of excellence.

Through continued collaboration and partnership, Prime Minister Skerrit envisions a prosperous and sustainable future for Dominica and its stakeholders in the global citizenship landscape.
