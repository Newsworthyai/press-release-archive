# Union Jack Oil appoints industry expert to its board as US expansion gains momentum

--News Direct--

Union Jack Oil PLC (AIM:UJO, OTCQB:UJOGF) newly-appointed independent non-executive director Craig Howie shares his extensive background in the natural resources sector, notably oil and gas, which began with his role at KPMG corporate finance in Aberdeen during the early to mid-2000s.

In an interview with Proactive's Stephen Gunnion, Howie said the decision to join Union Jack Oil’s board stems from a long-standing relationship with the company and its executive chairman, David Brown Hill, which predates the company's flotation by Shore Capital in 2013.

As an independent non-executive director, Howie views his role as contributing strong financial and sector-specific expertise, particularly useful as he will serve as chairman of the audit committee.

He highlighted the company’s established operations, such as the Wressle field in North Lincolnshire, and discussed Union Jack Oil’s recent strategic moves, like the drilling at Andrews 1 well in the United States and the company's trading commencement on the OTCQB market.

These steps, according to Howie, are part of broader plans for aggressive expansion in the US, aiming to leverage new drilling opportunities and enhance investor awareness and liquidity in the company’s shares.
