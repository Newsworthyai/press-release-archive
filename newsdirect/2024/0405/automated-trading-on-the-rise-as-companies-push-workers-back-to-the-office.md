As the world gradually moves on from the shadow of the pandemic, the corporate drumbeat calling employees back to the office is growing louder. Leading the charge are companies like Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), alongside an overwhelming 90% of company leaders who are determined to enforce return-to-office policies by the end of 2024.

This shift, driven by concerns about productivity, collaboration and the intangible benefits of in-office work, signals a significant change for employees and traders who've grown accustomed to the flexibility of remote work.

Solutions For Traders Returning To The OfficeIf you’re a trader heading back to the office, there are still ways to stay active in the markets without compromising your professional responsibilities. Automated trading strategies are a possible solution, as they enable traders to engage with the markets throughout the day, despite limited screen time.

Swing trading also stands out as a time-friendly strategy for traders with busy daily schedules, allowing them to utilize after-hours planning to set market-on-open and market-on-close orders that can be filled while they’re away at work.

Both automated and swing trading strategies can accommodate the demands of a full-time job. Since futures trading involves the risk of loss, it should be noted automation can help minimize the emotional pitfalls of trading by leveraging algorithms. Such systems have fully automated alerts and executions, which dramatically reduces the need for market surveillance and enables a more balanced approach to work and trading. Markets won’t adjust to your work schedule, so automation is one way to manage risk and stay on top of trades while your attention is focused on work.
