While opioid dispensing rates in the U.S. are slowly ticking down, they remain elevated compared with rates in other countries. The U.S. makes up only 4.4% of the world’s population, but it consumes over 80% of the world’s opioids

Luckily, consumers today have more options than ever before for powerful, nonaddictive pain relief as they navigate their unique positions on the overall pain spectrum, including but not limited to over-the-counter (OTC) medications, physical therapy, medication and chiropractic care.

Mothers Against Prescription Drug Abuse (MAPDA) in partnership with Aleve®, a marquee pain relief product from Bayer indicated for minor pain, launched “The Painful Truth,” campaign developed to encourage consumers to explore, with their doctors, pain relief options such as OTC products before taking opioids, when appropriate.

“The Painful Truth” campaign launched with a film featuring real pain sufferers who are at crossroads in their pain relief journeys and seeking guidance. The featured patients believe they are participating in a video call with a pain expert who will help them explore their options, but as the conversation progresses, our “expert” reveals that they are in fact in recovery from opioid use disorder. At this critical juncture in their care, the patients are encouraged to consider different pain relief options.

A nationwide media tour was conducted on March 26th featuring Mary Bono, Co-Founder, Chair of the Board of Directors & CEO of Mother’s Against Drug Abuse (MAPDA) and Matt Robinson, A voice from “The Painful Truth” campaign and Co-Host of Till the Wheels Fall Off (TWFO) podcast.

Topics that were discussed included:

· What people need to know about the pain relief options available to them before taking opioids when appropriate and after discussion with their healthcare provider.

· Matt’s first-person experience with opioid use disorder.

· The work Mother’s Against Drug Abuse has done to address the issue.

· How patients can choose and advocate for themselves as it relates to pain management.
