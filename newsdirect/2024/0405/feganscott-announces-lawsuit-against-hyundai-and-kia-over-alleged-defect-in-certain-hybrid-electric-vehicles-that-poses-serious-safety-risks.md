# FeganScott Announces Lawsuit Against Hyundai and Kia Over Alleged Defect in Certain Hybrid-Electric Vehicles that Poses Serious Safety Risks

--News Direct--

FeganScott announces it has filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of Hyundai and Kia vehicle owners and lessees, claiming the automobile manufacturers sold thousands of hybrid-electric vehicles containing a defect that poses serious safety risks to drivers and passengers.

The lawsuit revolves around a defect in the engine clutch actuator (ECA), sometimes called the hydraulic clutch actuator. The vehicles named in the suit include 2017-2022 Kia Niro Hybrid, 2018-2022 Kia Niro Plug-In Hybrid, and 2017-2022 Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid vehicles.

According to the complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the defect allows fluid to leak into the engine clutch actuator, which can cause the car to stall and, in some reported instances, start a vehicle fire.

In July 2023, Kia issued a safety recall for certain Niro Hybrid vehicles due to the alleged ECA defect. However, the lawsuit states that the recall failed to fix the root cause of the defect, and that it does not prevent the risk of stalled vehicles. The suit also notes that Hyundai installed the same ECA component in its Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid vehicles and has not issued a safety recall.

“Hyundai and Kia have a long history of failing to issue timely and complete fixes for known defects in their vehicles, and this latest defect with the engine clutch actuator in certain hybrid-electric models is no different,” said FeganScott attorney Jonathan Lindenfeld. “Our firm has devoted significant time and resources to ensure that the largest automobile manufacturers in the world live up to their responsibilities. Consumers who spend tens of thousands of dollars for their vehicles deserve products that are safe and reliable.”

Drivers of the affected vehicles are encouraged to send their contact information to autosafety@feganscott.com to learn more about their rights.
