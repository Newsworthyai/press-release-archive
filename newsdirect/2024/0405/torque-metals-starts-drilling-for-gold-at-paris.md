# Torque Metals starts drilling for gold at Paris

--News Direct--

Torque Metals Ltd (ASX:TOR) managing director Cristian Moreno talks with Proactive’s Jonathan Jackson about drilling at the company’s Paris Gold Project in Western Australia, which aims to expand high-grade gold structures across several prospects. The 6,500-metre campaign is set to explore the Paris, Observation, HHH and Eva prospects, focusing on a 2.5 kilometres by 1 kilometre area influenced by the Boulder Lefroy System. This region exhibits potential for multiple deposits within a broader mineralised system, underpinned by parallel structures and splays. Moreno expressed confidence that this extensive drilling program will substantiate the gold endowment at Paris and help to transform it into a significant resource.
