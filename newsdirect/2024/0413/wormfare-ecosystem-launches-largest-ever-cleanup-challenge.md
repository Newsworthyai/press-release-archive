The centrepiece of the CleanUp initiative is the $100,000 Cleanup Challenge, inviting gamers and eco-warriors alike to participate in a global effort to clean and preserve the natural world. This challenge incentivises participation through crypto rewards and fosters a sense of community and collective responsibility towards the planet.
