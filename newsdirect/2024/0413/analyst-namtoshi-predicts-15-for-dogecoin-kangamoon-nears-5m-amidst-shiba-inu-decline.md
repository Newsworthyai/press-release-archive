The Dogecoin (DOGE) community is abuzz with excitement as crypto analyst Namtoshi predicts a potential surge to $15 for the legacy meme coin by 2024, mirroring its explosive rise in 2021. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) grapples with a 1,344% increase in token burn rate, sparking investor speculation about future price movements. In another development, KangaMoon (KANG) is attracting investors’ interest having crossed the $4.5 million presale funding milestone, alongside plans to integrate both SocialFi and GameFi into its unified ecosystement.

Dogecoin (DOGE) On the Rise Again? Namtoshi Predicts Potential Surge in 2024Dogecoin (DOGE) is rocketing back in popularity with crypto analyst Namtoshi putting out bullish projections for 2024. As the price of Dogecoin climbed from $0.01 to $0.76 in 2021, Namtoshi’s analysis suggests that a similar pattern probably would bring an incredible boom. In his words, “If this cycle acted the same, it would go from $0.20 to a whopping $15.20.”

Meanwhile, Dogecoin's growing mainstream appeal and active community could be its driving force for unprecedented adoption levels, propelling DOGE price to new heights. Notwithstanding the volatility in the crypto market, the thrilling opportunity to make life-changing profits tend to draw investors' attention towards Dogecoin again.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Burn Rate Skyrockets, Investors Eye Price MovementShiba Inu (SHIB) has just witnessed a jump in token burning activity with the burn rate rising to a spectacular 1,344%. This progression unfolds at a crucial time because the community is closely monitoring the price of SHIB which had been moving in unison with the overall market before stabilizing recently.

Despite the coin not doing well over the past month and recording a 20% decline and a modest 2% surge over the past week, analysts remain highly optimistic. Their bullish sentiment is based on the notion that the resistance level of $0.000031 is likely to gain strength, propelling a rise in the price sparked by the strong buying pressure observed in the past.

KangaMoon (KANG) Achieves Impressive $4.5 Million Presale MilestoneUnlike Dogecoin and Shiba Inu which are currently navigating market volatility, KangaMoon (KANG) is attracting investors with its outstanding presale results. To elaborate, the value of KangaMoon has gone up by 290% from an initial offering price of $0.005 to $0.0196 in the stage five of the ongoing presale campaign.

In addition, it has raised well above $4.5 million and expects to hit the $6 million funding milestone by the end of April. As a blockchain gaming network, KangaMoon plans to integrate both SocialFi, and GameFi’s P2E - play-to-earn element together leveraging a community-driven approach.

In this unified ecosystem dubbed “Kangaverse”, Players can customize and own KangaMoon avatars, participate in battle contests, or speculative bettings. By engaging in any of these, they get rewarded with KANG tokens or other high-value in-game collectibles for their winnings which can be traded in the dedicated marketplace later.

To further bolster trust and a community-driven platform, the active members of the community will be eligible to receive free KANG tokens before the project’s official launch. Particularly, users who sign up, and engage KangaMoon’s social media posts will be awarded free KANG coins.

Meanwhile, the global Play-to-Earn NFT Games Market is projected to expand at a rapid CAGR of 21.3% between 2022 and 2028, from over $15 billion.
