The crypto market is an avenue where investors' fortunes change positively and negatively depending on the tide of the crypto market. Ali Martinez, a crypto expert, believes Bitcoin will continue its bullish rally and hit $85,000 soon.

Meanwhile, KangaMoon and Pepe have been making waves in the crypto market, with KangaMoon tipped to outperform other memecoins in the market. Having given early investors substantial returns, the KANG token has been picked as one of the best new meme coins in the market.

KangaMoon (KANG) Early Investors Make 290% ROI, as New Buyers Will Get 10% BonusWhile Bitcoin and Pepe's prices continue to soar, KangaMoon remains one of the best new meme coins on investor's watch list. As a play 2 earn platform, every challenge on KangaMoon is a chance to win and every victory translates to real-world values and returns. Users can also earn more returns when they participate in community activities such as commenting and sharing posts aimed at promoting the project online.

While the presale started slowly, it has now peaked. The KANG price, which started at a floor price of $0.0050 in stage 1, is now sold for $0.0196 in stage 5, with early investors getting a 290% ROI. New buyers will get a 10% deposit bonus when they buy the token now. Meanwhile, KangaMoon has raised over $4.5M in the presale and could raise $6M before the end of April.

Moreover, KangaMoon has over 6000 token holders and 20k registered community members which makes the project the hottest meme coin for 2024. The team has also announced plans to list the token in a major tier 1 CEX exchange in Q2. As such, a surge to $0.5 is possible for KANG in Q2.

Based on the success of the presale, KangaMoon is tipped to outshine popular meme coins like Shiba Inu, Bonk, and Dogecoin in 2024. With analysts projecting 100x rallies in the coming months, now is the best time to buy the top meme coin and position yourself for massive future profits.
