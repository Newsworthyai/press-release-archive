# Decentralization and Its Impact on User Trust in DeFi

![](https://public.newsdirect.com/282847188/rEefqTUS.jpeg)

The FTX debacle in 2023 exacerbated an already deteriorating bear run in 2023, scaring off a large contingent of the market while showcasing the risks associated with asset decentralization. Though cryptocurrencies are inherently decentralized by nature, this is a double-edged sword, reflecting the challenge of ensuring security without centralized oversight.

Novel blockchains such as Toncoin aim to mitigate these risk factors and juggle security with decentralization in an effort to solve the crypto “trilemma.” While some present more viable solutions than others, the Elluminex team believes that Toncoin’s fundamentals and untapped potential make it the ideal foundation for an all-encompassing DeFi platform designed to foster user trust.

Toncoin: The Most Secure Layer-1 On The MarketA major focus of Toncoin is balancing the principles of decentralization with robust security measures to enhance user trust within the DeFi ecosystem. Toncoin’s architecture is designed to mitigate these challenges through innovative approaches that also align with the core tenets of decentralized finance.

Unlike alternative blockchains, Toncoin remains relatively untapped despite its rapidly growing infrastructure and capabilities. While Ethereum has established platforms like Uniswap and Binance Coin powers PancakeSwap, the TON blockchain is still in the infancy stage of DeFi development.

Elluminex is set to capitalize on this opportunity by building a comprehensive DeFi hub on TON, offering numerous features such as a DEX, staking, and cross-chain capabilities. About to become one of the first movers on this emerging network, Elluminex aims to leverage TON’s speed and scalability to attract new users in droves. Most importantly, Elluminex will utilize Toncoin in a way that maintains decentralization while fostering user trust in the space.

How Elluminex Utilizes Toncoin’s Capabilities To Foster User TrustDecentralization is at the forefront of Elluminex’s vision as it will leverage the TON blockchain to provide a secure all-in-one DeFi platform. Traditional finance relies on intermediaries like banks to manage transactions, which creates trust but isn’t necessarily foolproof and could be problematic. By removing intermediaries, Elluminex will give users direct control over their assets, ensuring transparency while building trust.

A key feature of Elluminex is its emphasis on self-custody, and users will maintain control over their private keys and assets on its native DEX. Unlike centralized exchanges where funds are managed by an outside party, Elluminex’s decentralized approach empowers users to manage their own crypto holdings. This autonomy aligns with the principle of “not your keys, not your crypto,” appealing to those who value independence from those who may not have the best intentions or lack trustability.

In addition, Elluminex will integrate various privacy-focused technologies supported by TON. By avoiding traditional identity verification processes like KYC’s that store sensitive data on centralized databases, Elluminex will guarantee 100% security pertaining to user information. This emphasis on privacy will provide peace of mind, enhancing trust among users while fostering a loyal user base.

But that isn’t all. Elluminex will utilize the TON blockchain in various other ways to propagate security, such as letting users verify publicly recorded transactions for full transparency. With automated smart contracts, Elluminex will ensure that all future transactions will be tamper-proof and don’t require third-party oversight, building user trust and reliability.

It’s also important to note that Elluminex will focus on educating users about security and decentralization to improve DeFi literacy. By providing essential knowledge on managing assets safely and understanding the risks and benefits of a decentralized system, Elluminex will empower users to make informed decisions and traverse the DeFi space with confidence.
