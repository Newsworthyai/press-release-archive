As communities from Florida to North Carolina work to rebuild after the devastation caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton, many families are confronting the overwhelming financial strain. With property damage, lost income, and unforeseen expenses piling up, residents are struggling to regain financial stability. Consolidated Credit, a nonprofit organization, is encouraging individuals to take proactive steps to safeguard their finances in the wake of these catastrophic events.

While the cost of basic hurricane preparations often runs into hundreds of dollars, the true economic impact is much more severe. Extended power outages, gas shortages, and extensive flooding have forced many businesses to shut down, resulting in lost wages and widespread financial challenges for millions.

“Credit cards can be a lifeline during emergencies, but for families already living paycheck to paycheck, these hurricanes can push them to the brink of financial ruin,” says Gary Herman, President of Consolidated Credit. “Not all the damage caused by hurricanes is visible. The financial fallout can linger long after the power is restored, and the debris is cleared.”

Consolidated Credit is offering free counseling services and guidance on how to manage debts and finances during this challenging time. Residents impacted by Hurricanes Helene and Milton can reach out for assistance at 1-844-331-7534. Certified counselors are available to help families create a recovery plan and avoid falling into deeper financial trouble caused by excessive debt.

“Many families without an emergency fund have had to rely on credit cards or other resources to cover the costs of preparations, evacuations, and repairs; this is often during a time of lost income,” Herman explains. “While credit can be a helpful tool, it’s crucial to monitor your budget closely and make a plan for paying down any debts accumulated during the storms.”

Consolidated Credit has provided the following tips for those struggling to recover financially after Hurricanes Helene and Milton:

* Consolidate High-Interest Debt: If you have high-interest credit card balances, consider transferring them to a card with a lower interest rate and focus on paying down the balance by covering at least the minimum payment plus the interest each month.
* Explore Debt Management Programs: Plans may be able to consolidate your debts into one low monthly payment, reduce or eliminate interest charges. Paying down debts this way should also improve your credit score over time.
* If You Lost Your Job, Seek Assistance: residents impacted by job loss due to the hurricanes can file for unemployment benefits through the Agency for Workforce Innovation by calling 1-800-204-2418.
* Start a Hurricane Fund: Once hurricane season ends, start putting aside a small amount, such as per pay period. By next year, you could have a solid emergency fund of over .

“We want to ensure that families have a financial recovery plan in place,” Herman says. “A natural disaster can wreak havoc on your budget, but with the right strategies, it doesn’t have to lead to long-term financial disaster.”
