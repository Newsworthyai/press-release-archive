# Carson Knuth Joins I-ON Digital Corp. to Help Drive Advanced Tokenization and Digital Asset Solutions

I-ON Digital Corp. (OTC: IONI) (“I-ON” or the “Company”), a market leader in gold and precious metals digitization and tokenization, as well as digital asset banking innovation, proudly welcomes Carson Knuth to its management team. A leader in blockchain-based product innovation and digital asset tokenization, Knuth’s expertise will help drive I-ON’s mission to revolutionize and transform real-world (RWA) asset digitization (in alignment with the Company’s primary emphasis on gold and precious metal tokenization). His addition further positions I-ON to set new compliance standards in digital product offerings and related service platform distribution, further elevating I-ON’s emerging status among first-tier regional banks and financial institutions.

With an extensive background in emergent blockchain technology, Knuth’s expertise in advanced tokenization frameworks will bring additional focus on bridging traditional financial services with the new efficiencies inherent in digital asset platforms. At I-ON, he will help lead the Company’s innovative approach to the digital economy, focusing on scalable tokenization strategies that enable secure, efficient, and regulatory-compliant transactions in the sale, transfer, and delivery of gold-backed digital securities through regulated digital asset exchanges, financial institution platforms, and digital banking ecosystems.

“I am thrilled to join I-ON at such a pivotal moment in the evolution of asset digitization and help further propel I-ON’s leadership in gold and precious metal tokenization,” said Knuth. “The Company’s bold vision and commitment to innovation in digital asset banking solutions align perfectly with the rapidly growing demand for transactional blockchain technology. Together, we intend to develop secure and scalable gateways for asset distribution and management and will work to establish new standards for the rapidly expanding digital marketplace.”

Knuth’s expertise adds material depth to I-ON’s groundbreaking gold-backed digital solutions, enhancing the impact of its cutting-edge Digital Banking Platform-as-a-Service (PasS) tailored for tier-1 banks and financial institutions. I-ON’s gold digitization platform redefines asset-backed securities by transforming verified in-situ gold reserves into digital securities without the need for invasive mining activities. This eco-conscious innovation not only safeguards environmental resources but also unlocks unprecedented liquidity channels, empowering investors and institutions to tap into new, sustainable and highly scalable financial ecosystems.

“We are pleased to welcome Carson to the I-ON team,” said I-ON CEO Carlos X. Montoya. “His exceptional expertise and notable achievements in digital assets and tokenization solutions align seamlessly with our strategic goals. Carson’s proven track record in driving value through innovative digital asset-based liquidity solutions and his extensive network within the financial institutions industry will open exciting new pathways for our asset tokenization initiatives. With his leadership, we are poised to elevate the market acceptance of our flagship digital security, ION.au, advancing our mission to make ION.au and our complimentary Platform-as-a-Service delivery channels more accessible and impactful.”

Montoya added, “The timing couldn’t be better, as our ION.au gold-backed digital asset, continues to gain traction with investors seeking the reliability of gold-backed assets absent the logistical challenges of physical gold ownership. We are uniquely positioned—validated through recent transactional achievements—to help investors diversify with a trusted digital asset. This is an exciting step forward as we continue to define how gold-backed securities are perceived and utilized in the modern financial landscape.”
