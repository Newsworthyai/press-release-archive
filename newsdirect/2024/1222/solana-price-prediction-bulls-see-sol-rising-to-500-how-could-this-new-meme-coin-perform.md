The latest bull market has been a real boom for Solana. After recently reaching its all-time high, it still has momentum. With likely upcoming regulatory changes, Solana could see a major influx of capital, propelling it even higher. In this context, tokens at the intersection of memes and DeFi will do well. In particular, one DeFi token, Cutoshi, is gaining major traction.

Can Solana Reach $500? Solana (SOL) has taken advantage of the bull market, and it likely won’t stop. After reaching an ATH of $263.83 in November, it stabilized at $233, which is still a multi-year high level. Moreover, several factors point to the rally continuing.

The crypto market rally came with the latest election. Notably, the more pro-crypto candidate, Donald Trump, won. What is more, crypto companies played an important role in the campaign, pouring billions toward electing pro-crypto candidates. This effort seems to be paying off already.

Solana is one of the projects that could benefit the most from this development. For one, Solana Labs is based in San Francisco, meaning that US regulations affect it more than other chains. On the other hand, altcoin is the likely next candidate for spot ETF approvals.

Solana spot ETFs have the potential to bring hundreds of millions in capital into Solana, significantly boosting its price. These facts are affecting investor sentiment and momentum, which is showing up in Solana’s technicals. Notably, Solana’s moving averages, which track its price momentum, indicate a strong buy. Moreover, the oscillators are neutral but not in overbought territory.

Due to fundamental factors and favorable technicals, analysts are bullish. Current predictions see Solana doubling in the coming months and testing the key psychological level of $500.

MemeFi Token Cutoshi Sees $1.37 M In InvestmentsAs investors are attracted by Solana’s DeFi ecosystem and strong meme coin activity, competitors are also getting a boost. One of them is the memeFi token Cutoshi (CUTO), which became viral after reaching a key milestone of $1.37 million in investments.

Cutoshi has raised more than $1.37 million in its presale. This indicates investor interest in projects at the intersection of memes and DeFi.

Cutoshi is both a meme coin and a DeFi utility token. As such, it features a multichain DEX, a learning platform, and a host of essential DeFi features. The entire ecosystem favors decentralization and hopes it can use memes to get more people to understand its benefits.

One of the key benefits is self-custody, which means that users on Cutoshi DEX retain full control over their assets. This boosts security and prevents fraud. With the crypto market currently focused on utility, projects that aim to bring more people into DeFi have significant potential. What is more, Cutoshi can also benefit from the potential meme coin virality factor.

If meme coin traders pick up on this cute token, it has the potential to supercharge its mission. In any case, Cutoshi’s presale revenue puts it in a good position to start building its ecosystem. Whether or not it succeeds in the long run will depend on its ability to convince users about the benefits of DeFi.
