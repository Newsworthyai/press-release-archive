# Peru is recognized as South America's Leading Destination at the World Travel Awards

Peru rose to the top in the regional edition of the World Travel Awards (WTA) 2024, after being chosen as "South America's Leading Destination". Likewise, for the seventh consecutive year since 2018, the country has been chosen as "South America's Leading Cultural Destination" These awards highlight the country's continuous effort to preserve and share its heritage and cultural diversity with the world.

The Historic Sanctuary of Machupicchu, in the Cusco region, has also been chosen for the seventh consecutive year as the "South America's Leading Tourist Attraction". It is worth noting that the Inca site is the first tourism destination to achieve carbon neutral international certification.

The country has also won the "South America’s Leading Culinary Destination" award, strengthening its position as the gastronomic epicenter of the region. In 2011, the Organization of American States (OAS) recognized Peruvian cuisine with the "Cultural Heritage of the Americas" award.

Since 2009, PROMPERÚ has been working constantly to promote its natural beauty, rich culture and outstanding gastronomy. These four awards consolidate Peru's position as a cultural and culinary reference at the regional level.

According to Claricia Tirado, Executive President of PROMPERÚ, Peru strives to set the highest possible bar to raise the standards of excellence in travel and tourism in the region.
