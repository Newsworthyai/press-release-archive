Understanding the Primary and Secondary MarketPrimary Market for Initial Offerings:The primary market is where initial property offerings are showcased at $10 per share, with a minimum investment of $100. This market allows investors to buy shares in newly listed properties directly from Realbricks. The primary market serves as the first step for properties entering the Realbricks ecosystem.

How the Primary Market Works:

* Listing Properties: Realbricks lists new properties on the primary market, providing detailed information for each property.
* Purchasing Shares: Investors can purchase shares in these properties for $10 each, with a minimum investment of $100, allowing them to gain exposure to real estate with a low initial investment.
* Funding Completion: Once a property is fully funded through the primary market, it becomes eligible to move to the secondary market.

Secondary Market:Realbricks is the first fractional real estate investing platform to feature a secondary market, enabling users to buy and sell shares at their convenience. This innovation adds a new dimension to fractional real estate investing, offering flexibility similar to an open stock trading system.

How the Secondary Market Works:

* Transition to Secondary Market: After a property is fully funded on the primary market, it moves to the secondary market for peer-to-peer trading after 30 days.
* Trading: Investors can trade shares, setting their own prices. Prices are determined by supply and demand.
* Flexibility: The secondary market allows investors to adjust their portfolios easily without long-term commitments.

The Realbricks Mobile App: Investing on the GoRecognizing the need for convenience in today’s fast-paced world, Realbricks has developed a mobile app that brings the full functionality of its platform to users’ fingertips. Available for both iPhone and Android users, the app ensures that investors can manage their portfolios anytime, anywhere.

4. Easy Buy/Sell Flow: The app offers a simple and intuitive process for buying and selling shares, making transactions quick and hassle-free.
