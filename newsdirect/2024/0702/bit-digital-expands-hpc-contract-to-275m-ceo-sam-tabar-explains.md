# Bit Digital expands HPC contract to $275M, CEO Sam Tabar explains

Bit Digital Inc (NASDAQ:BTBT) CEO Sam Tabar speaks to Proactive's Stephen Gunnion about the contract expansion with an existing high performance computing (HPC) customer, increasing the value to about $275 million. The market has positively responded to this news, significantly boosting the companyâ€™s shares last week.

Initially deploying 2,048 GPUs in January, the client has now doubled the size of the fleet, representing about $92 million per year, locked in for three years.

Tabar detailed that this computational power is essential for clients building large language models (LLMs) and AI applications. Bit Digital offers a customized approach, leveraging Nvidia H100 chips and collaborating with Dell and Supermicro for their deployments. This specialized equipment is hosted in data centers with unique capabilities, located in places like Iceland.

Looking ahead, Tabar emphasized the company's growing opportunities in the HPC AI vertical, citing a robust pipeline of clients eager for their services. "We have a very pregnant pipeline of opportunity... it's all been reverse inquiry," he noted. Bit Digital plans to streamline its processes by hiring a head of revenue to manage the increasing demand.
