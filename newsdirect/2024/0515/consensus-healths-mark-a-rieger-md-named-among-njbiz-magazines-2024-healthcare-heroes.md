--News Direct--

Consensus Health, a leading New Jersey-based healthcare organization with a physician-led medical group and an Independent Physician Alliance (IPA), announced today Mark A. Rieger, MD, senior partner physician, senior surgeon and medical group board member, was named a 2024 Healthcare Hero by NJBIZ Magazine, a leading business journal covering New Jersey.

The Healthcare Heroes Awards program was created to recognize excellence, promote innovation and honor the efforts of individuals and organizations making a significant impact on the quality of health care throughout New Jersey. Submissions are reviewed and winners chosen by a panel of independent judges. The 2024 program recognized individuals and organizations across 11 categories.

A pioneering pediatric orthopedic physician, Dr. Rieger is credited with many achievements that significantly impacted care – and continue to – for children across New Jersey. These accomplishments include, among others, introducing various, less invasive, diagnostic screening tools; creating physician groups led by acclaimed doctors; educating local healthcare professionals on specific diseases and care protocols; convincing local healthcare facilities to employ safer testing methods; and, holding leadership positions, all of which truly elevated pediatric orthopedic medical care statewide.

“This honor means more than words can ever express. What I have always strived to do is to improve the lives of children faced with orthopedic challenges and ensure their safety throughout their patient journeys. I have been committed to this endeavor for 35 years, and the recognition I now earned from NJBIZ through their Healthcare Heroes Awards program is indicative of my unwavering desire to positively impact pediatric orthopedic care across the state. I am grateful to the judges and the entire Consensus Health Medical Group team, and of course, my patients and their families. You all are the reason I remain committed to improving quality of care and realizing positive patient outcomes, day in and day out,” Dr. Rieger explained.

Michael Lovett, Consensus Health chief executive officer, commented: “Dr. Rieger and his unrelenting commitment to children throughout New Jersey has allowed Consensus Health Medical Group to truly stand out in the community. Patients from near and far travel to New Jersey to see Dr. Rieger and benefit from his distance expertise. We are privileged to have him as part of our group, and very proud of his accomplishments and contributions to the health of New Jersey children. From all of us at Consensus Health, we extend our sincerest congratulations to Dr. Rieger on this honor and thank him for his dedication to our patients.”

NJBIZ Healthcare Heroes honorees will be recognized during an in-person awards ceremony on Tuesday, June 25th, 8:00 AM – 10:30 AM at The Palace at Somerset Park. Accompanying the event will be a publication supplement highlighting their accomplishments. The supplement will be inserted into the July 8, 2024 issue of NJBIZ.
