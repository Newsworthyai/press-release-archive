--News Direct--

Ideal Power CEO Daniel Brdar joined Steve Darling from Proactive to provide an in-depth discussion on the company's advancements in manufacturing power semiconductors. These essential components play a critical role in a wide range of everyday devices, including home appliances and electric vehicles (EVs). Ideal Power has developed an innovative power semiconductor known as B-TRAN, which stands out due to its remarkably low energy losses. This technology significantly enhances efficiency across various applications, making it a game-changer in the industry.

One of the key benefits of B-TRAN is its ability to increase the range of electric vehicles, a crucial factor in the adoption of EV technology. Additionally, B-TRAN enhances the effectiveness of solar power systems in both residential and commercial settings, thereby promoting sustainable energy solutions. The semiconductor's bi-directional capabilities are particularly valuable for applications involving batteries, such as grid support systems and electric vehicles. This feature contributes to more cost-effective and efficient energy management, addressing one of the major challenges in the energy sector.

Ideal Power's primary customers are Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) that integrate these advanced semiconductors into a variety of products. These range from power converters used in energy storage systems to drivetrains in hybrid and electric vehicles. The company's innovative technology has recently undergone a rigorous test and evaluation program, which has been met with considerable success. This has led to commercial orders from several large, well-recognized companies, demonstrating the market's confidence in Ideal Power's solutions.

Moreover, Ideal Power has initiated a collaboration with Stellantis, one of the leading global automakers, to develop next-generation electric vehicle platforms. This partnership is expected to drive further advancements and adoption of Ideal Power's semiconductor technology in the automotive industry.
