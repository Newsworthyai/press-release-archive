--News Direct--

Delivra Health Brands CEO Gord Davey joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce the financial and operating results for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024. The company reported a total net revenue from continued operations of $8,792, reflecting a 36% increase compared to the same period last year, driven by higher sales of Dream Water in the US and Canada, along with increased sales of LivRelief.

Additionally, Davey told Proactive, Delivra saw a healthy rise in its gross profit margin, reaching 52%, up from 44% in the same period last year. This improvement contributed to positive Adjusted EBITDA, attributed to management's focus on customer mix, gross profit margin enhancement, and efficient administrative and selling support functions.
