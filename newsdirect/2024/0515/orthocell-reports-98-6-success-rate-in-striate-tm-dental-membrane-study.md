# Orthocell reports 98.6% success rate in Striate+™ dental membrane study

--News Direct--

Orthocell Ltd (ASX:OCC, OTC:ORHHF) CEO and managing director Paul Anderson joins Jonathan Jackson in the Proactive studio to talk through a 98.6% success rate in a post-market clinical study examining the effectiveness of its Striate+™ dental membrane in guided bone regeneration for dental implants. The Striate+™, a resorbable collagen membrane, has been validated through this study as a leading solution in bone and tissue regeneration, supporting Orthocell’s claim of its product being the best choice for such medical procedures. Anderson highlights the membrane's ability to enable high-quality bone and tissue repair, crucial for functional and aesthetically pleasing outcomes in patients. These results, indicating a notable level of bone formation and stability, were obtained from 99 patients, reinforcing the product's efficacy in real-world applications. Orthocell anticipates that the success of the Striate+™ will enhance its visibility among dental professionals and support BioHorizons, its exclusive global distributor, in increasing the product's market adoption. This development is particularly significant given the estimated annual market potential of more than US$700 million for the Striate+ product. The findings are scheduled for presentation at the European Association for Osseintegration (EAO) annual meeting in October 2024. The study also contributes to the clinical data needed for re-certification of EU market approval under the new European Medical Device Regulations (MDR), following an earlier Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) study.
