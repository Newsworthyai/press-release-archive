# RocketFuel Payment Solutions CEO Discusses Innovations in Digital Payments and Blockchain Technology

--News Direct--

RocketFuel Payment Solutions CEO Peter Jensen joined Steve Darling from Proactive to discuss the company's pioneering role in facilitating efficient money transfers. RocketFuel is dedicated to making transactions between individuals and businesses more streamlined and secure, focusing not only on the current market but also on the substantial unbanked population worldwide. Traditional electronic payment systems often suffer from inefficiencies, such as vulnerability to fraud and high costs associated with cross-border transactions. RocketFuel aims to address these issues by leveraging advanced modern technologies.

Jensen elaborated on how RocketFuel is optimizing these processes using blockchain technology. This innovative approach is particularly crucial given the global context: approximately 2 billion people worldwide are unbanked, struggling with digital payments due to a lack of access to conventional banking services. RocketFuelâ€™s blockchain-based solutions enable these individuals to participate in the digital economy, thereby promoting financial inclusion on an unprecedented scale.

The adoption of blockchain technology represents a significant shift in the financial landscape. Jensen highlighted the banking industry's concerns about this emerging market. As blockchain-based payments become more accessible, unbanked individuals might bypass traditional banking systems entirely. This scenario is reminiscent of how many people in developing countries leapfrogged the need for landline telephones by adopting mobile phones directly. While traditional banks offer a range of essential services, some basic functions, like payments, could be managed more efficiently through blockchain technology.

The potential impact of adopting blockchain technology for digital payments is substantial. Jensen pointed out that such adoption could reduce transaction costs by up to 75%, significantly enhancing overall productivity and economic growth. This reduction in costs can free up considerable resources that could be redirected towards other societal benefits, such as improving education and healthcare systems.
