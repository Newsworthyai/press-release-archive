# Direxion Unveils AIBU and AIBD: Leveraged & Inverse Trades on Artificial Intelligence and Big Data

--News Direct--

Direxion, a leading provider of tradeable and thematic ETFs, today announced the launch of the Direxion Daily AI and Big Data Bull 2X Shares (Ticker: AIBU) and the Direxion Daily AI and Big Data Bear 2X Shares (Ticker: AIBD). AIBU and AIBD seek to achieve 200%, or 200% of the inverse (opposite), before fees and expenses, respectively, of the daily performance of the Solactive US AI & Big Data Index.

The Index is designed to track the performance of companies deriving at least 50% of revenue in at least one of the following business fields: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data Analytics and Big Data, Natural Language Processing, and AI-Driven Services. AI and big data are inherently connected and dependent on each other, as AI requires large amounts of data to learn and develop. In 2023, the size of the global AI market was $207.9 billion. By 2030, this number is predicted to increase nearly tenfold to $1.8 trillion.

“AIBU and AIBD seek to capitalize on the relationship between AI and big data. We’re launching these ETFs at a pivotal time, as AI and its capabilities are now well established, but innovation is ongoing. Multiples for these companies are high, and sustaining valuations will be key, ” said Direxion Managing Director and Head of Sales and Alternatives, Edward Egilinsky. “These ETFs offer traders a chance to express short-term convictions in the AI-big data sector.”

All Direxion leveraged and inverse ETFs are intended only for investors with an in-depth understanding of the risks associated with seeking leveraged investment results, and who plan to actively monitor and manage their positions. There is no guarantee these ETFs will meet their objective. Please visit the Direxion Leveraged and Inverse ETF Education Center, where you will find educational brochures, videos, and a self-paced online course to help you understand if leveraged ETFs are right for you.
