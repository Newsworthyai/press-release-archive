# NAVEX Unveils Compliance Program Management: DOJ Guidance

--News Direct--

NAVEX, the global leader in integrated risk and compliance management software, announces the release of NAVEX Compliance Program Management: DOJ Guidance. This news comes on the heels of NAVEX’s recent addition of global whistleblowing rules and regulations to the Compliance Program Management solution. Compliance professionals can now navigate corporate governance regulations by mapping their current program to the latest Department of Justice (DOJ) guidelines, pinpointing weaknesses in minutes.

A NAVEX survey found that nearly 44% of companies reported at least one regulatory investigation or enforcement action in the past two years. NAVEX Compliance Program Management: DOJ Guidance helps compliance professionals gain instant insights into gaps and vulnerabilities, ensuring their program meets DOJ expectations and minimizes their risk of legal penalties.

“Compliance teams today struggle to identify areas of focus, particularly within DOJ guidance,” says Jazz Mimoun, global ethics program director at onsemi. “NAVEX Compliance Program Management: DOJ Guidance can be a useful tool to identify those areas and conduct internal analyses and risk assessments that actively improve a compliance program more effectively.”

The solution translates DOJ guidance on corporate compliance into straightforward control recommendations backed by input from industry experts and GRC industry leaders. It removes the frustration of keeping pace with evolving regulations and offers a clear roadmap to:

1. Clarify compliance with expert input: Translate open-ended compliance guidelines from the DOJ to clear-cut compliance statements vetted by legal experts. Score statements to quantify program performance and identify gaps and shortfalls.
2. Demonstrate program value: Organize and score all GRC programs in a single web-based platform. Prove program value and effectiveness with digestible dashboards and board-ready reports.
3. Stay audit ready: A single source of truth for collecting, organizing and accessing evidence of compliance activities and program structure, making it easier and more cost-effective to stay audit ready.
4. Reduce unseen compliance risk: A program designed with industry-proven structures is the best defense against unknown or unwanted risks. Design and deploy a GRC program to effectively predict, manage, and mitigate those risks.

"Companies are facing a lot of challenges that go beyond regulatory compliance. They're dealing with resource constraints, technology integrations, cross-departmental collaboration and more,” says NAVEX Chief Product Officer, A.G. Lambert. "NAVEX Compliance Program Management: DOJ Guidance will immediately help compliance professionals navigate many of these challenges upfront."
