# European Green Transition encouraged by channel sampling at Olserum's Djupedal prospect

--News Direct--

European Green Transition PLC CEO Aiden Lavelle joined Proactive's Stephen Gunnion with results from channel sampling at the Djupedal prospect at the Olserum Rare Earth Elements (REE) project in south Sweden.

Lavelle highlighted significant channel and grab sampling results at Djupedal, which revealed a large, mineralised zone extending over one meter. These findings suggest a system size surpassing the known resource area, positioned about 2.5 km from the main site. The samples indicated high-grade mineral structures, with certain areas showing mineralisation levels above 1.5% and 2%.

Lavelle also mentioned the discovery of a new mineralized shear zone approximately 900 meters south of the primary site, which promises further exploration opportunities.

He outlined the next steps for the project, which involve drilling these newly identified targets in the latter half of the year to confirm mineralisation at depth and potentially attract partnerships for further development.

Lavelle expressed optimism about scaling the project, viewing the recent findings as a solid basis for securing future partnerships and advancing commercialisation efforts.
