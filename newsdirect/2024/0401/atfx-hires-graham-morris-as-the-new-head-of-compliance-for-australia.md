Sydney, April 01, 2024 – (500NewsWire) — ATFX recently announced that Graham Morris has been appointed as Head of Compliance for ATFX’s operations in Australia. Graham is set to bring a vast reservoir of compliance expertise and industry knowledge to the firm, which will be instrumental in enhancing ATFX’s regulatory frameworks and overseeing compliance matters within the Australian financial market.
