New York, April 1st, 2024 - (PlatoAi via 500NewsWire) -- Back in 1960 when Alan Arthur penned "April 1st Bermuda Shorts Day" on a campus announcement board, he started a new tradition. This simple act ignited a tradition, marking the final day of the winter semester with a festive celebration. Over time, it evolved into a cherished annual event, bringing the campus community together in joyous camaraderie.

But what about all the others who can not join the party on the campus?

A fun project was sparked with this comment to take BSD into Web3 as NFTs!
