In the niche of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), Iteris Inc. (NASDAQ: ITI) is a technology company leading the charge in the sector’s innovation, which is proving more and more essential for the world’s rapidly expanding urban landscapes. As cities grow and transportation demands increase, the importance of advanced ITS solutions and its innovators has never been more critical.

Through its ClearMobility® Platform which includes advanced cloud-enabled software, AI-powered sensors, data analytics and consulting and services capabilities, the company is enabling a connected transportation network that unlocks new levels of safety, efficiency and sustainability for the sector. As the primary contractor for the U.S. Department of Transportation's (USDOT) ITS initiatives, Iteris is also a key player in developing state-of-the-art ITS architectures that support the promise of more connected transportation networks. But how exactly can the company’s expertise in ITS architecture pave the way for a more efficient and future-ready transportation network?

Iteris' ITS Architecture CapabilitiesAs a complement to its broad set of solutions, Iteris has been the main contractor for a USDOT project focused on improving and standardizing intelligent transportation systems (ITS) for over 20 years. This project includes enhancing the national ITS plan, providing training and incorporating new technologies and methods as ITS evolves. This partnership underscores the company’s critical role in developing the ITS architecture standards for the government and the company’s thought leadership position in the ITS industry.

Over the years, Iteris has received more than $92 million to help expand and refine this system, which plays a crucial role in modernizing transportation through better computing and communication technologies. Iteris also helps federal, state and local agencies understand and apply the national ITS guidelines to their own projects, offering tools and support to develop regional and specific ITS plans. For example, USDOT recently expanded the scope of Iteris’ work on the nation’s ITS architecture to incorporate new infrastructure requirements for vehicle electrification. In addition to developing and maintaining the national ITS plan, Iteris offers support through software tools, training and documentation to ensure these agencies meet national ITS standards and can effectively integrate new services and technologies into their transportation systems.

Implementing ITS Solutions In The US And Around The WorldAt its core, Iteris is a technology company that offers a wide range of solutions for transportation infrastructure through its AI-powered ClearMobility Platform, including a state-of-the-art transportation analytics software known as ClearGuide. Through its work with the Federal Government, it also provides extensive support for the deployment of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), including workshops aimed at educating stakeholders on managing their regional ITS infrastructures, and plays a critical role in the dissemination of ITS expertise through the industry.

The company plays a crucial role in the ongoing development and updating of the National ITS Architecture (also known as ARC-IT), ensuring it incorporates the latest in connected and automated vehicle technologies. With a track record of training over 4,000 professionals through its presentations and workshops, Iteris actively contributes to setting ITS standards both domestically and internationally.

Additionally, Iteris has guided more than 60 regions in creating their initial ITS architectures during intensive three-day sessions. Beyond these workshops, Iteris has supported over 50 state, regional and local agencies and international and private-sector enterprises in applying its ITS architecture expertise to related initiatives. For example, Iteris recently announced that it is developing ITS architecture plans for Cebu, Philippines and Toyota, North America. The critical work performed by Iteris helps to maximize the benefits for ITS investments, enhances ITS project implementation and fosters greater integration of ITS solutions across various transportation environments.

Future Transportation NetworksThrough Iteris' contribution to ITS architecture and design with the USDOT, it is at the forefront of the industry’s demands and innovations, shaping the future of transportation networks. By leading the design and deployment of industry best practices and through the implementation of its own portfolio of technology solutions, Iteris is responding to the current needs of urban mobility and anticipating the future demands of transportation. In that context, the impact of ITS on future transportation networks is profound, promising shorter travel times, reduced congestion and a significant advancement toward safer, more sustainable urban environments. With its comprehensive approach to ITS architecture and its commitment to ongoing research and development, Iteris is at the forefront of this transformation that could dramatically improve our roadways now and in the future.
