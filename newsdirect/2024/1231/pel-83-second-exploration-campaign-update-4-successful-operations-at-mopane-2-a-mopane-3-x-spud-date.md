# PEL 83 Second Exploration Campaign – Update 4
Successful Operations at Mopane 2-A & Mopane 3-X Spud Date

Custos Energy (Pty) Ltd. (“Custos” or the “Company”) is pleased to provide the following further update regarding the second exploration and appraisal campaign on blocks 2813A and 2814B located in the heart of Namibia’s Orange Basin, emerging as the one of the world’s most prospective oil and gas regions. The blocks are governed by Petroleum Exploration License 83 (“PEL 83”) which is operated by a subsidiary of Galp Energia (“Galp”) of Portugal. Custos is a 10% working interest owner in PEL 83 as is NAMCOR, the National Petroleum Corporation of Namibia.

We are pleased to announce that thePEL 83 Joint Venture partners have successfully drilled and logged the Mopane-2A well (Well #4) on PEL83 which was spud on December 2nd. Mopane-2A found a hydrocarbon column of gas-condensate in AVO-3 with a thin net pay in the reservoir sweet spot.

The well also discovered a hydrocarbon column of light oil in a smaller reservoir, AVO-4.

Both reservoirs showed good quality sands, with good porosities and permeabilities, high pressures and low fluid viscosity characteristics, with minimum CO2 and no H2S concentrations. Also, in line with all previous Mopane wells, no water contacts were found.

Galp and its partners will continue to analyze and integrate all of the newly acquired data to allow a better understanding of the Mopane complex, which will support the continuing assessment of the commerciality of the discoveries.

As part of the ongoing E&A campaign in the wider Mopane area, the drillship is now moving to the Mopane-3X exploration well location (Well #5), targeting two stacked prospects AVO-10 & AVO-13 with expected spud date around January 1st, 2025.

In parallel, the JV is carrying out a high-density and high-resolution proprietary 3D development seismic campaign over the Mopane complex.”

"The continuing success of the second campaign at Mopane including this second successful appraisal and immediate move to the 3-X exploration location is further evidence of the quality and potential of the Mopane complex. The exploration and appraisal activities anticipated over coming months should further unveil its world class scale and quality.” said Knowledge Katti, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Custos. “We are uniquely positioned at the heart of this emerging hydrocarbon province.” he added.
