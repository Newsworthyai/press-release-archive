# Kevel partners with the World’s Largest Home Improvement Retailer to in-house its retail media technology for Orange Apron Media

Both Kevel and Orange Apron Media share a common goal: advertising partner success. They understand that having a tangible impact on their partners’ businesses and success transcends traditional revenue goals and emphasizes a symbiotic relationship where growth is intrinsically tied to the prosperity of their clients. While the partnership between Kevel and Orange Apron Media has just officially launched, it promises to continue to bring innovation to the retail media landscape.

Kevel, the API-first ad serving company, is formally announcing its partnership with The Home Depot to support its in-house transformation of its retail media network’s, Orange Apron Media Technology. After six years of providing home improvement retail media solutions, Orange Apron Media embarked on a new journey of transformation and innovation. The Orange Apron Media team will rely on Kevel's Retail Media Cloud™ to power its in-house journey as the company continues to transform and innovate its services.

As the home improvement retailer looked to lean further into their competitive edge as a specialty retailer, continuing to innovate their retail media offerings and capabilities for advertisers, they knew flexibility and innovation would be vital. Orange Apron Media turned to Kevel’s flexible, API-based Retail Media CloudTMsolution to power its in-house retail media technology. With the addition of Kevel’s Retail Media CloudTM, Orange Apron Media built a differentiated retail media network and added value to its ad products by enabling advertisers to connect with customers closer to the point of purchase.

Working closely with the Kevel team to upgrade its in-house retail media technology, the Orange Apron Media team will continue to double down on its goal to provide advertisers with value and performance. Through this collaboration Orange Apron Media and Kevel will continue to seamlessly integrate retail media offerings into its digital strategies, emphasizing enhancements to the customer experience across both owned and off-site channels through storytelling and personalization leveraging unique first-party data.

“Providing the best possible service and experience for our customers and our advertising partners is at the top of our list of priorities,” said Melanie Babcock, vice president of Orange Apron Media and Monetization. “Finding like-minded partners, like Kevel, makes it easier to build custom solutions that help brands connect with customers at the right place and at the right time. When customization is done right, it enhances everyone’s experience.”

Both Kevel and Orange Apron Media are dedicated to enhancing their solutions through innovation and continue to stay at the forefront of the constantly evolving digital advertising landscape, making the partnership an excellent fit at a pivotal time in the industry. Kevel continues to stand out amongst ad tech solution providers as the only API-based solution for in-housing retail media technology, allowing retailers to differentiate based on their unique brand and first-party data. Orange Apron Media is forging the path for specialty retailers by developing an enhanced omnichannel customer experience through ads that tell a story across the customer journey, ensuring their advertisers receive at least two-times return on their ad spend.

“There has been a large shift in the retail media landscape as brands focus on the retail media networks that deliver real value versus those that are commoditized and not fit for purpose. This is pushing retailers to move from off the shelf solutions to build high-end, differentiated retail media networks,” says James Avery, Founder & CEO Kevel. “Kevel’s flexible API-based Retail Media Cloud was designed specifically to enable retailers like Orange Apron to build customized in-house retail media solutions in a way that really differentiates them, leveraging their unique attributes to provide advertisers with innovative, cutting edge decisioning, ad formats, targeting, and site performance, all while keeping their data safe and secure at scale.”
