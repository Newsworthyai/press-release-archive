The digital marketing agency has set a new standard in the industry by consistently delivering an astounding volume of high-quality, manually created content that significantly boosts clients' search engine rankings and key performance metrics.

In the digital realm, content is often likened to currency. If that's the case, Search Berg's clients find themselves with coffers overflowing. The agency's approach to content creation is akin to a master artisan's workshop, where quality and craftsmanship reign supreme. It wouldn't be uncommon to see an average SEO client get 200+ content assets on various platforms over the course of a year. This substantial output isn't driven by quotas, but rather stems from the company's commitment to comprehensive, value-driven strategies.

"While we've observed websites ranking with AI-generated content, the longevity, connection, and engagement tell a different story," says Aaron Tyler, Chief SEO Strategist at Search Berg. "Our human-first approach ensures that each piece of content resonates with the target audience, fostering genuine engagement and lasting results."

The company's strategy challenges the growing trend of AI-dependent content creation in the digital marketing industry. By prioritizing human creativity and expertise, Search Berg has consistently delivered content that not only ranks well but also creates meaningful connections with readers.

Key highlights of Search Berg's content marketing approach include:

1. Volume with Quality: A rich tapestry of content, naturally woven throughout the year
