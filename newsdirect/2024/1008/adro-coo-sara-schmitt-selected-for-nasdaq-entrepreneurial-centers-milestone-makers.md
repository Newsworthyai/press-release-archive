The Milestone Makers program supports selected founders who are building companies aligned with the United Nations’ 17 sustainable development goals.

The program culminates in a graduation ceremony held at Times Square in New York City, where participants will be featured on the Nasdaq building.

“It’s such an honor to have this opportunity to learn and work alongside other early and mid-stage founders that are focused on scaling their companies. The Nasdaq network has incredible reach, and the depth of their experience is invaluable in guiding founders to become better leaders,” said Sara Schmitt.

Sara Schmitt brings a wealth of experience to Adro. Born and raised in Buffalo, she spent nearly a decade working at Epic before earning her MBA from Cornell University. She later worked at Amazon before leaving to co-found Adro with Amarildo Gjondrekaj and Kevin DeArmond. In addition to her role at Adro, Sara currently teaches at several universities in the New York area.

Adro recently announced the launch of its no-fee checking, savings, and credit card products for internationals moving to the US, furthering its mission to provide financial access and support to those transitioning to life in America.
