AuditSoft, Canada's leading provider of safety and compliance auditing software, is excited to announce the expansion of its partnership with the Infrastructure Health & Safety Association (IHSA). IHSA will adopt AuditSoft’s advanced audit software as the exclusive platform for conducting the IHSA’s National Construction Safety Officer (NCSO®) exam audits.

The NCSO® program is a critical certification for health and safety professionals in the construction industry across Canada. As part of this partnership, IHSA is equipping both seasoned and aspiring health and safety professionals with access to sophisticated audit tools. Students pursuing the NCSO® designation will exclusively use AuditSoft’s audit software for their exam submissions, ensuring they are well-prepared to meet real-world safety auditing demands.

This positions IHSA and AuditSoft at the forefront of shaping the next generation of health and safety professionals to excel in an industry that increasingly relies on technology for auditing efficiency, accuracy, and data insights.

Key Benefits of the Partnership:

* Introduction to Industry-Standard Tools: Students and professionals in Ontario’s construction safety sector will gain hands-on experience with AuditSoft’s digital audit tool, giving them practical exposure to industry-standard software.
* Improved Audit Process: The use of AuditSoft’s software will streamline the submission and review of exam audits, ensuring a more efficient and accurate evaluation process resulting in faster certification.
* Enhanced Exam Experience: The integration of a trusted and widely used audit tool will provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for IHSA NCSO® candidates.

“We are excited to be bringing the AuditSoft audit tool to our NCSO® program,” said Jennifer McKenzie, Director, Stakeholder & Client Engagement at IHSA. "AuditSoft was rolled out to support IHSA’s Certificate of Recognition (COR®) program in 2023 and we’re confident the tool will bring similar benefits here, whilst ensuring our students are equipped with the latest technology to succeed in their careers."

"We’re thrilled to deepen our collaboration with IHSA and bring our advanced audit tool to the NCSO® program," said Peter Spence, VP of Partnerships at AuditSoft. “This initiative will streamline the exam process and help develop the future workforce by familiarizing them with the tools they’ll need as they work to raise safety standards in the construction industry."
