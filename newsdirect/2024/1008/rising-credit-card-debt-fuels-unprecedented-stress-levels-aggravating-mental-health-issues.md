# Rising Credit Card Debt Fuels Unprecedented Stress Levels, Aggravating Mental Health Issues

Over the past three years, an increasing number of Americans report heightened stress linked to credit card usage, leading to deeper debt and worsening mental health.

In observance of Mental Health Awareness Month, Debt.com conducts an annual survey each May to examine the intersection of mental health and financial stress.

The findings underscore a clear correlation: more debt results in more stress.

“It’s the dictionary definition of a vicious cycle,” says Debt.com chairman and CPA Howard Dvorkin. “You fall behind on your bills, so you distract yourself with dinner out or some shopping therapy. Of course, that adds to your debt, which adds to your stress, which depletes your mental health. And our research shows it’s getting worse every year.”

In 2022, 1 in 5 survey respondents reported feeling stressed after using their credit cards. The 2024 survey reveals there has been a 17% increase over the past three years, raising that number to 4 in 10. Gen Z is most likely (47%) to feel stressed after using credit cards.

Nearly half (47%) say they take on more debt when they are feeling stressed. Debt.com’s research shows a breakdown of those taking on more debt when they are feeling stressed:

* 67% of Gen X take on more debt when stressed
* 40% of Millennials take on more debt when stressed
* 37% of Gen Z take on more debt when stressed

Over half (51%) feel stressed when reviewing their credit card bills, while:

* 10% feel hopeless
* 8% feel sad
* 4% experience a loss of sleep
* 3% experience a loss of appetite
* 3% experience lower self-esteem

The research also shows that 26% say they argue with their significant other over credit card spending:

* 45% are Gen X
* 16% are Millennials
* 16% are Gen Z
* 7% are Baby Boomers

The convenience of credit cards can negatively impact mental health, according to 76% of survey respondents. More than 1 in 4 have accrued at least $10,000 in credit card debt because they were feeling down or stressed out.

Further, the research shows that the Middle Atlantic region of the country is feeling the most (31%) stress and mental strain from credit card debt.

“The generational and regional data remind us of something important,” Dvorkin says. “Debt isn’t equally distributed in this country – but the stress is. So, it doesn’t matter if you’re a 25-year-old struggling with student loans or a 50-year-old who’s fallen behind on their credit cards. Those individuals might have nothing else in common – except for how terrible they’re feeling about their finances.”
