For over a decade, Genevieve served in many executive leadership roles at Angostura Holdings Ltd, the world's largest cocktail bitters producer, including being the company’s first female CEO. While at Angostura Holdings Ltd, Genevieve directed the commercial team that re-engineered the distribution model for Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australia and marketed Angostura's international brands, including Angostura Aromatic Bitters. In addition to her role as CEO, Genevieve continued to lead the brand-building team and developed strategic brand re-positioning tools that enabled international growth in the beverage alcohol industry.
