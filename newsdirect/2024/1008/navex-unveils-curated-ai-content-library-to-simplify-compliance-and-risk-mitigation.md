# NAVEX Unveils Curated AI Content Library to Simplify Compliance and Risk Mitigation

NAVEX, the global leader in integrated risk and compliance management software, introduces its new AI-focused content library designed to help organizations address the rapidly evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI) regulations and frameworks.

As AI technologies become part of daily operations, many organizations find themselves entering uncharted waters regarding effective AI governance. According to Forrester’s September 2023 Artificial Intelligence Pulse Survey, 56% of AI decision-makers said their organization will use generative AI (genAI) in the next 12 months for internal or customer-facing production applications for employee productivity.

The stakes are rising, and navigating these challenges without a clear framework can feel overwhelming, leaving companies vulnerable to risks. NAVEX plays a critical role by enabling companies to implement strong controls, automate workflows, and perform comprehensive testing. This approach simplifies complex challenges and transforms them into strategic opportunities.

NAVEX’s content library is continuously curated to cover international and industry-specific AI regulations, including emerging standards and compliance requirements. By leveraging this resource, customers can ensure their AI initiatives align with ethical guidelines and regulatory mandates.

A.G. Lambert, Chief Product Officer at NAVEX, captures the pivotal moment many organizations face: "As AI technologies revolutionize industries, companies find themselves standing at a crossroads, navigating the intricate landscape of effective AI governance. Our AI content not only empowers risk management professionals to establish crucial controls but also enhances efficiency by automating compliance processes. This dual approach enables organizations to embrace AI technology with confidence, transforming challenges into opportunities for growth and innovation."

Key features of the NAVEX AI content library include:

* Centralized AI Regulatory Resources: Access a consolidated library of global AI regulations and industry-specific guidelines.
* Streamlined Control Development: Simplify the process of creating and implementing AI-specific controls to align with emerging regulations.
