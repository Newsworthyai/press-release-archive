The perception that the most lucrative investment opportunities are reserved for the ultra-wealthy seems to be changing quickly. With growing interest in alternative investments, traditional assets are no longer the only way to build a diversified portfolio.

Thanks to platforms like Arta Finance, investments in private equity, venture capital, private credit and real estate are now within reach of everyday investors.

The Growing Appeal Of AlternativesPreviously considered to be largely for institutional investors and billionaires due to a mostly high initial investment minimum, alternative investments are increasingly catching the eye of the broader investing public. Alternatives can be any asset class that doesn’t belong to a publicly traded or publicly available traditional asset class like stocks, bonds or mutual funds. Examples of alternatives range from private equity and venture capital to real estate, commodities, cryptocurrencies and fine art, just to name a few.

While there is a wide variety of alternative investments, one thing most of them have in common is that they typically offer returns that are less correlated to the stock market than traditional public investments, and can therefore be a way to hedge against market volatility.

Many alternative investments, such as real estate and commodities, also tend to rise with inflation, which can help you preserve your purchasing power when the cost of living rises.

Alternatives are particularly popular among younger investors. A study published in June by the Bank of America Private Bank found that Gen Z and Millennials are increasingly interested in diversifying their portfolios beyond stocks and bonds. This generational shift suggests that investors no longer consider traditional investments to be enough. Alternatives offer a potential counterbalance to the volatility of today’s market while offering the potential for steady and high returns.

There are many benefits to investing in alternatives, but investing in them has typically been difficult for the majority of investors due to factors like a high required initial investment of $1 million or more, net worth of more than $5 million, long periods of illiquidity and limited transparency. This is where Arta Finance, with its focus on private investing, can help.

Arta Finance: Opening The Door To AlternativesArta Finance is on a mission to bring sophisticated wealth management strategies to a broader audience. Founded by an octet of former Google employees, including CEO Caesar Sengupta, Arta’s mission is to bring a blend of private banking and family office-style investing to the masses by allowing clients to invest in private equity, venture capital, private credit and real estate opportunities, among others, and the company says it offers access to exclusive financial strategies.

The platform goes beyond just offering private investments. Arta also provides public market assets such as stocks, bonds, ETFs and derivatives. With the combination of traditional and alternative assets, investors can build diversified and resilient portfolios designed to manage market volatility. `

Why Now Could Be The Right Time To Explore Private InvestingRising inflation, volatile markets and geopolitical instability have made many traditional investment strategies less predictable. Alternatives, like private funds, offer diversification, the potential for higher returns and a hedge against market fluctuations. Platforms like Arta Finance are making these highly sought-after assets available to ten times the amount of Americans who used to enjoy exclusive access. This is, enabling everyday investors to diversify their portfolios in ways that were previously impossible.
