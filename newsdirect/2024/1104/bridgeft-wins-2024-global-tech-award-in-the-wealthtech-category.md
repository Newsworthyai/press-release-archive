# BridgeFT Wins 2024 Global Tech Award in the WealthTech Category

BridgeFT, a cloud-native, API-first wealth infrastructure software company that enables financial institutions, fintech innovators, and registered investment advisors to deliver better, data-driven outcomes for their clients, announced today that it has been named a winner of the 2024 Global Tech Awards in the WealthTech category.

BridgeFT’s distinction as the only winner in the WealthTech category is a testament to its commitment to accelerating, simplifying and reducing the cost of wealth management application development and maintenance, which empowers clients to focus on their differentiators.

The Global Tech Awards recognizes outstanding achievements of tech organizations and professionals who are making an impact worldwide by creating and delivering innovative technologies that drive progress and shape the future of technology. The 2024 award program highlights 200 winners, including organizations and individuals, across 106 categories, evaluating entries based on four criteria: design, impact, creativity, and ease of use.

“We are honored to receive the 2024 Global Tech Award alongside companies and individuals pushing the boundaries of innovation across numerous industries,” said BridgeFT Chief Executive Officer Joe Stensland. “At BridgeFT, we remain committed to being a true technology enabler for our clients, making it easier for them to gain access to critical total wealth data⸺whether from custodians, back offices, alternatives or held-away assets⸺to further enable differentiation and accelerate growth. This award serves as further validation that our modern, API-first WealthTech-as-a-Service platform is having an impact on the wealth management industry.”
