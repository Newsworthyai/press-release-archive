# Market Alert: New Report Highlights Steakholder Foods Major Shift to Commercialization & Revenue Generation

A new report by PESG Research highlights Steakholder Foods’ (NASDAQ: STKH) transformative journey from research and development to commercialization in the alternative protein and 3D food printing sectors. The report highlights how 2024 marked a pivotal year for the company, with strategic partnerships fueling revenue generation and positioning Steakholder Foods for potential growth in a booming market.

Strategic Partnerships Lay Foundation for Revenue GrowthSteakholder Foods secured multiple strategic agreements in 2024 that validate its proprietary technology and solidify its commercial potential. Key partnerships include a commercial memorandum of understanding with Wyler Farm, which involves the purchase of Steakholder Foods’ MX200 meat printer and SH™-Beef premix blends. This agreement also encompasses royalties and raw materials supply, enabling large-scale production of alternative proteins.

Additional partnerships with the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in Taiwan and regional collaborations in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) highlight the company’s international reach. The GCC partnership, aimed at supporting local food security initiatives, involves constructing a pilot facility for hybrid-cultivated fish production and showcases Steakholder Foods’ scalability in new markets. These agreements are seen as significant steps toward establishing long-term, recurring revenue streams.

Initial Purchase Orders Signal Commercial ViabilityAccording to the company, initial purchase orders from key partners such as Bondor Foods and Wyler Farm have initiated revenue streams, providing critical proof of concept for Steakholder Foods’ business model. In September 2024, Bondor Foods placed its first order for plant-based premixes for white fish and salmon patties, followed by Wyler Farm’s order for SH™-Beef premix for a new line of plant-based meat products. These initial revenues underscore the company’s successful transition from R&D to commercialization.

Moreover, in a bid to attract new clients and partners, Steakholder Foods inaugurated a state-of-the-art Demonstration Center in Israel. The facility showcases live demonstrations of its MX200 and HD144 3D printers, highlighting their capabilities in real-time production of plant-based meat and seafood alternatives. This hands-on experience allows potential partners to witness the full production process, reinforcing the quality and versatility of Steakholder Foods’ offerings.

Positioned for Potential Growth in Expanding MarketsThe PESG report places Steakholder Foods within the context of a rapidly expanding alternative protein market, projected to grow from $76.3 billion in 2023 to $423 billion by 2033. This growth is driven by consumer interest in sustainable and health-conscious food options. Additionally, the 3D food printing market is expected to surge, with estimates forecasting growth from USD 34.7 million in 2019 to USD 1,015.4 million by 2027, driven by advances in technology and consumer demand for innovative food solutions.

The report highlights how Steakholder Foods’ advancements potentially align with these industry trends, positioning the company as a potential leader in sustainable food production. Its proprietary 3D printing technology and strategic partnerships are poised to capture a share of this growing demand, particularly as cost management initiatives and recurring revenues take effect.

Outlook and Future ProspectsWith strategic partnerships maturing and a demonstration center enhancing its market presence, Steakholder Foods appears poised for potential revenue growth in the coming years. The company has noted that it is in advanced discussions for a high-impact international agreement expected to close by early 2025. This move could further bolster Steakholder Foods’ position as a leader in the alternative protein sector, which continues to gain momentum amid shifting consumer preferences and sustainability goals.
