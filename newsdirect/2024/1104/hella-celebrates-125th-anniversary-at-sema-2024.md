# HELLA Celebrates 125th Anniversary at SEMA 2024

Legendary German lighting specialist HELLA is racing into Central Hall at SEMA 2024 to celebrate 125 years at the forefront of performance and off-road lighting technology. It will be joined by Jimco Racing – itself celebrating 50 years in the dirt – to debut its newly developed 1-2/1600 Class Buggy fitted with the latest and greatest HELLA products in SEMA booth #23335 in Central Hall.

As an additional treat, HELLA and Jimco will display a Spec Trophy Truck. Parked outside Central Hall, the off-road beast will also showcase the latest HELLA products. And parked alongside the Trophy Truck will be the Rotek Racing Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS Clubsport, which claimed multiple 2024 SRO Pirelli GT4 championships with HELLA illuminating the way.

HELLA CELEBRATES 125

Founded in 1899, HELLA is one of the oldest automotive accessories suppliers in the world. Known for its unrivalled German engineering and top quality lighting built to OE standards, the company has operated as a brand in North America for more than 40 years.

While vehicle original equipment, off-road and performance lighting will always illuminate its path, HELLA has diversified its portfolio over the decades into categories such as brakes, sensors, engine management and more. The company continues to set the bar for safety, visibility, and performance, specifically in the off-road and performance markets where the HELLA brand is legendary.

While HELLA has continued to reinforce its reputation as a trusted off-road partner, it has also increased activity at off-road and motorsports events to leverage its strong brand equity and introduce new technology.

Located in SEMA booth #23335 in Central Hall, HELLA will be highlighting a number of cutting-edge products including HELLA Blade LED lights, Black Magic light bars, X-Treme LED cube lights, and the new HELLA Lift Kits.

"HELLA has always been about more than just lighting; it's about telling a story,” said Rob Tinson, Vice President of Sales and Marketing for HELLA. “When you equip your vehicle with HELLA, you elevate your ride to a true expression of adventure, precision, quality and individuality. Our passion for continuing the brand’s legacy extends to our partnerships, which help showcase the HELLA story. We value both their professional input with our products and enjoy their successes. The team at Rotek Racing drove the HELLA-sponsored Porsche GT4 RS to Championship victories this season. Our connection to Robb Holand and the Rotek team not only displays prominent HELLA branding at races but solidifies our reputation as a premium supplier of several automotive parts for Porsche, including lighting. And the top off-road builders at Jimco Racing demand the best in terms of safety and performance, specifically their need for the best products available. The company’s legacy is unmatched and has developed loyalty around quality and performance like HELLA. These collaborations reflect our commitment to excellence, evolution, and innovation. A Legend is Reborn at HELLA.”

JIMCO 1600 CLASS BUGGY

As one of the leading off-road experts, Jimco Racing celebrates 50 years as one of the sport’s premier builders with the launch of its all-new 1-2/1600 Desert Buggy. Intended to complement its existing range of racing vehicles while returning the company’s Limited Class roots, the innovative Jimco N-spec two-seat chassis was designed to offer racers a more affordable way to eat dirt.

The custom chassis will be powered by a proven1600cc Volkswagen air-cooled powerplant from Jimenez Racing Engines and mated to a modified Volkswagen gearbox built by California Performance Transmission.

Equipped with Fox Shox and ProAM hubs to mount the Method Wheels with BFGoodrich tires, the combination will help the driver maintain control in the toughest conditions.

Among the most essential equipment for any desert racer is lighting, and HELLA has provided a suite of its latest technology including its Black Magic Tough Double Row Curved light bar, 6" HELLA Blade lights and HELLA X-treme 4.3" LED lights. With this cutting edge technology, the team is able to follow the trail on even the darkest nights.

Debuting in the HELLA booth #23335 in Central Hall at SEMA 2024, the Jimco 1-2/1600 Class Buggy is one of the most affordable entries into the competitive and exciting world of off-road racing, created by the company named “Builder of the Year” by SCORE International a record 25 times.

Jimco representatives will be available throughout the show to discuss vehicle specifics with show attendees.

JIMCO SPEC TROPHY TRUCK

Powered by a Chevrolet 525 RLB crate engine with RDE T400 transmission and Fortin underdrive, the truck rides on Fox Shox and bump stops with a Gearworks 10” third Member. Rolling stock again features 17” Method Wheels and 40” BFG Baja T/A tires for maximum traction.

Illuminating its path are a host of HELLA lighting products, including the Black Magic Tough Double Row Curved light bar above the windshield aperture, plus a total of seven 6" HELLA Blade lights on the front bumper. For crew use, there are HELLA X-treme 4.3" LED lights mounted on the B-pillars, while a Black Magic Tough Single Row light bar has been fitted to the rear as a chase light.

The HELLA / Jimco Racing Spec Trophy Truck can be found outside Central Hall in display spot V018.

“It’s been great to work with HELLA with its incredible motorsports legacy,” said Rafael Navarro IV from Jimco Racing. “Not only does HELLA have an incredible history in off-road racing, but it’s also at the cutting edge of the sport with its newest innovation and technology. At Jimco, we’re stoked to work with brands that have the same thirst to stay ahead of the competition. As a partner, HELLA can help us maintain our position as a fortress brand in the off-road world where we’re engineering and building platforms that are out front, winning races,” he continued. “We’re especially excited to reveal our new 1600, which was in final assembly during the days leading up to SEMA. Now completed, we’re looking forward to seeing both vehicles decked out in the iconic HELLA livery and on display at the show!”

ROTEK RACING PORSCHE 718 CAYMAN GT4 RS CLUBSPORT

HELLA partnered with Rotek Racing in 2022 and this year the team swept the board in both the Pirelli GT America and GT4 America road racing championships. The team uses Porsche factory built and prepared Cayman GT4 RS Clubsport cars, which clearly gave them an advantage this year. In fact, Rotek won a total of four championships, taking the driver and team titles in both classes.

Isaac Sherman drove in GT America and scored 13 wins plus three podiums, while Robb Holland and Jaden Lander secured four wins and two additional podiums to claim the GT4 honors.

The championship-winning Rotek Racing Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS Clubsport can be found outside Central Hall in display spot V017.
