# PathAI Launches PathExplore™ Fibrosis: An AI-Powered Pathology Breakthrough in Fibrosis, Collagen, and Fiber Quantification Directly from Whole Slide Images

PathAI, a leader in AI-powered pathology solutions, is proud to introduce PathExplore™ Fibrosis1 on our AISight® Translational Research platform, a one-of-a-kind AI tool designed to revolutionize fibrosis, collagen, and fiber quantification directly from whole-slide images (WSIs) of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue. PathExplore™ Fibrosis offers an unprecedented ability to analyze morphology and spatial organization of fibrosis in the tumor microenvironment (TME) directly from routine pathology images at scale, providing new insights into tumor biology and therapeutic response.

Fibrosis and collagen fibers are emerging as crucial biomarkers and drug targets due to their potential roles in cancer progression, metastasis, and immune response. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, PathExplore™ Fibrosis offers scalable, rapid analysis, making it a transformative tool in oncology translational research.

PathAI’s solution facilitates this analysis directly from routine H&E pathology images from standard imaging platforms, democratizing access to key insights into tumor biology and therapeutic responses without the need of custom microscopy.

"What began as internal research by our scientific team has evolved into a powerful tool for cancer researchers, enabling them to explore previously inaccessible aspects of tumor morphology," said Ben Glass, VP of Product and Translational Research at PathAI. "Fibrosis is increasingly recognized as a potentially important biomarker in cancer research. By making it possible to study this directly from routine H&E images, we’re providing researchers with the means to scale their understanding of disease biology, evaluate drug efficacy, and drive the development of new fibrosis-related therapies."

“By combining the cell and tissue features provided by PathExplore™2 with collagen and fibrosis measurements from PathExplore™ Fibrosis, researchers now have access to an unprecedented multidimensional view of the TME,” said Eric Walk, M.D., FCAP, chief medical officer at PathAI. “From a single image, researchers can ask and answer new questions about the organization and morphology of fibrosis in the TME and how this inhibits or promotes cancer progression.”

PathAI will be presenting novel findings utilizing PathExplore™ Fibrosis and the underlying technology at the upcoming Society of Immunotherapy of Cancer conference (SITC 2024) on November 6-11, 2024, in Houston, Texas.
