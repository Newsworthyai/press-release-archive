The company supplies lubricating oil to Japanese and Asian manufacturers for factory fill around the world. It also provides the aftermarket with premium vehicle lubricants and is introducing a new line of EV/Hybrid fluids to assist with long term vehicle maintenance.

ENEOS booth #24133 will feature a pair of high-profile vehicles, including a widebody 1971 Datsun 240Z and 1972 Toyota Celica. Both feature significant engine upgrades in addition to bodywork and chassis modifications that will appeal to performance enthusiasts. Additionally, ENEOS invited two vehicles from its annual Show Car Contest. A 1960 Renault Dauphine with a mid-engined VW VR6 engine conversion and 1100hp Mk4 Toyota Supra will both be displayed in Silver Lot V024 and V025. Details and photographs of all four vehicles are available below and in the News section on the ENEOS website here: eneos.us

1971 DATSUN 240Z

The ENEOS booth #24133 will feature John Lau's “Devil Z” Datsun 240Z (S30), which was inspired by the anime manga series Wangan Midnight. The project is a collaboration between Lau and designer Jon Sibal – a SEMA veteran who designed the Datsun’s muscular widebody styling, also incorporating a Skillard custom front splitter and rear diffuser.

The wider fenders allowed significantly bigger 17x11.5” front, 18x13” rear Work Meister M1 wheels with Toyo Proxes R888R tires. And with all that grip, the owner wanted to ensure the ENEOS-lubricated engine was up to the challenge, so he installed a Datsun 280ZX L28 bored to L30 with forged 87mm flat-top pistons, forged H-beam connecting rods, and a ported and polished P90 head. A Garrett G35-900 turbo was mounted on a Protuner ZTurbo manifold and downpipe, which forces air into a fabricated intake plenum with 47mm velocity stacks. Everything is controlled by a Haltech 2500 ECU programmed for E85 and providing traction control.

Power is transmitted through a Nissan G37 six-speed transmission to a Ford Super 8 diff. Apex Engineered takes care of the major suspension components while Turbohoses crafted 340mm carbon-ceramic rotors to ensure the 240Z could stop efficiently.

The car features a number of special emblems and easter eggs for visitors to find. These include billet pitchfork emblems on the exterior, a billet "Devil Z" oil cap under the hood, and personalized "Devil Z" Speedhut gauges inside. The car was assembled and painted by Supreme Auto Body, finished in Porsche PTS San Marino Blue Metallic.

1972 TOYOTA CELICA

Displayed alongside the 240Z in ENEOS booth #24133 is the first-generation Toyota Celica belonging to veteran racer, Formula DRIFT team manager and engineer, Stephan Papadakis. The barn find-turned-showpiece is Steph’s personal project, which has been chronicled on his popular social media channels, gaining hundreds of thousands of views.

The 1972 Celica had been sitting for more than 20 years before Steph discovered it and began his off-season passion project to keep himself busy in between Formula DRIFT competition. The restoration included a bare metal bodywork overhaul, while the rare 18R-G four-cylinder, eight-valve, twin-cam engine was fully rebuilt and bored to 2.2 liters. Lubricated by ENEOS motor oil, it was converted to dual 44 Mikuni PHH side-draft carburetors and runs a Link ECU thanks to a full motorsport-spec wiring harness to enhance reliability. The engine produced 170hp close to its 8000rpm maximum, necessitating four-piston Wilwood big brakes front and rear. Steph significantly upgraded the suspension using JRZ dampers, Techno Toy Tuning front spindles and tension control rods, Annex Suspension caster and camber plates, four-link rear suspension and panhard bar.

Steph was able to increase wheel and tire widths thanks to TRD-style fender flares, which were produced by Toy Garage along with a lip spoiler and rear wing to enhance the Celica’s road presence. The new fenders accommodate custom 15” three-piece wheels inspired by Tom’s heritage design.

For anybody unfamiliar with Stephan Papadakis, he established an unbeatable reputation in Import Drag Racing, building the first front-wheel-drive, tube-chassis drag car. He then set records with the world’s fastest FWD and RWD Hondas, the first import driver to break 6sec, and the first to exceed 180mph. Steph was the 1999 SEMA Import Racer of the Year, 2000 NIRA Pro Comp Champion, 2001 NIRA Pro FWD Champion and IDRC Outlaw Class Champion.

Joining Formula DRIFT in 2004, Papadakis Racing has won the PRO Championship in 2007 and 2008 with Tanner Foust driving, as well as 2015, 2021 and 2022 with Fredric Aasbo at the wheel of the 1200hp Toyota GR Supra. During the interim years, Papadakis cars have placed in the top three on numerous occasions, and Steph himself has been voted Formula Drift Team Manager of the Year several times.

The Papadakis Racing Rockstar Energy / Toyota Racing GR Supra has been a regular podium contender using ENEOS motor and gear oils. Steph also uses ENEOS lubricants in all his personal projects, including the 1972 Toyota Celica.

![1960 Renault Dauphine is at SEMA 2024 with ENEOS Motor Oil. It has a 230hp VW VR6 engine, custom widebody, and plenty of patina](https://public.newsdirect.com/479437944/v5sMES9x.jpg)

1960 RENAULT DAUPHINE

As the winner of the 2024 ENEOS x Pit+Paddock Show Car Contest, 20-year Navy veteran Justin Cashmore was invited to display his car outdoors at SEMA. Having retired in 2019, he found time to “build stuff I like in the best way I can.” Stationed in Japan, Italy, Florida, and California, he found inspiration in automotive trends around the world, which he’s been able to translate into various builds, including his extraordinary Renault.

Justin “pulled the car out of the desert” in 2017 and it became a Hot Wheels Legends Tour Finalist in 2019. It’s since been featured by Stanceworks, Autopia LA, Hoonigan and Avants before being chosen as our winner of the ENEOS x Pit+Paddock Show Car Contest.

While the Renault wears its patina with pride, Justin’s Group 5 racing-inspired carbon fiber widebody, which extended the car 22” wider than stock, might distract you from its mid-engined layout. Sitting transversely behind the rear firewall is a 2.8L Volkswagen VR6 24v engine. Thanks to a United Motorsports tune, custom intake and exhaust, the VR6 develops 230hp.

The power is transmitted by a VW 02M six-speed transmission with Peloquin limited-slip differential. The driver sits on the right side of the cockpit inside the custom chassis and is protected by a “bumper-to-bumper” rollcage. The chassis allowed Justin to build a custom pushrod/bellcrank suspension system, incorporating NASCAR take-off Schroeder sway bars.

The custom fenders accommodate 17” Felgen Factory wheels with extra-wide Toyo R888R rubber and a Wilwood big brake kit.

1995 TOYOTA SUPRA

As a runner-up in the 2024 ENEOS x Pit+Paddock Show Car Contest, Leo Barrit was invited to display his Mk4 Supra JZA80 outdoors at SEMA. Based in San Diego, Leo has owned the car for the last 12 years and used his time productively to build it to an incredible specification.

The highlights included a fully rebuilt 2JZ-GTE VVTi engine, which was stroked to 3.3L with a Brian Crower billet crank, 272 cams, gears, and a Ferrea valvetrain, featuring custom Hypertune cam covers, intake manifold, and fuel rail. Fitted with a custom twin-turbo setup, it uses BorgWarner EFR 7163 turbos, Turbosmart internal wastegates and blow-off valves, plus a custom manifold and hand-welded titanium piping. In this state, the engine develops more than 1100hp.

The Supra features a unique Varis widebody kit that blends Ridox fenders with Solid and Joker aero pieces. It’s complemented by a Varis carbon fiber hood, canards and GT wing.

Advan RZ-DF2 wheels were wrapped in Toyo Proxes R888R tires, while Brembo GT-S six-piston monobloc front calipers and four-piston rears were hard anodized black and provide optimal braking. The Supra has KW V3 coilovers with Stanceparts air cups to provide driveway clearance.

The interior features period-correct Recaro Tomcat seats in yellow Kevlar fabric with matching rears. There’s also a matching steering wheel and Alcantara headliner, both with hand-stitched yellow accents.

The sound system utilizes an Alpine ILX-507 head unit and Focal Flax EVO speakers plus a 10" JL subwoofer in a custom enclosure powered by a Focal amp.
