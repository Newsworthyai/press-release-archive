The 2024 Crossroads Summit is less than a month away – get your tickets for this event that promises important insights!

When Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an executive outplacement firm, began tracking the effect AI was having on labor markets, it noted that it was “no longer a just threat on the horizon.” One of America’s leading authorities on hyperautomation, a combination of robotic process automation (RPA) and AI, agrees that the future is almost here – but it doesn’t have to mean jobs are threatened.

Will The Risks Of AI Outweigh Its RewardsAccording to award-winning expert Pascal Bornet, “algorithms are to white-collar workers what tractors were to farmers.” Bornet should know. He is a recognized thought leader on the subjects of RPA and AI.

Bornet is the author of the best-selling book “Intelligent Automation” and is ranked as one of the top 10 global experts in AI and Automation. He was named the Global Top Voice in Tech in 2019 and the number one Global Thought Leader in RPA in 2020.

In 2022, Bornet was named one of the 50 most powerful AI influencers, and in 2023, he was named a top 50 global thought leader and influencer on AI. He is currently among the top 25 AI Influencers to follow in 2024.

Bornet is a senior executive with more than 20 years of experience in digital transformation. He founded and led the “AI and Automation” practices at McKinsey & Company and Ernst & Young (EY) and is currently on the leadership team of Mountain View, California-based software innovator Aera Technology.

Published in Forbes, Bloomberg, The World Economic Forum, McKinsey Quarterly, The Times, Japan Times, Business Times, AI Magazine and CIO Advisors, Bornet is a member of the Forbes Technology Council, a Senior Advisor for the Institute of Robotic, Automation and Artificial Intelligence (IRPAAI), and a senior advisor and board member to several startup enterprises and nonprofits.

Bornet notes that RPA and AI are tools that “dramatically increase the productivity of each worker, and thus shrink the total number of workers required to produce the same output.” But he also points out that “as some work activities are displaced, new ones, more fulfilling and value-adding, arise.”

This dichotomy between the potential risks and opportunities created by hyperautomation will be among the subjects Bornet addresses as a keynote speaker at the upcoming Crossroads Summit to be held on November 21st and 22nd in Miami, Florida.

Why Investors And Business Leaders Are Attending The Crossroads SummitEven as hyperautomation often presents contrasting paths leading to potential risks and opportunities, the Crossroads Summit, sponsored by TradeStation Group, offers leaders a vision into the broader theme of juxtaposing potential risks against possible opportunities that could emerge from a rapidly changing world.

Apart from disruptions related to technology, like the rise of AI and decentralized currencies, economic uncertainty defined by the end of near-zero interest rates and stubborn inflation pressure exists in a world where regional conflict and global tension remain in daily headlines. Yet emerging from each of these unsettling challenges could be unexpected investment opportunities.

In the United States alone, every change in the federal government’s stance on regulating businesses and fiscal and monetary policy brings the potential for new investable products to emerge.

The Crossroads Summit was created to provide business leaders and investors with an opportunity to hear from – and mingle with – some of the most respected authorities in disciplines including economics and political science, history and demographics and technology and automation.

The Crossroads Summit could be a catalyst for uncovering opportunities for many, a place to forge new connections and a chance to redefine your future investments.
