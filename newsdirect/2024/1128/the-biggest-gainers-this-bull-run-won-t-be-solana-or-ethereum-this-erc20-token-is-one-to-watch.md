# The Biggest Gainers This Bull Run Won't Be Solana Or Ethereum, This ERC20 Token Is One To Watch

At the risk of stating the obvious, Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are poised to hit new all-time highs. However, given the massive size of their market caps, it’s unlikely for both projects to experience the same price multipliers that shook the crypto community in the past.

Savvy investors know that the real opportunity is found in undervalued, low-cap gems like Cutoshi.

Ethereum Is Gaining Ground, $5,000 Next?In November, Ethereum awoke from its slumber with a 40% monthly surge that saw the ETH price soar. At press time, Ethereum trades at $3,528 with a 5.3% intraday increase. On the Ethereum chart, a string of higher lows confirms that ETH is moving in an ascending channel as buying pressure is building up.

Analyst Jelle has shared a chart reading on X that looks at the macro picture. Ethereum is rapidly approaching a multi-year descending trendline that has acted as a dynamic resistance ever since ETH reached its $4,891 all-time high in 2021. A breakout above this trendline could see Ethereum gain escape velocity and soar above $5,000 with relative ease.

Furthermore, for the first time ever, Ethereum ETFs have surpassed BTC ETFs in net inflows. On November 26, Bitcoin ETFs recorded over $123 million in net outflows. On the same day, Ethereum saw $40 million in net inflows.

Solana Rebounds 4% After CorrectionSolana (SOL) has been making headlines throughout 2024 between its meme coin factory churning tens of millions in revenue and a possible SOL ETF launch. Just recently, Solana reached a new all-time high of $263, totaling over 40% monthly gains. This latest push saw Solana overtake long-standing rival BNB as the 4th largest cryptocurrency with $113 billion in market cap.

As traders started booking profits, Solana retraced all the way down to the $214 support, from where it rebounded and settled at $236. On-chain analysis shows that Solana could be in for some more disruption, as $6 billion in short positions have piled up, significantly boosting selling pressure.

However, if Solana bulls hold their ground and push the price higher, a massive liquidation could fuel a massive SOL rally and send its price into the stratosphere.

On X, influencer CryptoCurb has shared an interesting opinion, juxtaposing Ethereum’s 2021 price structure with that of Solana’s today. If this scenario plays out, Solana could skyrocket to $1,000 at the peak of the bull run in 2025.

Despite the significant gains that both Solana and Ethereum will undoubtedly bring, Cutoshi could still outperform them both given the magnitudes and smaller size of its market cap.
