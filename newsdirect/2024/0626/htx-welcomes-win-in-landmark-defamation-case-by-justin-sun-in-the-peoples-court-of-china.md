# HTX Welcomes Win in Landmark Defamation Case by Justin Sun in the People’s Court of China

Singapore, June 26, 2024 – HTX announces that the People’s Court of China has ruled in favor of Sun Yuchen (“Justin Sun”), Member of the HTX Global Advisory Board, in a landmark defamation suit against Chongqing Business Media Group ("Business Media").

On 11 March 2022, Business Media published a video and an article titled "FBI Investigates Justin Sun for Suspected Insider Trading" which contained completely false narratives and accusations against Sun, severely damaging his reputation. After more than two years of fact-finding and trials, the court found no evidence supporting any of the claims made in the video and article, and decisively ruled in favor of Sun, ordering that the defamatory content be removed and that a public apology be issued.

HTX welcomes the People’s Court's adjudication and reiterates its commitment to operating in compliance and providing users with a safe and reliable crypto trading platform.
