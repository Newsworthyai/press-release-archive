Oral health plays a vital role in our daily lives, impacting our ability to speak, smile and eat comfortably. Maintaining good dental hygiene not only enhances our appearance and self-esteem but also significantly influences overall well-being. Research has linked poor oral health to serious health issues such as heart disease, respiratory infections, stroke, diabetes and certain cancers.

Finding affordable dental care is crucial for families. Traditional insurance has long been the standard, but dental savings plans are a flexible, cost-effective alternative. DentalPlans.com, a leader in dental savings plans, has transformed access to dental care in the U.S. over the past 25 years, making it easier for families to access affordable dental care without sacrificing quality.

Understanding The Differences: Traditional Insurance Vs. Dental Savings PlansTraditional dental insurance typically involves paying monthly premiums in exchange for coverage that includes a percentage of costs for various services. These plans often come with annual spending caps, deductibles and waiting periods, which can limit immediate access to certain treatments. Additionally, there may be exclusions for pre-existing conditions and network restrictions that confine patients to a specific group of providers.

In contrast, the dental savings plans available on DentalPlans.com do away with these limitations. By offering membership-based access to discounted rates from a vast network of over 140,000 dentists and specialists, these plans provide substantial savings without deductibles or annual limits. Plan members can receive care for existing dental conditions and enjoy flexibility in choosing their providers nationwide. Simply show your membership card at the dentist to receive savings.

No Limits, No Restrictions: A Key AdvantageOne of traditional insurance's most significant drawbacks is the cap on coverage. Annual limits for a PPO plan are typically between $1,000 and $1,500 and can be quickly exhausted, especially when you need major dental procedures like root canals or crowns, which can cost between $750 and $2,000 per tooth. Once these limits are reached, patients must cover the remaining costs out-of-pocket while continuing to pay their insurance premiums.

The dental savings plans on DentalPlans.com eliminate these restrictions, allowing plan members to access necessary dental care without worrying about annual limits. This includes treatments for existing dental conditions. Families can see as many participating providers as needed–for any number of reasons – including virtually all treatments, from cleanings to braces to root canals and dental implants.

Extensive Network With Flexibility And InclusivityThe dental savings plans on DentalPlans.com are accepted by over 140,000 dentists and specialists nationwide, including pediatric dentists, orthodontists and endodontists, so choosing a dental savings plan doesn’t sacrifice network size. This broad network ensures that all family dental needs are met. The company offers more than 25 dental plans from top healthcare brands like Cigna, Aetna, Careington, United Concordia and Dentegra, ensuring your family will find a plan that fits its needs and budget.

Dental savings plans also provide the flexibility to switch plans. Whether your family needs preventive care, braces for a child, or a root canal for an adult, DentalPlans.com allows for a seamless transition between plans, maximizing savings and maintaining continuous care.

Ease Of Use And Significant Savings DentalPlans.com simplifies getting dental care with dental savings plans, which are easy to use and activate quickly (within 1-3 business days of signup).
