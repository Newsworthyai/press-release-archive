# NanoViricides Reports Promising Results for NV-387 in Influenza A H3N2 Mouse Model

NanoViricides CEO Dr Anil Diwan joined Steve Darling from Proactive to share promising news about the company's ultra-broad-spectrum antiviral, NV-387. The antiviral was found to be effective in protecting lungs from damage in a lethally infected Influenza A H3N2 mouse model.

Dr. Diwan explained that the lung protection provided by NV-387 is particularly important, as severe cases of respiratory viral infections, which often lead to hospitalization and fatalities, typically involve extensive lung damage. In the study, NV-387 oral treatment resulted in only about 31% lung infiltration by immune system cells, while NV-387 intravenous treatment showed an even lower infiltration rate of about 22%. In comparison, the lungs of infected untreated animals exhibited a high infiltration rate of 68%. These findings indicate that NV-387 significantly protects the lungs of Balb/c mice lethally infected with the Influenza A H3N2 virus. Moreover, NV-387 treatment resulted in a significantly greater survival improvement compared to three approved influenza drugs. This remarkable outcome highlights the potential of NV-387 as a powerful therapeutic option for treating severe influenza infections and possibly other respiratory viral infections.

Further, in this study, NV-387 was also found to protect the lungs of the infected animals from viral damage as well as immune system damage, supporting a strong antiviral effect. These results have arrived just as the bird flu H5N1 threat potential has increased significantly due to its spread into several mammalian species. While dairy cattle have suffered relatively mild infections, some other mammals, particularly cats on farms, have died of brain infection with this virus. Only four human cases have occurred so far, with one person dying in Mexico, while the three other cases, all in the USA, have recovered.

This highlights the urgency and potential impact of NV-387 in addressing not only current viral threats but also emerging ones, making it a critical development in the field of antiviral therapies.
