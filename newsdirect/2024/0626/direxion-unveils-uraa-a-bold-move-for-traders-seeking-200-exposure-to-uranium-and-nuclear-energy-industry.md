# Direxion Unveils URAA: A Bold Move for Traders Seeking 200% Exposure to Uranium and Nuclear Energy Industry

Direxion, a leading provider of tradeable and thematic ETFs, today announced the launch of the Direxion Daily Uranium Industry Bull 2X Shares (Ticker: URAA). URAA seeks to achieve 200%, before fees and expenses, of the daily performance of the Solactive United States Uranium and Nuclear Energy ETF Select Index.

“Uranium prices have reached the highest levels in over 15 years, and the uranium market is seeing incredible growth. But there’s a significant gap between supply and demand, that begs further development and investment,” said Direxion Managing Director, Edward Egilinsky. “As public sentiment and government support shifts in favor of further expansion, URAA offers traders a unique way to make short-term bets on the nuclear energy industry.”

The global markets landscape is rapidly evolving, presenting new challenges and opportunities. As the uranium and nuclear energy industry continues to show promising growth, Direxion is committed to providing traders with timely vehicles to align with the shifting dynamics of the financial markets.

They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by sophisticated investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.
