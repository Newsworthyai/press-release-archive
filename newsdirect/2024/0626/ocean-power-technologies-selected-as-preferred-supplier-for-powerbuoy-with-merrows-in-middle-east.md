# Ocean Power Technologies Selected as Preferred Supplier for PowerBuoy with Merrows in Middle East

Ocean Power Technologies CEO Philipp Stratmann joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce that the company has been selected as a preferred supplier for a PowerBuoy equipped with Merrows, its Artificial Intelligence-capable Maritime Domain Awareness Solution. This selection is for an immediate delivery opportunity in the Middle East. The contract, once finalized, is expected to generate revenues in the current quarter. The company had previously announced the completion of engineering for Merrows to operate in hot climates.

Stratmann highlighted that this development is another example of the company's growth in its PowerBuoy business. He emphasized that the Middle East presents significant opportunities for Merrows and the potential to integrate additional Wave Adaptive Modular Vessels (WAM-Vs) into their operations.

This strategic move underscores Ocean Power Technologies' commitment to expanding its market presence and leveraging its advanced maritime technologies to meet the growing demand in the Middle East.
