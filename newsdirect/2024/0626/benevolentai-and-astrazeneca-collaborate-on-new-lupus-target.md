# BenevolentAI and AstraZeneca collaborate on new lupus target

BenevolentAI chief scientific officer Dr Anne Phelan speaks to Proactive's Stephen Gunnion about the addition of a novel systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) target to AstraZeneca's discovery portfolio.

Phelan discussed the collaboration between BenevolentAI and AstraZeneca, which began in 2019 focusing on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and chronic kidney disease and later expanded to include heart failure and lupus.

She highlighted the benefits of this collaboration, stating, "We can really leverage the power of the interconnectivity of the data foundations to pull through potential target hypotheses irrespective of the disease."

Phelan explained how BenevolentAI's data-driven approach, combined with AstraZeneca's disease expertise, facilitates the identification and validation of new therapeutic targets.

She also provided insights into lupus, describing it as a debilitating autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks its own tissues, leading to chronic fatigue and damage to vital organs. The BenevolentAI platform's ability to handle complex data and generate explainable hypotheses is pivotal in identifying new therapeutic targets for such complex diseases.
