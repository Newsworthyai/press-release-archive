# American Paper Plate Coalition Welcomes Preliminary Duties on Imports from China and Vietnam

Today, the U. S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) announced its preliminary determination that the governments of China and Vietnam unfairly subsidize their paper plate industries, and the resulting duties on imports from each country: up to 313.14 percent on imports from China and up to 237.65 percent on imports from Vietnam . The American Paper Plate Coalition ("APPC") representing the majority of imports of Amercan paper pllate production, welcomes the decision to impose duties.

"The unlawful subsidies received by Chinese and Vietnamese producers have given them an unfair advantage in the U.S. market - this has haad a direct negative impact on American producerrs and employees," said William P. Biggens, Jr., President and Co-Owner of APPC member Aspen Products, Inc. "Imposing duties to offset unlawful subsidies is an important first step to ensuring the future health of our industry. We are encouraged that Commerce has taken prelininary action to restore a level playing field."

Today’s announcements address petitions filed by the APPC in January, detailing unfair trade practices to sell unlawfully subsidized paper plates at less than fair value. Commerce began investigating the AD and CVD claims in February.

The countervailing duty investigations concerning imports from China and Vietnam are ongoing and may lead to higher final CVD rates. Final determinations in the China and Vietnam CVD investigations are expected in early November 2024. Preliminary determinations in the companion AD investigations of imports from China, Vietnam, and Thailand are due August 22, 2024.

“Today’s announcement and the high duties being imposed validate the analysis we presented when we filed these cases and the extent of the problem that drove us to file in the first place,” said Robert Epstein, President and CEO of APPC member AJM Packaging Corporation. “We appreciate the Commerce Department’s hard work and diligent efforts to administer our trade laws as Congress intended.”
