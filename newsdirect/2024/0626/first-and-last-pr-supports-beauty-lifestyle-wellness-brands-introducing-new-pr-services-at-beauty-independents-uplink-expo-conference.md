First and Last PR, a communications agency that specializes in public relations, influencer campaigns and social media marketing, renowned for an unparalleled delivery in serving communication solutions to legacy brands announces its two new public relations offerings, tailored specifically to meet the needs of indie and emerging beauty, wellness and lifestyle brands: PR Powerboost for emerging brands and Seasonal Spotlights that will focus on inclusion during key holiday times of the year.

“With over 25 years of industry experience, the one thing that remains consistent is that emerging brands need support and should not have to choose between a great communications team and packaging,” said Stephanie Scott-Bradshaw, First and Last PR’s CEO & Communicator-in-Chief. “When it comes to media relations and digital marketing, we are here to serve. We look forward to seeing more indie and emerging brands grow with our newest service offerings. Whether you're a direct-to-consumer (DTC) brand with hopes of being in store or have recently landed at retail, we know that it's not enough to have shelf space. What you really need, is an experienced team with a strategic plan that will help push your brand’s visibility and awareness so that you remain on shelf. That's why we designed these programs for you.”
