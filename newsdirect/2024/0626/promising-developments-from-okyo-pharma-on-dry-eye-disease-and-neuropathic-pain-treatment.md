# Promising Developments from OKYO Pharma on Dry Eye Disease and Neuropathic Pain Treatment

OKYO Pharma Ltd CEO Gary Jacobs joined Steve Darling from Proactive to share additional key findings from the Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of OK-101 (0.05%) ophthalmic solution in patients with dry eye disease (DED). This trial involved 240 patients in a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study. OK-101, developed using a membrane-anchored-peptide technology, is a novel long-acting drug candidate designed to treat dry eye disease. It has shown anti-inflammatory and pain-reducing efficacy in mouse models of dry eye disease and corneal neuropathic pain.

Jacobs highlighted that the findings include a statistically significant and durable reduction in ocular pain and a statistically significant improvement in Tear Film Break-Up Time throughout the study, which is a clinically important endpoint. Additionally, multiple symptomatic improvements were observed through both data obtained from patient clinic visits and daily symptom diaries.

Jacob explained that OK-101 targets a receptor called Chemerin 23, present on both immune and nerve cells, including those in the spinal cord and ocular nerves. Preclinical animal studies indicated that OK-101 could reduce neuropathic pain, which can be particularly severe and debilitating in affected patients. The company is preparing to launch a Phase II trial for OK-101 specifically targeting neuropathic corneal pain.

This trial will be a placebo-controlled, randomized study involving 48 patients diagnosed with ocular nerve damage through confocal microscopy, with top-line data anticipated by mid-2025.The significance of this development is underscored by the lack of FDA-approved treatments for neuropathic corneal pain, a condition recognised by the National Organization of Rare Diseases. The upcoming trial aims to fill this therapeutic gap, potentially offering relief to patients suffering from this excruciating condition.
