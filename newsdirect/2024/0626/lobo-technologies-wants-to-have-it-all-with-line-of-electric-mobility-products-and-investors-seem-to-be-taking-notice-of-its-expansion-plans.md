From bikes to scooters, the electric vehicle market is taking off, driven by greater awareness around the benefits of EVs, demand for better mobility solutions in dense urban settings and supportive government policies.

As a result, the global e-bike, e-trike and e-scooter industry is forecast to reach $77.6 billion by the end of 2028, growing at a CAGR of 11.6%.

LOBO Has It All For players in this market, going after just one area of the EV industry can be a big opportunity, but operating in it all including e-bicycles, e-mopeds, e-tricycles and electric off-highway four-wheeled shuttles, plus offering automobile information and entertainment software on top of that, can be game-changing. That is exactly what LOBO Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ: LOBO) is doing. The Chinese EV manufacturer has a multi-pronged approach to dominate the market with its wide range of electric mobility vehicles.

LOBO, which already has an established track record, is aiming to be an OEM and ODM leader in the intelligent urban e-bike, e-trike and off-highway four-wheeled electric vehicles (EVs) market over the next decade by making EVs tailored for various demographics, including mobility solutions for the elderly and disabled. The company follows an asset-light business model through which it leverages its just-in-time production model to align supply and demand trends and minimize excess inventory. To keep margins high, the company outsources the production of some models that are more costly to make in-house.

Innovating In The Marketplace LOBO is an innovator in the industry, leveraging advanced technologies in connectivity, multimedia, interactive systems and artificial intelligence to enhance users’ experiences and stand out from its rivals.

Take its recently launched solar-powered electric tricycle for one example. It is equipped with high-quality solar panels designed to capture and convert the sun's energy, providing continuous power to the tricycle's electric motor. This environmentally friendly tricycle helps reduce carbon emissions, is cost-effective and is easy to maintain, reports LOBO.

Then there is its “King of the Load” e-trike, which is a special-purpose vehicle designed for commuters and delivery services. These e-trikes are not just vehicles but also powerful tools that empower users by providing a means of livelihood, which LOBO says is especially critical in developing countries for increasing income and improving quality of life.

Overseas Expansion LOBO is also focusing on growing its footprint, going after emerging markets seeing increased interest in EVs. That includes ASEAN countries, Eastern Europe – including Serbia, Bulgaria and Ukraine – and Latin America. That cushions the blow from any slowdown in China. All of those markets are growing for LOBO, particularly in Latin America.

Earlier this month, LOBO announced it received its largest single order for e-bikes this year, including electric tricycles, electric bicycles and its newly introduced solar-powered electric tricycles, from Ecuadorian resellers. “Latin America is one of several global markets we’ve targeted for rapid expansion, and this latest order from Ecuador is a testament to our growing footprint and the strong demand for our products in this region,” said CEO Huajian Xu. So far in 2024, LOBO says it has consistently received orders for e-bikes and e-trikes from Latin American dealers in Brazil, Chile, Suriname and other countries.

This week LOBO hosted one of Brazil’s top ten electric mobility dealers, which it had been doing business with for about a year. Following the visit, which included a site inspection, the dealer, which generates more than $8 million a year in sales of short-distance electric vehicles, has determined it will consolidate its production and procurement with LOBO. Up until now, it had used several Chinese manufactures.

“The Brazilian team was particularly impressed with our new model electric tricycles and small four-wheeled elderly mobility vehicle samples. They closely examined the detailed design and craftsmanship, praising our R&D and manufacturing capabilities. The on-the-spot discussions about specific vehicle orders indicate their strong intent to form a close cooperative partnership,” said Xu.

LOBO has been steadily gaining share over the past few years in Latin America and elsewhere, which it credits to its ongoing investment in R&D. That enables LOBO to develop products that resonate with the masses and provide a greener alternative. That is particularly important in the new markets LOBO is going after. Not only are its EVs cheaper than gas-powered vehicles, they can have a huge positive impact on global warming. They don’t add to emissions and can replace cars in many instances. In the U.S., three-fourths of all trips are ten miles or less, highlighting the utility of EVs.

Manufacturing Might Beyond expanding its footprint, LOBO is beefing up its manufacturing so that it can quickly and affordably churn out innovative e-bikes, e-scooters and other green mobility vehicles. Case in point: proceeds from its $5.5 million IPO in March went to expand capacity in a new factory in Wuxi by 20%. That is the equivalent of $27 million in product, LOBO reports.

Investors seem to have been taking notice of all these positive developments, with shares of LOBO recently jumping 16.4% over its order from Ecuador and overall growth. At last check, LOBO has 150 distributors in China and 60 spread out around the result of the world. LOBO plans to expand into two to five more countries this year and strike more partnerships. Given its expansion plans, LOBO’s recent run may not be over yet.
