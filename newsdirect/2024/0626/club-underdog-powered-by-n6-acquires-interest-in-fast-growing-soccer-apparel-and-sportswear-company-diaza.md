“We have been impressed with Diaza’s growth under the leadership of Diego, and we share many of the same values as it relates to customer commitment and work ethic,” said Matt Rizzetta, Founding Partner and Chairman of North Sixth Group, parent company of Club Underdog. “We view this as a highly strategic acquisition which adds differentiation, innovation and accretive value to our portfolio of professional franchises and sports assets.”

Under its Club Underdog subsidiary, North Sixth Group has a successful track record achieving sporting and business results for professional soccer clubs and franchises with rich tradition in strategic locations with high upside potential.

“We are honored to be joining the Club Underdog family and to be a part of something bigger,” said Diego Hurtado, Founder and CEO of Diaza. “I founded this company six years ago with a vision to bring passion, commitment and relentless focus on the customer, which we felt was lacking from the larger apparel providers in the global soccer landscape. We believe the combination of Diaza’s experience in the apparel category along with Club Underdog’s track record owning and operating successful businesses inside and outside of sports, will be a winning combination that will pave the path for the future of how soccer apparel is worn and enjoyed by players and clubs across the world.”

Partners in the ownership group include visionary entrepreneur Morgan Harris, media and sports expert Matt Rizzetta, and private equity industry veteran Daniel Hall.

“Diego is a rare breed of entrepreneur that has the grit and determination to succeed in business today,” said Morgan Harris, Founding Partner and CEO of North Sixth Group, parent company of Club Underdog. “This aligns perfectly with the operating principles of Club Underdog and we are honored to have Diaza join us on our common vision to propel the social, commercial and competitive benefits of soccer forward both in the United States and abroad.”

“We see several operational and financial synergies and value creation drivers by integrating Diaza into our Club Underdog platform of professional football assets,” said Daniel Hall, partner in Club Underdog. “By bringing Diaza into Club Underdog, we are able to add diversified revenue streams generated through merchandising offerings as well as bring in-house apparel production capabilities that are unique and differentiated from traditional sports ownership groups.”
