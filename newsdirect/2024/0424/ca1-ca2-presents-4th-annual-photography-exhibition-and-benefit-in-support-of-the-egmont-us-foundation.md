# CA1 CA2 Presents 4th Annual Photography Exhibition and Benefit in Support of The Egmont US Foundation

--News Direct--

CA1 CA2 invites you to join us on Thursday, April 25th, from 6 pm to 9 pm, as we host our highly anticipated 4th annual photography exhibition and benefit in collaboration with The Egmont US Foundation. The event will take place at White Space Chelsea, situated at 530 W 25th Street between 10th and 11th Avenues.

This year, CA1 CA2 proudly showcases a curated collection of prints generously donated by their acclaimed photographers, including Matthew Chaves, Victor Prado, Marion Grand, Michael Mundy, Hai Ngo, John Von Pamer, Brenton Carter and Anonymous. Each print is part of a limited run of five, making them exclusive collector's items. All proceeds from the sale of these prints will be dedicated to supporting the vital initiatives of The Egmont US Foundation. Additionally, 100% of donations made directly to The Egmont US Foundation will go towards aiding those affected by HIV and AIDS.

The statistics surrounding HIV and AIDS are staggering, with 37.7 million individuals currently living with the disease. Often overshadowed by these figures is the profound impact on the most vulnerable members of society, particularly children. The Egmont US Foundation is committed to addressing this issue by investing in grassroots organizations that implement community-led initiatives. These initiatives provide direct assistance to those affected by HIV and AIDS on a local level. To date, The Egmont US Foundation, in collaboration with The Egmont Trust in the UK, has positively impacted 930,395 individuals across six countries.

"I am deeply committed to a fundamental belief that all humans have a right to four essential needs - food, water, shelter, medicine. Our partnership with The Egmont US Foundation for our 4th annual photography exhibition and benefit exemplifies our dedication to this belief, and human welfare as a whole. Through the collective efforts of our community, artists and clients, we aim to raise funds and awareness for meaningful change.”

- Beata Kanter, President of CA1 CA2
