# Creo Medical says NHS case study reveals significant efficiencies from Speedboat technology

--News Direct--

Creo Medical Group PLC (AIM:CREO) CEO Craig Gulliford discusses an NHS case study that showcases the efficacy of Creo's Speedboat technology.

In an interview with Proactive's Stephen Gunnion, Gulliford discussed the case study, which was conducted by the NHS Supply Chain responsible for the procurement of devices and consumables worth approximately £4 billion. This study, which analysed 130 cases, demonstrated significant cost savings and clinical outcomes, with almost £700,000 saved and reductions in hospital stay times for patients, which potentially impacts surgical and endoscopy waiting lists significantly.

Gulliford also outlined future plans involving routine guidance by NICE and ongoing partnerships with the NHS Supply Chain to further implement and leverage the technology across UK trusts. He emphasized the dual benefits of clinical excellence and cost savings.

Additional updates from Gulliford included progress in other areas of the company, like advancements with robotics and polymeric technology, and significant regulatory developments. Overall, these initiatives are part of Creo’s strategy to expand its product range and increase utilisation of its technology not just in the UK but globally, he added.
