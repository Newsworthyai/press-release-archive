# Nevis Brands announces major shots are now for sale in dozens if dispensaries in Missouri

--News Direct--

Nevis Brands CEO John Kueber joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce the successful completion of the initial production run of Major shots in Missouri through its licensee, Stash House Distro. This milestone marks the expansion of Nevis Brands' product offerings into the Missouri market, with three flavors of its 2-ounce Major shots—Fruit Punch, Blackberry Lemonade, and Blueberry—now available for sale. Nevis Brands has previously introduced these products in Washington and Ohio, achieving successful distribution.

The Major shots are infused with 100mg of THC and leverage a proprietary formula of flavor and emulsion technology, enabling rapid onset effects in under 20 minutes with minimal cannabis taste. The products are now accessible to consumers in numerous dispensaries across Missouri, further solidifying Nevis Brands' presence in the cannabis beverage market.

Additionally, Kueber shared news regarding the restructuring of the company's Promissory Note due to SoRSE Technology Corp., which was initially part of Nevis Brands' purchase of the SoRSE Technology business units "THC Essentials," including the Major brand. Under the revised terms of the agreement, Nevis Brands will pay USD $100,000 by April 30th, 2024, and proceed with periodic payments to retire the note principal by December 31, 2024. This strategic move reflects Nevis Brands' commitment to managing its financial obligations while continuing to expand its product portfolio and market presence.
