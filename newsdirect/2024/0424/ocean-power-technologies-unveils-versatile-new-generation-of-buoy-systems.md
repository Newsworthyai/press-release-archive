# Ocean Power Technologies Unveils Versatile New Generation of Buoy Systems

--News Direct--

Ocean Power Technologies CEO Philipp Stratmann joined Steve Darling from Proactive to share exciting news about the launch of a new generation of buoy systems that mark significant advancements in the company's renewable energy technology. In an interview with Steve Darling from Proactive, Stratmann highlighted key features of these innovative buoy systems, which are designed to accommodate multiple renewable energy sources, including solar panels, wind turbines, and optionally, a wave power cartridge.

One of the most notable improvements is the modular, common equipment system, which eliminates the need for externally moving parts. This design change not only enhances deployment flexibility worldwide but also reduces costs and prices associated with these systems. Additionally, it expands the deployable areas to include regions with variable wave activity, such as the Gulf of Mexico, and even areas where wave power is absent, such as river outlets. This increased versatility allows for broader average power production across different marine and freshwater environments.

Stratmann also highlighted the significant reduction in R&D expenditures since November 2023, attributing this cost efficiency to the successful deployment and seasonal performance validations of the new buoy systems. He emphasized that these innovations are aligned with the growing global focus on zero-carbon solutions and the health of oceanic ecosystems, positioning Ocean Power Technologies as a key player in renewable energy conversations.

Overall, the launch of these new buoy systems represents a significant milestone for Ocean Power Technologies and underscores its commitment to advancing renewable energy technology while addressing environmental challenges.
