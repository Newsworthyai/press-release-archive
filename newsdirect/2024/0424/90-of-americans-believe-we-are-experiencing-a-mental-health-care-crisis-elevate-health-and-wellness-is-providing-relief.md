While the mental health crisis has been slowly brewing for decades, the global pandemic truly shined a spotlight on how many millions of Americans are struggling with mental health. Since the onset of the pandemic, 38% more Americans are participating in mental health care treatment of some kind, whether that be inpatient or outpatient services. Meanwhile, a recent poll done by CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation showed that an overwhelming majority of Americans, roughly 90%, believe we are currently experiencing a mental health care crisis.

The mental healthcare space is experiencing spikes in multiple different areas. One of the more concerning areas that are alarming professionals and the public alike is how youth mental health continues to worsen. In 2021, more than 4 in 10 students felt persistently sad or hopeless, with more than 1 in 5 students seriously considering attempting suicide. Serious mental health diagnoses and rates of addiction have also seen an uptick in recent years. In 2022, the CDC reported 105,454 drug overdose deaths, which was more than double the number from 2015 and a fivefold increase from 2002. Many of these overdoses were among middle-aged men, where an epidemic of loneliness has been reported. Now, more than ever, there is a need for high-quality mental healthcare facilities that can be a beacon of hope for millions of Americans.

How Elevate Health And Wellness Is Revolutionizing The Health Care IndustryElevate Health and Wellness is a dual-licensed outpatient clinic that specializes in mental health and addiction treatment for adolescents and adults in Westport, CT; it provides unique in-person visits and electronic communication software in-between visits. The company’s mission is to provide accessible, compassionate and comprehensive treatment services, and, differentiating it from many competitors, the company has made accepting insurance a key part of its platform. The lack of insurance accepted at inpatient services has historically been a barrier to entry for people who need help and are in a vulnerable position.

The clinic offers a range of in-network services that include outpatient detoxification, medication evaluation and management, individual and family psychotherapy, ADHD evaluation and testing, therapy services, and intensive outpatient programs for adolescents and adults. While many inpatient services do not have a full ecosystem that includes outpatient services, Elevate prides itself on its comprehensive approach to mental health care. The company services over 3,000 patients through its outpatient services and has virtual software to help connect patients to treatment providers with ease.

Elevate's cohesive interdisciplinary team of psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and licensed psychotherapists ensures that every patient receives quality care. The company looks at mental healthcare from a holistic approach and provides nutrition and fitness programs as well as primary care opportunities to ensure that patients have the tools necessary to live healthy and

happy lives.

Elevate is also in the process of obtaining a Certificate of Need (CON) for a new location in Clinton, Connecticut. This expansion aims to meet the growing need for inpatient residential facilities for adult and adolescent populations struggling with mental illness or co-morbid disorders. As Americans grapple with the ongoing mental health care crisis, companies like Elevate are champions for those who are struggling.
