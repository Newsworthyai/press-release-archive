Food insecurity is a big problem in America, with 44 million people, including one in five children, facing food insecurity. In 2022, 49 million people, or one in six in the U.S. relied on food banks, food pantries and local charities to put meals on the table. Hunger affects all ages in America, from children to seniors, with millions more people one job loss, missed paycheck or medical emergency away from also facing food insecurity.

To combat this problem, Feeding America® and Sam’s Club® (a division of Walmart) are teaming up for the 11th year in a row for the Fight Hunger. Spark Change campaign. The campaign aims to raise money to fight food insecurity.

New to the partnership this year is Borealis Foods Inc. (NASDAQ: BRLS), the newly public food tech company dedicated to crafting premium-quality, nutritious food solutions accessible to all. Through its Saluda, SC-based subsidiary, Palmetto Gourmet Foods, the company’s Chef WooTM High Protein Ramen is available as of Apr. 1 for sale for the first time to 69 million members in the nearly 600 Sam's Club stores around the country.

The Fight Hunger. Spark Change. campaign has raised more than $186 million over the past decade and has secured close to 1.9 billion meals for the Feeding America network of local food banks. Donations made during the campaign remain local, with purchases made in-store and online tied to the zip codes serving that area and going to a local Feeding America partner food bank.

First High-Protein Noodle On The Market Borealis Foods says Chef Woo ramen is the first high and complete protein noodle, with 20g of plant-based complete protein, the equivalent of three eggs. The Chef Woo ramen uses a blend of plant-based protein, high-oleic sunflower oil, wheat flour and a variety of other legumes and grains to provide a high-protein option containing all nine essential amino acids. The ramen is fully plant-based with no animal byproducts, minimizing the company’s impact on the planet. Each package also contains 15% of an individual’s daily recommended iron intake.

“We took one of the world’s quickest and most beloved meals and recreated it using simple, nutritious ingredients, like peas, instead of harmful chemicals and preservatives. Each cup of Chef Woo is jam-packed with complete protein, amino acids and essential nutrients,” the company said. Further, all of its products are certified vegan by the American Vegetarian Association.

Making An Impact One Ramen At A TimeBorealis said that for each specially-marked Chef Woo high protein ramen sold at Sam's Club from Apr. 1 to Apr. 29, Borealis will donate the monetary equivalent of at least five meals to Feeding America. Currently, $1 helps provide at least 10 meals secured by Feeding America on behalf of local partner food banks. The partnership with Feeding America and Sam’s Club underscores the company's commitment and focus on fighting food insecurity and helping people across the U.S. Given the amount of protein in Chef Woo, the company hopes it can make a real impact in the fight against food insecurity and malnutrition.

“As a result of our partnership, we have increased our production capacity to meet the increased orders. We are honored to stand alongside Sam’s Club and Feeding America in the vital mission to alleviate hunger in our communities," said Reza Soltanzadeh, CEO of Borealis. “At Borealis, we believe that access to nourishing food is a fundamental human right, and this initiative exemplifies our dedication to creating positive change."

Other well-known brands participating in the campaign include Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ: KHC), Kellogg’s (NYSE: KLG) and Hellmann’s.
