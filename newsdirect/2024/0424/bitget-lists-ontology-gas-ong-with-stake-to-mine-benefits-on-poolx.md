# Bitget Lists Ontology Gas (ONG) with Stake-to-Mine Benefits on PoolX

--News Direct--

Bitget, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange and Web3 company, has announced the listing of Ontonlogy network’s gas token called ONG on its PoolX platform. Under the public chain sector in Innovation zone, ONG will provide incentives over $20,000 to users staking tokens. Users can stake to mine tokens on PoolX, mining period is currently live and will run up to 8:00 (UTC), 4th May, 2024.

Each PoolX project features one or more mining pools, with token rewards distributed hourly based on participants’ staking volume. Hourly snapshots of staked amounts will be taken to ensure accurate calculations of users’ proportionate shares and rewards. Each mining pool on PoolX calculates its Annual Percentage Rate (APR) separately, providing users with diverse opportunities to maximize their token earnings. Furthermore, users enjoy the flexibility to redeem the staked tokens at any time, with staked assets automatically returning to their spot accounts after the mining period ends.

The high speed, low cost public blockchain brings decentralized identity and data solutions to Web3. The layer 2 blockchain is designed to give users and enterprises the flexibility to build blockchain-based solutions, while also ensuring regulatory compliance. Through Ontology’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Ontology ensures frictionless compatibility with Ethereum, the first step in the creation of the Ontology Multi-Virtual Machine and further interoperability for the chain.

With a suite of decentralized identity and data sharing protocols to enhance speed, security, and trust, Ontology’s features include ONT ID, a mobile digital ID application and DID used throughout the ecosystem, and DDXF, a decentralized data exchange, and collaboration framework.

Ontology adopts a dual-token model, with both ONT and ONG as utility tokens. Ontology decouples ONT and ONG to alleviate the risk of turbulent fluctuations of the native “asset” value on the gas fee. ONT is used as the staking tool and the time, cost of staking and operating costs of the nodes are considered to be inputs. ONG is used as a value-anchoring tool for on-chain applications and is used in the transactions on the chain.

Bitget lists high potential tokens in its innovation zone to provide improved accessibility to emerging DeFi ecosystems. The inclusion of ONG in Bitget’s spot helps users engage in the initial launch phases of the trending high potential low-cap tokens.

With a focus on providing users with opportunities to invest in popular and valuable projects, the platfrom is now one of the top 10 crypto spot trading platforms with over 700 coins and 800 pairs, including BTC, ETH, SOL and more.
