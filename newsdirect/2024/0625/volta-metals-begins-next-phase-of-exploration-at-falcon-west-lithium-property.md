# Volta Metals begins next phase of exploration at Falcon West Lithium Property

Volta Metals CEO Kerem Usenmez joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce the commencement of the 2024 exploration campaign at the company's northwestern Ontario properties, including the Falcon West Lithium Property. This property yielded promising results in the last round of exploration, with ten out of eleven diamond drill holes intersecting multiple broad zones of high-grade lithium mineralization. Highlighted results included 1.24% Li2O over 15.6 metres, 1.11% Li2O over 10.2 meters and 1.50% Li2O over 5.15 meters

Usenmez detailed that the 2024 exploration program will involve systematic soil sampling, trenching, and detailed structural geology work. Initial soil sampling will focus on targets generated from a detailed magnetic survey and 2023 soil sampling. This program aims to screen highly prospective target areas around the newly discovered high-grade lithium pegmatite swarm.

The first phase of exploration will take place at the Junior Lake project, involving the collection of surface exploration data, including structural and alteration mapping, prospecting, sampling, and utilizing a handheld Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscope for rapid real-time sample analysis to support field follow-up.

These efforts underscore Volta Metals' strategic focus on advancing its exploration activities and enhancing its resource base in the highly prospective lithium-rich regions of northwestern Ontario.
