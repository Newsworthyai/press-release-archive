# Superlab Suisse opens state-of-the-art facility in Basel, fostering new spaces for scientific breakthroughs

For life sciences and biotech companies, access to affordable dedicated lab spaces is hard to come by. Labs are prohibitively expensive to build and operate, posing significant financial barriers to innovation and research.

A cutting-edge new alternative is being offered by Superlab Suisse, a leading provider of innovative laboratory and research spaces that today announces the grand opening of its newest facility in Basel. With this new facility, Superlab Suisse becomes the largest private lab space in Switzerland.

Opening in July 2024, following the success of the Lausanne location supported by Biopôle Lausanne and InnoVaud, the expansion marks a significant milestone in Superlab Suisse's mission to provide research infrastructure to Switzerland's dynamic life sciences sector.

Forging ahead with its successful partnership with Swiss Prime Site, Superlab Suisse is set to open the door for huge commercial opportunities in the ideally suited location of Basel, a booming biotechnology hub and home to over 700 companies including pharmaceutical giants like Novartis and Roche.

The new facility, nestled within the bustling Stücki Park with neighbours like Tech Park Basel, Lonza, Medartis, NBE, and Boehringer Ingelheim, offers ready-to-use laboratory spaces equipped with the latest technology and essential operational support services, allowing teams to channel their resources into scientific research rather than lab operations. Spanning over 4770 square metres, it promises to be a nucleus of scientific collaboration and breakthrough, redefining laboratory services in Basel.

"We are thrilled to bring Superlab Suisse's innovative platform to Basel, the city of Pharma," says Xi Zhang, CEO of Superlab Suisse. “Our holistic solution frees scientists from operations headaches, so they can save time and focus on science. We service, you discover”.

Life sciences and biotech companies have until now lacked the widely accepted lab solutions that have benefitted industries such as tech and finance. Universities have typically been the only viable option, with lab construction and operation requiring significant upfront investments — costs which redirect attention away from research and delay progress in getting products to market.

Superlab Suisse's serviced BSL1 and BSL2 labs provide a new industry standard of lab solution. Users in one location such as Basel also gain access to facilities in Lausanne and other locations. By delivering ready to move in lab solutions for life science companies of all sizes, including startups, scale-ups, and corporates, Superlab Suisse eliminates the hurdles of lab construction and operation. One of the first companies to secure their space at the opening is Skyhawk Therapeutics, which has recently announced a research collaboration with Ipsen focusing on RNA targeting in rare neurological diseases.

In addition to the Basel location, Superlab Suisse continues its commitment to innovation with plans for a third site in Zurich Schlieren. This new facility, scheduled to open in March 2025, will cater to the diverse needs of start-ups, spin-offs, and established companies in the life sciences sector, further solidifying Superlab Suisse's position as a leader in laboratory-as-a-service solutions.

This one-stop solution not only solves the true problems of life science companies but also attracts like-minded innovators to meet and collaborate. Superlab is expanding this year to more cities in Europe, the US, and Asia, embodying a borderless lab concept because life science benefits humanity as a whole.

Dr. Rajwinder Lehal, CEO of biotech business Cellestia commented: “Superlab is exactly the place which the scientific community needs, where we can concentrate on our work without being distracted by construction or operation. Superlab provided us with state of the art infrastructure and equipment that we needed to hit the ground running from day 1.”

Emmanuel Savioz, CEO & Chairman, Tigen Pharma commented: “Superlab is a great place to work in a vibrant scientific community. Our team at Tigen can focus on growth, supported by state-of-the-art facilities, latest equipment and a competent and fun Superlab team to support on-site”.
