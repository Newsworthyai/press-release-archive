Dr. Michael Lebby, chairperson and CEO of Lightwave Logic, Inc. (NASDAQ: LWLG), was recently a guest on Benzinga’s All-Access.

Lightwave Logic develops proprietary engineered electro-optic (EO) polymers. The company’s high-activity, high-stability organic polymers allow it to create next-generation photonic EO devices, which convert data from electrical signals into optical signals – critical to the functioning of the Internet. This means that with the company’s technology, more data gets sent faster using less power than the current standard, the company reports.

Lebby spoke about the increasing demand for faster data transmission required by AI and how his company’s tech is uniquely positioned to provide a solution.
