# Linacre Investments Launches Offshore Feeder Funds in South Africa

Linacre Investments has announced a major initiative to provide South African investors with unparalleled access to international investment opportunities. This strategic development, enabled through partnerships with prominent South African banks, includes the introduction of offshore feeder funds. These funds simplify the process of diversifying portfolios globally by eliminating the need for SARS tax clearance certificates.

Introducing Asset Swap Capacity

Central to this initiative is Linacre Investments’ new asset swap capacity, a sophisticated financial mechanism that enables South African investors to access offshore investments without using their personal discretionary allowances. Asset swap capacity allows investors to leverage Linacre’s institutional offshore allowances, overcoming regulatory barriers and streamlining access to global markets.

Through this facility, clients transfer funds in ZAR to Linacre Investments, which then facilitates the conversion and allocation of these funds into international investments denominated in USD, EUR, or GBP. This process adheres strictly to South African Reserve Bank (SARB) regulations while significantly reducing administrative burdens for investors.

Diversifying Beyond the Rand

This initiative provides South African investors with a powerful tool to hedge against the volatility of the rand by holding funds in stable foreign currencies. The offshore feeder funds offer access to a range of opportunities, including capital-protected international bonds with attractive fixed returns.

For those seeking higher growth, Linacre Investments also facilitates access to private equity opportunities, allowing clients to invest in companies with significant growth potential before they list on public markets.

Addressing Growing Demand

The launch of these offshore feeder funds is timely, addressing a surge in demand for global diversification amid South Africa’s economic and currency challenges. Linacre Investments asset swap facility provides a streamlined and compliant pathway for investors to safeguard and grow their wealth internationally.

Strengthening Partnerships and Operations

Linacre’s collaboration with leading South African banks ensures robust operational support for the feeder funds. These partnerships will enable the company to scale its services to accommodate increased demand while maintaining compliance with both local and international financial regulations.

A Leader in Global Wealth Management

This initiative cements Linacre Investments position as a leader in the global wealth management sector. By offering innovative solutions that reduce reliance on the volatile rand and unlock access to global markets, Linacre is helping clients within South Africa achieve financial security and growth.
