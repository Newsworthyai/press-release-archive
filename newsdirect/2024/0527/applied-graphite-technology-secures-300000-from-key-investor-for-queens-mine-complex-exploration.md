# Applied Graphite Technology Secures $300,000 from key investor for Queens Mine Complex Exploration

Applied Graphite Technology Corporation CEO Don Baxter joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce a significant milestone for the company. Applied Graphite has closed a non-brokered private placement with a strategic investor for $300,000. The net proceeds will be used for the exploration of the Queens Mine Complex graphite project.

Baxter discussed ongoing efforts at the Queen's Mine complex in Sri Lanka, including permitting and rapid progress towards obtaining mining licenses. The company aims to start production by mid to late fall, focusing on extracting high-purity graphite (95% carbon) without the need for extensive processing facilities. This natural graphite is essential for lithium-ion batteries, particularly for the anode component, and has a smaller environmental footprint compared to synthetic graphite.

The high quality and low capital expenditure of Applied Graphite Technologies' product make it attractive for the battery industry, including applications in electric vehicles and stationary storage. Baxter highlighted the proven effectiveness of their graphite in battery anodes, reinforcing the company's strategic importance in the market.
