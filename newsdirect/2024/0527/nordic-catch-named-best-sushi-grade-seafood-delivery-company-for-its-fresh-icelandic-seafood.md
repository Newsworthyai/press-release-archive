Another appreciable difference that Nordic Catch has in the provision and selling of its seafood is its methods of ensuring that the foods retain their fresh nature. To stand out from some of the other competitors, the company guarantees that its seafood is not frozen in any way, thus maintaining the authentic qualities, such as taste and texture, that sushi lovers appreciate. “Currently, we have been the only statewide company that delivers fresh Icelandic seafood every time,” stated Julian Plateado of Nordic Catch. In our process, we ensure that every customer serving is given the best Seafood possible, at their doorstep.

Iceland, famous for wealthy sea-living organisms, uses its fresh waters to produce quality seafood. From the case study looking at Nordic Catch, it is evident that the company supplies a range of fish and shellfish that boast the appropriate quality necessary for sushi-grade products. Thus, it fosters sustainability and provides consumers with a product that meets their expectations due to its freshness and taste.

Nordic Catch received the title of “Best Sushi Grade Seafood Delivery Company” because of the satisfaction rate and quality of the product in terms of freshness as well as the unique delivery services that ensure that seafood remains fresh even after delivery. Out of 11 seafood delivery services highlighted by Food Network, Nordic Catch was singled out for ranking high in their specific category. This title, the spokesperson stated, ‘must reflect the efforts of the team’ and the respect for the ‘generous nature’ of Iceland. After receiving this high accreditation, Nordic Catch should be able to diversify and offer new products as well as tap into more markets of people desiring to enjoy the best quality seafood. They continue to remain committed to their vision of making sure that their products produce the best quality and that consuming fresh fish is good for your health.
