# Nextech3D.ai's Q1 Performance: Enhancing Profitability Through Strategic Measures

Nextech3D.ai CEO Evan Gappelberg joined Steve Darling from Proactive to discuss the company's Q1 performance. Despite a slight drop in revenue, Gappelberg highlighted a significant improvement in the company's profit margin, which rose from 30% in Q1 2023 to an impressive 51% in Q1 2024. This notable enhancement is attributed to aggressive cost reduction measures, including the relocation of operations to India. Monthly expenses decreased from $2.2 million to $850,000, with further reductions anticipated in Q2.

Gappelberg underscored the importance of enterprise customers, particularly mentioning Nextech3D.ai's largest client, Amazon, and the addition of new enterprise clients. The company continues to excel in 3D modelling, delivering thousands of models monthly. Recent expansions include the introduction of a new AI-powered 3D model search engine, an expanded AR tech team in Hyderabad, and an entry into the jewellery industry.

Moreover, Nextech3D.ai launched an AI technology incubator and obtained pivotal patents for generating 3D models from 2D images. Gappelberg emphasized that while Q1 revenue was modest, the company's focus remains on long-term profitability. Nextech3D.ai aims to secure five large enterprise deals, which are anticipated to drive future growth. Gappelberg expressed confidence in their strategic approach and extended gratitude to shareholders for their ongoing support.
