# Intra Energy Corporation approved for lithium and gold drilling at Maggie Hays Hills

Intra Energy Corporation Ltd (ASX: IEC) managing director Ben Dunn sits down with Proactiveâ€™s Jonathan Jackson after the WA Department of Energy, Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety (DEMIRS) approved IEC's Program of Works (PoW). The company now plans to conduct 2,500 metres of reverse circulation (RC) drilling for lithium, tantalum, niobium and caesium pegmatites at the Maggie Hays Hills Project in Western Australia. These pegmatites are believed to be up to 50 metres wide, with outcroppings along a 2.5-kilometre contact zone. Additionally, IEC aims to drill test several outcropping quartz reefs, where rock chip samples have shown gold results of up to 17 g/t, extending over a 1.5-kilometre geological contact zone. According to Dunn, the approval is a significant step towards the drilling phase, with multiple promising lithium pegmatite and gold targets identified. IEC is collaborating with the Ngadju Native Title Group to secure the necessary heritage clearance, expected to be surveyed by late May, with drilling anticipated to start by mid-June, pending clearance. Pending laboratory assays for 50 infill soil samples and 12 rock samples are expected within the next two weeks. The heritage survey is scheduled for May 30, 2024, and track clearing at Maggie Hays is planned for early June.
