# HTX Unveils ETH Trading Contest: Enhancing Focus and Support for the Ethereum Ecosystem

The U.S. SEC has approved the 19b-4 forms for eight Spot Ether ETFs. To celebrate this historic milestone in the crypto sphere, HTX is launching a trading contest featuring ETH and related cryptocurrencies on May 24. By trading designated cryptos in spot and margin, participants have the chance to share in a prize pool of 10,000 USDT. HTX has been a staunch supporter and promoter of innovation and development within the Ethereum ecosystem. Through this trading contest, the platform aims to contribute to the continuous growth and expansion of the Ethereum ecosystem.

According to HTX's official announcement, the event will last from 12:00 (UTC) on May 24, 2024, to 12:00 (UTC) on May 31, 2024, with applicable cryptos including ETH, ONDO, PEPE, WOJACK, PEOPLE, TURBO, ENS, SSV, PENDLE, and BANANA.

By trading these 10 designated cryptos in spot and margin during the event period, participants will be eligible to split a 10,000 USDT prize pool based on their spot and margin trading volumes, with the potential to earn up to 2,000 individually. Throughout the event, users who visit the event page on any given day will be automatically enrolled in the event, and their trading volume during the event period will be calculated. It is worth mentioning that participants engaging in margin trading for ETH/USDT, ONDO/USDT, PEPE/USDT, PEOPLE/USDT, and PENDLE/USDT will have their trading volume multiplied by 3 times for this event.

The SEC has given the green light for the listing of several Spot Ether ETFs on U.S. stock exchanges, approving the asset managers' 19b-4 forms on May 23 (UTC), including those from BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale. In addition, there are another six spot Ethereum ETFs awaiting approval.

HTX has highlighted that the approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs marks a new milestone for the crypto space, occurring over four months after the approval of Spot BTC ETFs. This progress is expected to drive the crypto market to new all-time highs. HTX has consistently monitored and supported the development of the Ethereum ecosystem, committed to growing alongside this innovative technology. Looking forward, the platform will remain a steadfast supporter and active participant in the Ethereum ecosystem, collaborating with the global community to explore and unlock the infinite opportunities of Web3.
