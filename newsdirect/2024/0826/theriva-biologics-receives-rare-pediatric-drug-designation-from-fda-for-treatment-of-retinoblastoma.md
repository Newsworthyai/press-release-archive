The growing prevalence of cancer is not limited to adults; it is also afflicting children. An estimated 15,780 children between birth and 19 years of age are diagnosed with cancer each year in the U.S., according to the American Childhood Cancer Organization.

Approximately 1 in 285 children in the U.S. will be diagnosed with cancer before their 20th birthday. Globally, there are more than 300,000 children diagnosed with cancer each year, and the rate of childhood cancer is slowly rising; cancer cases increased to 177 per million in 2019 from 165 per million in 2003.

Recently, Theriva Biologics (AMEX: TOVX), the clinical-stage immuno-oncology company developing therapies for difficult-to-treat cancers, was granted Rare Pediatric Drug Designation (RPDD) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for VCN-01 for the treatment of retinoblastoma; the most common type of eye cancer in children.

Retinoblastoma Presents Significant Treatment ChallengesRetinoblastoma is a tumor that originates in the retina and accounts for approximately 2% of all childhood cancers. Some 200 to 300 children are diagnosed each year in the U.S., and the cancer is most common among infants and young children. The average age of a child when diagnosed is two years of age.

Approximately three out of four children with retinoblastoma have a tumor in only one eye (known as unilateral retinoblastoma). When both eyes are affected it is known as bilateral retinoblastoma.

Although the chances of developing retinoblastoma are statistically low, the challenge of preserving life while preventing the loss of an eye, blindness, and other severe consequences that diminish both lifespan and quality of life remains significant. Furthermore, in low-resource countries, children with retinoblastoma face a higher risk of losing their eyes and succumbing to metastatic disease.

Recently, market research and industry consulting firm Spherical Insights assessed the global retinoblastoma treatment market size to be $2.5 billion in 2023; and it is expected to grow to $3.8 billion by 2033.

Rare Pediatric Drug Designation For VCN-01As the name suggests, the Rare Pediatric Drug Designation is a special status given to drugs explicitly developed for treating rare diseases that affect children. This designation is part of a broader effort to encourage the development of medications for conditions not commonly addressed due to the small number of patients, particularly in the pediatric population.

For Theriva Biologics, this designation comes with a key incentive: if a Biologics License Application for VCN-01 for the treatment of retinoblastoma is approved by the FDA, Theriva says it may be eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher (PRV) that can be redeemed to receive a priority review for any subsequent marketing application or may be transferred or sold. PRVs have previously been sold by different companies for around $100M.

“The FDA’s decision to grant rare pediatric drug designation to VCN-01 highlights the urgent need for new treatment options for pediatric patients with retinoblastoma. We are encouraged by this important step forward and, in parallel, continue to work closely with leading physicians and regulatory agencies to refine our clinical strategy for VCN-01 as an adjunct to chemotherapy in pediatric patients with advanced retinoblastoma,” said Steven A. Shallcross, CEO of Theriva Biologics.

“Most recently, results from the investigator-sponsored Phase 1 trial evaluating the safety and activity of intravitreal VCN-01 in pediatric patients with refractory retinoblastoma were determined to be positive by the study Monitoring Committee. Data from this study will further inform our clinical development pathway in this area of high unmet need,” he said.

With VCN-01 receiving RPDD from the U.S. FDA, this milestone speaks to the drug's efficacy and long-run potential. As such, the social benefit that Theriva Biologics provides could continue to grow and have increased industry resonance.
