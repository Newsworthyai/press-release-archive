# Minerva Surgical Launches Next Generation Symphion Fluid Management Accessory with Fluid Deficit Readout

Minerva Surgical, a manufacturer and distributor of minimally invasive gynecologic surgical technologies, today announced the launch of the Symphion Fluid Deficit Readout, an optional accessory that provides fluid deficit volume readings during operative hysteroscopy procedures.

Operative hysteroscopy is a surgical procedure that requires precise fluid management to prevent complications. The Symphion Fluid Deficit Readout, which is intended for use with the Symphion Operative Hysteroscopy System, automatically calculates the fluid deficit during the procedure by measuring the weight of the saline bag throughout the procedure in real time and converting the weight measurement into fluid volume readings.

Additional key features of the Symphion Fluid Deficit Readout include a fluid deficit accuracy within +/- 50mL, a user-friendly interface with an intuitive display for easy operation, and a compact design that allows for quick set up with the Symphion controller.

“Continuous innovation with a focus on enhancing patient safety has always been the primary objective for Minerva Surgical. The Symphion Operative Hysteroscopy System is intended to volumetrically limit a patient’s exposure to fluid so the risk of fluid absorption and overload can be avoided. With the introduction of the Symphion Fluid Deficit Readout, the system has a new layer of procedural safety to complement the unprecedented precision during uterine cavity tissue resection.”, states Minerva Surgical Chief Medical Officer Eugene Skalnyi, M.D.

Along with the Symphion Fluid Deficit Readout, Minerva Surgical is launching a compatible, next generation of Fluid Management Accessory called INFINITY. Together, the Symphion line extensions are the newest additions to the Minerva Surgical portfolio of minimally invasive technologies. The company is committed to advancing gynecologic surgery and providing solutions that enhance outcomes.
