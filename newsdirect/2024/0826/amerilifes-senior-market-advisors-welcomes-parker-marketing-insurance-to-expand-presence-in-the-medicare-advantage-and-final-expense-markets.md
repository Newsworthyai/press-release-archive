# AmeriLife’s Senior Market Advisors Welcomes 
Parker Marketing Insurance to Expand Presence in the Medicare Advantage and Final Expense Markets

Senior Market Advisors (SMA), a fast-growing field marketing organization (FMO) in the insurance space and an affiliate of AmeriLife Group, LLC (“AmeriLife”), announced today that it has completed its acquisition of Parker Marketing Insurance (“PMI”). Per the agreement, terms of the deal were not disclosed.

“Daniel [Parker] and his team represent the kind of customer-focused care that we promote in every interaction our affiliated agents and agencies have with their clients,” said Joshua Borders, CEO of Senior Market Advisors. “This partnership represents our shared values in meeting people where they are in their health insurance journey and helping them safeguard their assets for some of life’s unexpected events.”

Inspired by his experiences and what he learned from his father, Parker established his first insurance agency in 2016, focused on replicating a successful final expense business into the Medicare Advantage market. This pivotal decision led to PMI’s Legacy Chassis—a primary brokerage model that benefits agents through a tiered lump sum model, enhancing recruitment efforts.

“AmeriLife’s distribution platform offers robust layers of professionalism to ensure success for PMI’s agents and customers,” said Daniel Parker, owner and president of Parker Marketing Insurance. “This partnership will fuel my long-term vision, allowing me to continue my life’s work for the people I serve, enabling continued growth, and enhancing agent success emphasized by the power and unity of AmeriLife’s core values that prioritize the needs and success of others.”

PMI’s growing, nationwide agent network—specifically, across the southeast in Mississippi, Georgia, and Florida—is a testament to its focus and dedication to talent acquisition and best-in-class training protocols, which have developed some of the region’s top producers.

AmeriLife provides partners with a business environment and distribution network characterized by efficiency, value, and access to teams of dedicated professionals working together to enhance their platform with productivity and profitability. This proves especially advantageous for companies like PMI focused on the Medicare and final expense sectors, where consumers search for peace of mind and customized solutions to address their healthcare needs and end-of-life expenses.

"Seeing our collaboration with Senior Market Advisors flourish through the years, and now with the inclusion of Parker Marketing Insurance, is exciting," added Scotty Elliott, Chief Distribution Officer of Health for AmeriLife. "This expansion highlights the robust nature of our expanding Health Distribution network, enabling us to assist more beneficiaries and establish new benchmarks in top-tier customer service within the industry."
