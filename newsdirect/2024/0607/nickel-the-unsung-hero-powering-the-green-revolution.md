Nickel is a critical component of many modern technologies and with the recent discovery that adding more nickel to EV batteries increases their drivable range, energy transition-related demand for this critical mineral may increase nearly significantly over the coming decades.

Sprott Asset Management, a leader in critical mineral investing, offers the Sprott Nickel Miners ETF (NASDAQ: NIKL). The ETF seeks to provide investment results that generally correspond to the total return performance of the Nasdaq Sprott Nickel Minersâ„¢ Index, an index designed to track the performance of a selection of global securities in the nickel industry, including nickel producers, developers and explorers.

NIKL can provide exposure for investors looking to ride the green wave.
