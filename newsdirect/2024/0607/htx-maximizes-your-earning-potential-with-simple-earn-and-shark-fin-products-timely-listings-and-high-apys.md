# HTX Maximizes Your Earning Potential with Simple Earn and Shark Fin Products: Timely Listings and High APYs

As the spot Ethereum ETF receives approval, Bitcoin surpasses $70,000, and popular meme coins continue to emerge, the cryptocurrency market is signaling the start of a bull run. According to CoinMarketCap data, spot trading volume and futures open interest have been climbing in recent days. Accordingly, crypto earning products often provide higher annualized returns than usual, making them a crucial avenue for investors to boost their yields beyond trading.

However, with a wide variety of crypto earning products available in the market, how can investors find the most suitable options? Now, let's turn our attention to the lucrative products of Simple Earn and Shark Fin, designed by HTX, the world-leading crypto exchange, to meet the investment needs of different users.

Simple Earn: Trend-Following Listings

HTX not only ensures high quality and fast listing of new coins but also keeps its Earn products updated with the market trends. According to HTX's official announcements, the latest additions to its Flexible products include BB, a favorite in the Restaking sector, and trending meme coins, such as GME, SLOTH, and MAGA, granting users up to 10% APY.

Currently, the Flexible products feature more than 30 popular assets, including PEPE, BOME, MERL, and WIF, allowing users to enjoy the appreciation of these quality cryptocurrencies while harvesting extra rewards. Additionally, these products support instant subscriptions and redemptions for flexibly allocating assets with the best investment opportunities. Subscription is easy: for web clients, simply log in to the HTX platform and select Earn > Flexible/Fixed from the top navigation bar; for app clients, access Earn > Simple Earn on the homepage.

Shark Fin: High Basic APY

Shark Fin products are offered by many exchanges, but HTX stands out with its attractive basic APY. As of press, HTX’s 7-day Shark Fin APY ranges from 5.5% to 35%, where each individual can make a subscription of up to 3 million USDT; the 3-day Shark Fin APY from 5.5% to 30%. In comparison, a leading exchange’s 7-day and 3-day Shark Fin APYs range only 5.5%-15% and 1%-6%, respectively.

Already, HTX has issued 38 rounds of 7-day Shark Fin and 25 rounds of 3-day Shark Fin, with a total subscription amount reaching $2 billion. Besides high returns, HTX’s Shark Fin boasts an Auto Reinvest feature for effortless subscriptions. With this feature enabled easily, investments in both 3-day and 7-day products can be automatically re-invested into the corresponding 7-day products, making your funds work till you drop for return maximization. Moreover, subscribing to both the bullish and bearish products of the same cryptocurrency will reward you with up to 10% APY, 4% higher than the basic APY. To make subscriptions, go to the Earn page when the subscription is open, click on Structured Products, and select Shark Fin.
