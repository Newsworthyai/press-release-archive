Older adults are especially vulnerable to loneliness and social isolation, which can have a serious effect on health, according to a recent report issued by the U.S. Surgeon General.

Chronic loneliness (persistent feelings of isolation and/or a lack of companionship) can adversely affect mental, cognitive, and physical health, general well-being and even longevity.

However, there are ways to overcome loneliness and volunteering might be the answer.

AmeriCorps Seniors is helping older adults form connections in their community, provide purpose and improve their lives through volunteering.

After two years of volunteering with AmeriCorps Seniors, 78% of those who reported more than five symptoms of depression at the beginning of the study said that they felt less depressed two years later. Of those who first described a lack of companionship, 88% said they felt less isolated after two years.

AmeriCorps is the federal agency for national service and volunteerism. AmeriCorps Seniors focuses on engaging adults ages 55 and up in service in their local communities. Through three signature programs, RSVP, the Foster Grandparent Program and the Senior Companion Program, AmeriCorps Seniors provides a space for older adults to take charge of this moment in life and use their time in impactful ways.

Each year, AmeriCorps Seniors matches more than 140,000 Americans with service opportunities.

For example, Shelley Brosnan, a volunteer with AmeriCorps Seniors RSVP through Volunteer Fairfax, Fairfax, Va., said, “Giving back is so very important. I’ve been volunteering for most of my adult life. Volunteering allows me to connect with my community and make it a better place. I also love the social aspects and meeting people who share my interests. We have a chance to help others and form new relationships, which has grown my social circle.”

RSVP offers flexible scheduling and a diverse mix of opportunities. The Foster Grandparent Program pairs volunteers with children and youth in mentoring and tutoring relationships. Lastly, the Senior Companion Program provides a helping hand to other older adults and those with disabilities. They also support caregivers through respite services.
