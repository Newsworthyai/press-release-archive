# HTX Shines at GM Vietnam 2024 and Hosts Web3 Future Night: Spotlighting Crypto Trends, Advancing Global Expansion

HTX, the world-leading crypto exchange, made a noteworthy appearance at GM Vietnam 2024 as a gold sponsor on June 7. This strategic move marks a significant step in HTX's global expansion efforts, as close connections and cooperations were formed with local blockchain startups, tech teams, and the crypto communities to drive technological innovation and contribute to the growth of the blockchain ecosystem, both in Vietnam and globally.

At the event, HTX's booth G6 attracted widespread attention and active engagement from attendees. Additionally, Amelia Chan, head of strategic partnerships at HTX, was invited to participate in a roundtable discussion, themed "Importance of Liquidity in Digital Assets Markets". Chan dived into the measures exchange venues employ to ensure a constant stream of asset flows.

Crypto markets are volatile and susceptible to large price swings and abnormal conditions. Chan stated that as a well-established large centralized exchange, HTX has mature experience and resources in dealing with such situations. "We ensure the safety of user assets on the platform, and we maintain a 100% reserve fund to cope with extreme situations. We have implemented powerful risk management systems that monitor market conditions in real-time and identify potential risks," she said. She also highlighted HTX's strict measures in response to extreme conditions, such as price fluctuations, to ensure user asset security. HTX is committed to providing a safe and reliable user experience and continuously monitors and adapts to changing market dynamics.

In terms of using digital asset platforms, Chan provided several reminders including enabling two-factor authentication, awareness of phishing websites, staying informed about market dynamics, as well as cautious and diversified investments.

Another highlight was the "Web3 Future Night" event held by HTX in Ho Chi Minh City on June 6, in collaboration with well-known media outlet ChainCatcher. The party, buzzing with energy and optimism, brought together Vietnamâ€™s most active crypto KOLs and community members, charting a promising future for Vietnamese Web3 enthusiasts and practitioners.

Speakers from HTX, ChainCatcher, LBank, 4E, GoPlus, SOEX, and BTC Beta shared their insights and forward-thinking perspectives on the Web3 industry.

GM Vietnam 2024, held from June 7 to 8 in Ho Chi Minh City, gathered globally renowned crypto projects, investors, entrepreneurs, and tech experts to discuss the latest trends and uncover new growth opportunities in the market.

HTX has set its sights on the Vietnamese Web3 markets. The move comes amidst a surge of Web3 projects in Vietnam, sparked by wildly popular Axie Infinity in 2021 and subsequently influential startups like Yield Guild Games (YGG) and Ancient 8. That's why Vietnam is rapidly becoming a focal point for the Web3 ecosystem in Asia. HTX holds long-standing interest and support for cutting-edge sectors like meme coins, blockchain gaming, and social finance, and is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend with its efforts to increase user base in Vietnamese markets. The exchange anticipates collaborating with Vietnamese users to explore the crypto infinity.
