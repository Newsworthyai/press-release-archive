# HTX Ventures Announces Investment in NexGami to Develop GameFi Ecosystem

Singapore / June 3, 2024 – In a move that underscores its commitment to broadening the reach and usability of Web3 technologies, HTX Ventures, the global investment arm of the cryptocurrency exchange HTX, has announced a strategic investment in NexGami, a pioneering Web3 gaming platform.

NexGami is a Web3 gaming platform aiming to be the prime venue for hosting competitive gaming events across various titles. Their recently raised $2.5 million seed round will be instrumental in advancing NexGami’s platform. NexGami’s mission is to integrate traditional gamers into the Web3 ecosystem, providing tangible benefits through tokenomics. The platform will offer seamless integration for game developers, enabling users to organize tournaments, players to compete for rewards, and content creators to share their gaming experiences.

"HTX Ventures is always looking for innovative projects that lower the gateway of Web3 entrance, not only for the retail user but also for businesses. By releasing games like MetaMyth and onboarding traditional gaming projects on-chain, NexGami is introducing more people into Web3 through gaming. HTX Ventures is excited to support their journey in transforming the gaming landscape through Web3," said Edward, Managing Partner of HTX Ventures.

"We are immensely grateful for the support from our investors, which will enable us to accelerate our development and bring our vision of a revolutionary Web3 gaming platform to life," said Brice Bian, Founder and CEO of NexGami.

NexGami debuted its $NEXG token recently at the end of May, with the token listing coming up on HTX along with this seed round announcement.
