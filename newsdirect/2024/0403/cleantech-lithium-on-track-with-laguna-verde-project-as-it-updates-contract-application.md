# CleanTech Lithium on track with Laguna Verde project as it updates contract application

--News Direct--

CleanTech Lithium PLC CEO Aldo Boitano tells Proactive's Stephen Gunnion the company has updated its applications for Special Lithium Operating Contracts for its Laguna Verde and Francisco projects in Chile.

This action followed an announcement by the Chilean government regarding the process and criteria for awarding lithium extraction rights to private entities. This necessitated adjustments to the current rules, prompting CleanTech Lithium to resubmit applications for the projects.

Boitano highlighted a productive meeting with Chile's mining ministry, noting the company's compliance with the necessary criteria, including community engagement and detailed project planning.

Despite the resubmission, Boitano assured that the project timeline remains unaffected, with indigenous consultations and contract details being the next steps. He outlined key milestones for investors in 2024, including government acknowledgment of interest in April and May, potential indigenous consultations in June, and the hopeful acceleration of the awarding process.
