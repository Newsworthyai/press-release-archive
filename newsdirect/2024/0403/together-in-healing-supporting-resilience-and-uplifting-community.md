ACE Resource Network‘s initiative, Together in Healing, which launched in February, is making strides in supporting people affected by childhood trauma. With goals of fostering community resilience and empowering people with resources and support, the campaign is well underway with a host of outreach efforts centered in Sacramento.

Messages of healing and hope can be spotted on billboards, bus stops, and bus tails throughout Sacramento County and online, leveraging partnerships with Tribune, iHeart, and FizzyLabs. A partnership with Bloggin’ Mamas is mobilizing bloggers and influencers to share the campaign’s message in Sacramento and nationwide.

In an upcoming Instagram Live session on @MyNumberStory on Thursday, April 4, 2024 at 9 p.m. ET / 6 p.m. PT, ACE Resource Network will welcome guest host and internationally renowned clinical psychologist, trauma specialist, and author Dr. Edith Shiro to discuss topics related to healing from childhood trauma. This session will serve as an opportunity for individuals to connect directly with Dr. Shiro, ask questions, and engage with community. Copies of her book, The Unexpected Gift of Trauma: The Path to Posttraumatic Growth, will be given away during the event.

An influencer video campaign designed to provide deeper insights into healing strategies launches later this month. By sharing personal narratives and resources, the campaign intends to inspire and educate, offering hope and practical, evidence-based advice to those on healing journeys.

The influencer campaign culminates May 2nd with an informational and interactive “Coffee Con Conchas” event to be held at Vizcaya Sacramento, where attendees will have the opportunity to experience activities that reduce stress and boost resilience, supporting healing from the effects of early adversity. This intimate gathering will equip influencers with knowledge and tools to share effective coping strategies with their families and communities, including their followers, helping to further amplify the message.

“It’s our hope that the Together in Healing campaign encourages conversation and connection to resources among people seeking to address the challenging effects of childhood trauma and adversity,” said Joy Thomas, Director of Communications and Community Engagement for ACE Resource Network. “We’re excited to offer opportunities for community connection and to share tools that we know can help us heal.”
