# Intra Energy Corporation discovers further lithium anomalies

--News Direct--

Intra Energy Corporation Ltd (ASX:IEC) managing director Ben Dunn joins Proactiveâ€™s Jonathan Jackson to discuss the discovery of further significant lithium anomalies at the Maggie Hays Hill Project in Western Australia. Dunn highlights the identification of two large-scale lithium targets within the Lake Johnston Greenstone Belt. Spanning 2,500 metres by 300 metres and 1,300 metres by 300 metres, these targets have shown high lithium oxide values, peaking at 248ppm. Additionally, they exhibit strong indications of caesium and tantalum, essential for pegmatite exploration in spodumene-rich zones. Intra Energy is set to start an RC drilling program in the June quarter, pending necessary heritage and regulatory consents. The company is finalising a heritage survey with the Ngadju Native Title Aboriginal Corporation to establish drilling sites.
