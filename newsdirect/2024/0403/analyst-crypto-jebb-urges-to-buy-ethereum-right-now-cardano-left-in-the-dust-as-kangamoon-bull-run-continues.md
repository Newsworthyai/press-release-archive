Renowned analyst Crypto Jebb has been talking about Ethereum (ETH) a lot lately and people are starting to listen. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) has been outshined by many altcoins like KangaMoon (KANG), which is on a massive bull run. This Stage 5 presale star has already provided early buyers with 291% ROI, causing many experts to hint at a $0.5 price in 2024.

Crypto Jebb: Ethereum Price Will MoonshotRecently, Ethereum (ETH) has been on an uptrend. Over the past 30 days, the Ethereum price soared from $3,409 to $3,557. During that time, its market cap increased from $410B to $427B. According to crypto analyst Crypto Jebb, this bullish trend will continue for the Ethereum crypto. He forecasts a potential 10x on ETH within the next ten years.

This altcoin's technical analysis also shows a bullish future. For instance, Ethereum is now trading above its 100â€” and 200-day EMAs. Additionally, 25 technical indicators are showing green for ETH. As a result, experts have made a bullish Ethereum price prediction. They foresee this altcoin's price hitting $4,489 within Q2 of 2024.

Cardano (ADA): Trading in the RedOn the other hand, Cardano (ADA) has been trading in the red. According to CoinMarketCap data, the Cardano price sank from $0.73 to $0.63 over the past month. In that period, its market cap also fell from $26B to $22.46B.

However, the technical analysis for this altcoin paints a different picture. Notably, the Cardano coin is trading above its 100 and 200-day EMAs. Additionally, this altcoin now has over 20 technical indicators showing bullish signs. Due to all these reasons, market analysts have made a bullish Cardano price prediction - a rise to $0.86 within Q2 of 2024.

KangaMoon (KANG): Becoming One of the Altcoins To WatchWhile Ethereum and Cardano experience ups and downs, KangaMoon (KANG) has surfaced as an unexpected contender. This presale star has already soared by 291%, with 20,000 registered community members. Moreover, KangaMoon has raised over $3.9M and projects reaching $5M before April 2024 ends.

Essentially, KangaMoon will develop a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game in which KANG will serve as the main in-game currency. With KANG, you can buy character upgrades or in-game items. Additionally, KANG holders gain exclusive access to challenges for extra tokens or in-game items.

Another impressive part of KangaMoon is its dedication to cultivating an active community. As an example, users can earn free KANG tokens by being engaged members before the official launch. This has caused a significant surge in social media interaction as traders eagerly like, share and retweet KangaMoon's content.

All these factors have helped KangaMoon obtain over 5,800 holders. Currently, one KANG token costs just $0.0196 - a 291% rise from its starting price of $0.005. Experts remain bullish as they forecast a rise to $0.5 once a Tier-1 CEX lists this altcoin in Q2 of 2024. This price prediction seems plausible with ties to the P2E gaming market, which will reach $885M by 2028.

Will KangaMoon Rise Faster than Ethereum and Cardano?With its low $14M market cap, KangaMoon could outshine Ethereum and Cardano. This means it needs fewer new funds so the price can skyrocket faster. If you want to buy one of the top altcoins, sign up for its presale using the links below and get a 10% bonus.
