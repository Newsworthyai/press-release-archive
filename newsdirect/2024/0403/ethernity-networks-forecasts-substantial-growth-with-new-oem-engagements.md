--News Direct--

Ethernity Networks Ltd (AIM:ENET, OTCQB:ENETF) vice president of marketing and business development Ilan Tevet shares the company's promising business outlook for 2024 and beyond based on current customer engagements.

Tevet told Proactive's Stephen Gunnion Ethernity is in advanced discussions with two Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) customers, testing the Universal Edge Platform 2025 (UEP2025) platform for launching solutions targeting distinct markets: a 25 Gigabit Ethernet Carrier Ethernet switch for business services and a similar switch with bonding capability for the wireless backhaul market. These engagements are anticipated to significantly enhance Ethernity's revenue in 2024, showcasing a remarkable growth trajectory.

Tevet said the increasing demand for high-capacity Carrier Ethernet Access switches is driven by the widespread adoption of cloud services and the surge in video conferencing and AI applications, which intensify bandwidth usage. Furthermore, the wireless backhaul market is expanding to accommodate the escalating data consumption by smartphones, with a forecasted CAGR of 37% through 2027. Ethernity addresses the challenges of environmental sensitivity in wireless link capacity through its patented bonding technology, enabling optimal service delivery by aggregating multiple wireless links.

He said Ethernity also offers versatile business models to meet OEM customer needs, including system sales for rapid revenue generation, a licensing model for custom integration, and the development of an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) for cost reduction and performance enhancement.
