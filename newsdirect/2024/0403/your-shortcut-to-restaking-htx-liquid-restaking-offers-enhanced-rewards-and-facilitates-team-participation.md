# Your Shortcut to Restaking: HTX Liquid Restaking Offers Enhanced Rewards and Facilitates Team Participation

--News Direct--

2024 could be labeled the "Year of Staking". Staking cryptos has become widely acknowledged as a means to accumulate wealth, which is evident across various blockchain ecosystems including Cosmos, Solana, Bitcoin, and Ethereum.

Currently, potential token airdrops from popular projects like EigenLayer, Puffer Finance, Merlin Chain, and BounceBit are directly igniting the "Restaking" sector, fueling FOMO sentiment in the market. What are simpler ways to engage in sharing the on-chain rewards from the Restaking sector within the blockchain ecosystem?

HTX Liquid Restaking emerges as the easiest method to get access to the Restaking sector.

HTX Liquid Restaking Boasts High Value, Free Claims, Greater Flexibility, and Over $100M Staking Quota

Since the launch of the HTX Liquid Staking event on February 29, HTX has pioneered as the first crypto exchange to enable users to participate in Restaking without any entry requirements.

Highlighted by features like high value, free claims, and greater flexibility, the HTX Liquid Restaking event recently saw its reward pool double on March 25 with the addition of another $500 million staking quota. This enhancement means that participants can share rewards generated by $100 million staking quota.

Users can register for HTX Liquid Restaking with their Spot and Futures account balances snapshotted to earn rewards, including:

● EigenLayer's initial airdrop (A trending Ethereum restaking project with TVL of over $7 billion)

● Puffer's initial airdrop (A trending Ethereum restaking project with TVL of over $1 billion)

● Merlin Chain's initial airdrop (A Bitcoin Layer 2 solution with TVL of over $1.5 billion)

● BounceBit's initial airdrop (A Bitcoin staking chain with TVL of over $0.45 billion)

● Crypto rewards, such as ETH, USDT, HTX, and TRX

HTX provides easy access to the Liquidity Restaking event. Visit the Liquid Restaking event page on the platform, and users can easily enroll in the event with just one click. Remember to fund your HTX account by making deposits, trades, etc., to hold at least $1 worth of BTC, ETH, USDT, HTX, TRX, or other designated assets.

HTX Liquid Restaking Enables Team Participation for Enhanced Rewards

As the event continues to evolve, HTX Liquid Staking has introduced a new feature: team participation. Joining teams encourages teamwork and competition, empowering participants to leverage their influence, and offering an opportunity to claim greater rewards. Participation is as simple as creating your own team or joining an existing one.

According to HTX's official announcement, the exchange has decided to further boost the event's reward pool by adding $20,000 worth of $HTX specifically for team leaders. (Stay tuned for more incentives for teams and team leaders.)

As for the event details, it is reported that snapshots of the event leaderboard will be taken from March 25, 2024, at 09:00 (UTC) to April 24, 2024, at 16:00 (UTC). Rewards worth $20,000 in $HTX will be distributed within 7 working days after April 24, 2024, at 16:00 (UTC). Moreover, the rewards will be given to the leaders of top-ranked teams that hold the top 3 positions for the most days within 30 days by April 24, 2024. The rankings are based on the leaderboard's snapshots taken daily at random time during the event period. Specifically, teams will be ranked based on the team participating amount (the total assets of all members enabled for Liquid Restaking for the designated cryptocurrencies). The leaderboard can be viewed on the event page.

Here's how you can create/join a team:
