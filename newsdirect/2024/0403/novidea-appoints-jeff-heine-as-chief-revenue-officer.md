# Novidea Appoints Jeff Heine as Chief Revenue Officer

--News Direct--

Novidea, creator of the cloud-based, data-driven enterprise insurance management platform for brokers, agents, MGAs/MGUs, carriers, and wholesalers, has added Jeff Heine as chief revenue officer (CRO). Heine will be instrumental in driving global revenue and further aligning Novidea’s sales, marketing, and other revenue-focused functions to achieve the company’s business and growth objectives.

Heine brings 20 years of Property and Casualty (P&C) insurance industry expertise to the role. Most recently, he served as CRO at Betterview, a remote property intelligence platform that turns data into actionable insights for P&C insurance carriers (acquired by Nearmap). Before that, Heine was CRO at Groundspeed Analytics, an AI-powered ingestion and data solution for the commercial P&C industry (acquired by Insurance Quantified). Heine has other related experience including Guidewire Software and Adsensa (now Coupa Software).

"Jeff is an accomplished CRO in the Insurtech market with proven experience building high-performing global teams, establishing scalable processes, and leading growth initiatives. His talents will be invaluable as Novidea continues to scale up its global operations,” said Roi Agababa, CEO of Novidea. “Jeff joins our strong leadership team to help guide the company's journey and to continue to deliver industry-leading innovation, quality, and value to our customers worldwide.”

With the addition of Heine, Novidea further strengthens its global leadership team, adding to the recent strategic hires of Erez Nissim as chief technology officer (CTO), Eran Ben Ezer as chief financial officer (CFO), and Yaniv Cohen as chief customer officer (CCO). By assembling a team of exceptional talent, Novidea reinforces its position as a top innovator in the global insurance technology landscape.

“I’ve spent the last two decades helping insurance brokers and carriers better assess and price risk, manage core processes and systems, and create efficiencies. I came to Novidea because I wanted to help reduce the friction brokers and carriers still experience in the insurance placement process and contribute to an innovative fast-growing company,” Heine said. “I look forward to helping our customers grow their businesses and create a better insurance experience for policyholders. I am excited to join a company that has the right team and technology to make insurance more accessible to businesses and consumers through better use of data and insights."
