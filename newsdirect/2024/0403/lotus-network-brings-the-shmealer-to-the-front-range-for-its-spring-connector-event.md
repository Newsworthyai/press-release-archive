# LOTUS NETWORK BRINGS THE “SHMEALER” TO THE FRONT RANGE FOR ITS SPRING CONNECTOR EVENT

--News Direct--

Lotus Network, a Denver-based non-profit organization providing opportunities for all women to create meaningful connections, announced today its 2024 Spring Connector event, Reigniting the Women’s Spirit, featuring the “Shmealer” (shame healer) Sarah Lajeunesse. An award-winning coach, writer and speaker, Lajeunesse brings Reigniting the Women’s Spirit to the U.S. for the first time at this Lotus Network event.

The discussion will explore how the weight of perfectionism, people-pleasing, societal, cultural and gender expectations and pressures, are deeply rooted in guilt and shame. Touching upon the ways these self-conscious emotions can prevent a woman from experiencing a greater, richer quality of life, this timely talk will explore the yearning so many women experience in wanting to feel whole and empowered.

Through a hilariously liberating and thought-provoking discussion about uncomfortable emotions, “ Reigniting the Women’s Spirit” is aimed at helping women:

* Identify and challenge their own personal limiting beliefs and unrelenting patterns that keep them stuck
* Set healthy boundaries and communicate them effectively with others
* Cultivate self-compassion and self-care practices that nurture well-being and happiness
* Uncover individual strengths for achieving self-confidence

Lajeunesse will provide tips on how to release the heavy, unnecessary burden of shame that has continued to plague many women for years, decades and even generations. She will also address ways to stop the unconscious passing down of guilt and shame repercussions throughout life.

The Spring Connector event will be held on Tuesday, May 7, 2024 from 7:00–9:00 P.M. at the Leach Center for the Performing Arts on the Colorado Academy campus, 3800 South Pierce Street, Denver, CO, 80235.

Lotus Network’s hope for the event is that all women – mothers, daughters, sisters and friends – become more empowered to make important and necessary journeys to reclaim their voices, choices and lives by releasing guilt and shame to better trust themselves.

“Reflecting Lotus Network’s founding mantra of ‘It’s Never Too Late...,’ we bring the Front Range a premier event to which we believe so many women can relate. Empowering women through connection is a global, topical conversation that we are bringing to the forefront through Sarah’s first U.S. discussion. Our goal for this event – and all our programming – is to truly connect women and provide them platforms and tools for learning, growth and self-discovery,” Lotus Network Co-founders Lisa Cook and Leslie Heins explained.
