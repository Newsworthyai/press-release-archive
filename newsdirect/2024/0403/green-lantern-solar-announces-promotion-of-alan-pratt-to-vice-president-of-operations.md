# Green Lantern Solar Announces Promotion of Alan Pratt to Vice President of Operations

--News Direct--

Green Lantern Solar, an innovative and trusted renewable energy developer, today announced the promotion of Alan Pratt to the position of Vice President of Operations.

With a proven track record as Green Lantern Solar’s Director of Operations for 10 years and deep experience in EPC roles before then, Alan brings exceptional leadership qualities and a steadfast commitment to the company’s mission.

In his new capacity, Alan will take charge of Green Lantern Solar’s Engineering Team and other critical areas such as the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) division.

“Alan’s exemplary leadership and deep-rooted dedication to Green Lantern Solar have consistently propelled our organization forward,” said Scott Buckley, President of Green Lantern Solar. “We are confident that under his guidance, our Engineering and O&M departments will continue to excel and contribute significantly to our strategic objectives.”

Alan’s promotion coincides with the retirement of Peter Edlund, who has been an integral part of Green Lantern Solar’s success for nearly a decade. Peter’s contributions have been instrumental in building a strong company and shaping the company’s growth.

“Peter’s retirement marks a significant milestone for Green Lantern Solar,” Buckley continued. “His expertise, dedication and leadership have made a lasting impact on our company and its trajectory. We extend our heartfelt appreciation to Peter for his years of dedicated service.”

During his tenure, Peter led Green Lantern Solar’s Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) division and the O&M division. He oversaw the successful completion of more than 125 community-scale solar projects and earned industry recognition, including the 2023 Solar Builder Community Solar Project of the Year.

“We express our deepest gratitude to Peter for his invaluable contributions,” Buckley added. “We wish him every success and fulfillment in his well-deserved retirement — or, as he likes to call it, ‘graduation.’ His hard work and good humor will be missed.”
