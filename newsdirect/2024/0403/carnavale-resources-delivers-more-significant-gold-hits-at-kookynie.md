# Carnavale Resources delivers more significant gold hits at Kookynie

--News Direct--

Carnavale Resources Ltd (ASX:CAV) CEO Humphrey Hale sits down with Jonarthan Jackson in the Proactive studio to discuss the significant strides being made at its Kookynie Gold Project, particularly at the Tiptoe and Champion South prospects. The company has reported new high-grade gold findings at Tiptoe that align with the bonanza-style mineralisation at McTavish East. Hale emphasises the potential of these results and those at Champion, which provide upside ahead of the companyâ€™s maiden resource estimate. With a strategy that includes open cut and underground mining, leveraging an existing third-party processing facility, Carnavale is well-positioned for future development. Exploration at Kookynie continues, targeting high-grade structural gold prospects, with anticipation building around the mineral resource estimate and mining study evaluation, which is expected to reveal further insights into the project's viability and potential.
