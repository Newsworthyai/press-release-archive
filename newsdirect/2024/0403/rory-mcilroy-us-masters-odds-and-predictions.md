Rory Mcilroy’s US Masters Odds and PredictionsRory Mcilroy, Northern Ireland’s superstar, will be one of the favorites going into the Masters on April 12th; currently standing at 9/1 to win the tournament, he will no doubt be eyeing this tournament to add to his tally of four majors. This tournament has eluded him many times over the years, and during that time, he has rarely been at the top of the leaderboard by Sunday, especially when you think Rory Mcilroy made his debut in 2010.

The 2024 Genesis Invitational golf tournament was played recently; the eventual winner was Hideki Matsuyama, who won with an incredible round of 9- 62 for the round. Other notables was Will Zalatoris, with a total score of 14- considering he has been out of the game for nearly eighteen months due to a back injury and rehabilitation, enduring some family bereavement made it a very emotional day for Will. Mcilroy, on the other hand, failed to shine throughout the tournament came a commendable tie for twenty-fourth

With the Masters just around the corner (April 12th), the selection process for the tournament has been finalized, and players from all over the globe will be vying for that green jacket in the most intense cauldrons in the world. Augusta, to many people, is the home of golf and is the epitome of pure greens, savage roughs and, in some cases, ten-twelve foot bunkers; once you get through that, you have some iconic holes to contend with, like the 11,12 and 13 collectively known as Amen Corner, all three holes can ruin a players chance at a Green Jacket. Still, players can catapult themselves into a glorious position if played well.

Players must have the most outlandish talent and skill to play Augusta, and it takes a special kind of player to tame it and win it. The golfing world of sport is awash with many highly skilled players who possess such skills; players like Rory Mcilroy, who is now the world's number one player by his standards, have had a quiet season up to now. Patrick Cantly and Will Zalatoris possess the game to conquer the likes of Augusta. Though Zarlartoris came runner-up to Justin Thompson in the Wanamaker Trophy in 2022, he unfortunately was injured for the best part of 2023 and suffered a family loss recently.

Patrick Cantly is another player you can't ignore, another fledgling with all the skills required to conquer Augusta, especially his short game. Though at times he can be slow and can meander during his play, he sometimes attracts the wrong attention due to that trait. His last PGA win was back in 2022, when he was victorious at the BMW championship. To date, Patrick Cantly is the winner of eight PGA tour events.

Other players who could be in contention for that illustrious Green Jacket are Brooks Koepka, Jordan Spieth, Jon Rahm, Cameron Smith, and Ludvig Aberg, to name but a few. Brooks Koepka is another player with the utmost talent and holds five majors, four of which were won in an astonishing three-year period in which he established himself as the best player in the world.

Ludvig Alberg, another young rising talent, came to prominence in 2023; just seventy-five days after turning professional, Aberg lifted his first professional silverware in his sixth DP World Tour at the Omega European Masters. The win catapulted the young Swede into Ryder Cup contention; since then, he has become one of the sensations in golf.
