# First Phosphate 2nd set of assays at Begin-Lamarche shows 2 metre vein of massive Apatite

--News Direct--

First Phosphate Corp CEO John Passalacqua and Chief Geologist Gilles Laverdiere joined Steve Darling from Proactive to provide an update on the company's 25,000-meter drill program at the Bégin-Lamarche project in Quebec. So far, the company has drilled 16,435 meters, with assays back from 5,642 meters.

Passalacqua explained to Proactive that drilling at the Phosphate Mountain Zone continues to deliver strong phosphate mineralization. Both the Mountain and Northern Zones exhibit high-grade phosphate on the surface, while the Southern Zone shows large tonnage potential over a strike length of 1.5 kilometers.

At the Phosphate Mountain Zone: Drill hole BL-24-48 intersected 15.01% P2O5 (phosphate) over 7.65 meters from a depth of 36.9 meters, including one assay of 31.24% P2O5 over 1.1 meters. Other drill holes in this zone also yielded core results of 30%+ apatite.

The Northern Zone included drill hole BL-24-36 intersected 6.83% P2O5 over 108.0 meters starting at a depth of 234.0 meters. Drill hole BL-24-44 intersected 7.48% P2O5 over 90.6 meters starting at a depth of 192.4 meters.

At the Northwestern Zone drill hole BL-24-49 intersected 8.65% P2O5 over 33.0 meters from a depth of 72.5 meters while the Southern Zone showed drill hole BL-24-43 intersected 5.41% P2O5 over 258.0 meters from a depth of 111.0 meters.

These results demonstrate the significant phosphate potential of the Bégin-Lamarche project, reaffirming the company's commitment to advancing its exploration efforts in the region.
