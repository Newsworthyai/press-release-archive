# UNO Pizzeria & Grill Celebrates National Deep Dish Pizza Day with BOGO Pizza Offer

--News Direct--

National Deep Dish Pizza Day is Friday, April 5th and UNO Pizzeria & Grill has an incredible offer planned to celebrate the day. To honor the day that celebrates the deep flaky crust, chunky tomato sauce and bountiful cheese, UNO is offering a Buy One, Get One Free* deal on any deep dish pizza at participating restaurants.

UNO Pizzeria & Grill is the creator of deep dish pizza, so the entire day of recognition traces back to the original Pizzeria UNO located in downtown Chicago. The pizza baked in a deep dish pan was dreamed up in 1943 in the Pizzeria UNO kitchen located at the corner of Wabash and Ohio Street in Chicago. The brand has expanded over the years and includes over 70 locations that offer this iconic deep dish pizza, along with a varied menu that includes appetizers, sandwiches, pasta & entrées. Pizzeria UNO celebrated its 80th anniversary this year, so the deep dish pizza is also 80 years old. Deep dish pizza has become a staple food item in Chicago and numerous pizza brands now offer the legacy pies in Chicago & beyond.

Uno Pizzeria & Grill wants guests to join in on the celebration. The National Deep Dish Day offer is quite simple – Buy one deep dish pizza and you get a second deep dish pizza for FREE! The offer will be valid all day and available for dine-in or takeout. (The lower priced pizza is the free pizza and participation will vary across the country. Check with your local UNO. Offer is not valid at the original Chicago Pizzeria UNO or Pizzeria DUE locations. If ordering online, the coupon code BOGODEEP should be used).
