# AI platform SiftHub raises $5.5m as it rescues sales & presales teams from repetitive tasks

--News Direct--

Information overload from ad campaigns, email marketing, and a company’s website means that buyers are equipped with more than a basic understanding of a product or service well before a sales meeting. This means sellers need deeper product knowledge and easy access to proprietary company information to win new customers. However, the current sales tech stack does not support this foundational shift in the role of sales and presales teams.

AI platform for sales SiftHub has today raised $5.5 million in seed funding to help sales and presales teams discover knowledge and generate responses to customer needs immediately. The funding round was led by Matrix Partners India and Blume Ventures with participation from Neon Fund and executive operators and founders from Superhuman, Cloudflare, DevRev, RazorPay, and SuperOps.

SiftHub’s AI platform is changing how sales and presales teams discover up-to-date information and generate accurate responses grounded in company knowledge. No more “I’ll get back to you”s that could lead to a lost opportunity. One-click integrations with workplace apps such as CRM, content repository, knowledgebase, and more allow SiftHub to bring all enterprise knowledge into a single, accessible hub. Its unified semantic search capabilities make it easy to find the right information at the right time without toggling between screens.

“After speaking to 200+ leaders, it dawned on me that it’s completely unreasonable to expect sales and presales professionals to memorize all the ins and outs of the product in order to be able to respond to clients with complex technical details. Trying to find up-to-date accurate information when it is scattered across Slack, Gmail, Drive, HubSpot, Confluence, and more is incredibly difficult. The fact that sales spends only 30% of their time selling cries for a change - and that’s where our platform comes in.” said Manisha Raisinghani, Founder of SiftHub.

SiftHub is uniquely positioned to deliver secure, private, access-controlled answers that trace back to the source. Using RAG technology and fine-tuned LLMs with industry-specific knowledge training, SiftHub allows companies to generate personalized responses with zero hallucinations. This guarantees increased transparency and reduced risk and inspires absolute trust to use AI for all their needs.

Now, sales teams can finally focus on what they do best - selling! SiftHub simplifies the usually time-consuming back-and-forth between sales and various other teams as a deal progresses. With its easy-to-use project management and seamless workflow automation capabilities, the platform helps streamline collaboration between teams as they complete infosec questionnaires, vendor assessment forms, RFPs, and RFIs.

SiftHub was founded in July 2023 by Manisha Rasinghani, a second-time founder. Before SiftHub, she co-founded LogiNext as CTO and raised over $50m from Tiger Global and others.

“GenAI is not just a technology, it’s a revolution in productivity. It unlocks the ability to solve a legacy problem in a modern way improving efficiency by 80%,” said Manisha Raisinghani, “By integrating GenAI with advanced workflow automation and collaborative capabilities, we’re providing an end-to-end solution for our users. From the moment the first information request is received to the closure of each sale with satisfactory responses, SiftHub will remain a trusted partner for sales organizations.”

Pranay Desai, Managing Director at Matrix Partners India commented: "Buyers have become smarter and engage sales later in the buying journey, with more advanced questions. As a result, the expectation from sales teams has changed - they need to know advanced product, technical, and legal information to get the win. Sales and presales teams lack the necessary tooling to handle this new selling environment. We are excited by SiftHub's vision to use AI to manage product knowledge so that sales can focus on relationships."

Sanjay Nath, Partner at Blume Ventures, said, “SiftHub is Manisha’s second venture in the SaaS space. Armed with over a decade of entrepreneurial experience and an impressive track record, Manisha and her team are building a game-changing AI platform to transform the entire sales and presales process. We are excited to back the SiftHub team and be a part of their ambitious journey.”
