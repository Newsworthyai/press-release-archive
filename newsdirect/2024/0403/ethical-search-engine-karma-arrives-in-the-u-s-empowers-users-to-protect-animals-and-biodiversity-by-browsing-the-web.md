# ETHICAL SEARCH ENGINE KARMA ARRIVES IN THE U.S.; EMPOWERS USERS TO PROTECT ANIMALS AND BIODIVERSITY BY BROWSING THE WEB

--News Direct--

KARMA, the world’s first search engine dedicated to protecting animals and biodiversity, is now available in the United States. KARMA utilizes the revenue generated by users’ Internet searches to fund its first non-profit partners, Re:wild and Humane Society International, expected to surpass $100M in [the United States/North America] over the next three years.

KARMA taps into the sponsored links market – worth a whopping $300+ billion per year – to help fund rigorously selected non-profit partners recognized for their actions in animal protection and biodiversity conservation. Similar to traditional search engines, KARMA displays sponsored links when users make an online search. However, unlike traditional search engines, KARMA donates 100% of its proceeds to its non-profit partners.

Launched in France in 2022, KARMA has received enthusiastic feedback, with more than 150,000 downloads and rave user reviews, averaging a rating of 4.7 stars across the leading app stores.

KARMA was also recently selected by Google to be displayed in the Google Choice Screen menu in European markets. As a result, Android users are prompted during setup to choose their default search engine among a list of 12 options that now includes KARMA. The ongoing antitrust case from the U.S. government against Google may also lead to a similar development coming to U.S. markets in the future.

With an estimated market size of $132B, the U.S. sponsored links market segment is highly lucrative and a tremendous opportunity for KARMA and its cause.

“Search engines are used daily by all Internet users, making them the most scalable of tools capable of having a material impact in supporting financially the urgent needs of animal protection and biodiversity conservation, said Yann Kandelman, Co-Founder and CEO of KARMA. “KARMA is providing Internet users with the opportunity to be part of the solution in just a few clicks. For example, if just 1% of Google users were to use KARMA as their default search engine, we would be able to donate more than $1 billion per year to our non-profit beneficiaries, including our first selected partners, Re:wild and Humane Society International.”

Learn & Act with KARMA

In a world where a species becomes extinct every 20 minutes and animal suffering is at an all-time high thanks, in part, to 99% of U.S. meat coming from factory farms, KARMA also pledges to empower its users to “Learn & Act.”

"Thanks to its "Learn & Act" feature, KARMA provides a news feed of useful information and highlights concrete and easy ways to make a difference on a daily basis. In just a few clicks, users can maximize their impact by signing a petition, registering to try a vegan diet for a week, participating in a citizen science project to identify bird species in their area, and more.

More on KARMA’s Partnership with Re:Wild and Humane Society International

KARMA has selected Re:wild and Humane Society International-two key players in the biodiversity conservation and animal protection movements- as its first two non-profit partners. The organizations have joined forces with KARMA and will benefit from the $100M KARMA expects to raise in the North America over the next 3 years.

“Conserving biodiversity is not just about saving individual species,” said Carrie Hutchison, director of marketing and brand for Re:wild. “It’s about maintaining the complex ecosystems that sustain life on Earth. By working with companies like KARMA, which are supporting our conservation work and expanding our reach, we can protect more of the world’s irreplaceable places for biodiversity, and inspire a global community to act for the wild.”

“At Humane Society International, we believe in creating a world where animals are treated with respect and protected from cruelty. Switching your default search engine to KARMA is an easy and free way to support our work. Your internet searches with KARMA can help fund our vital initiatives such as banning the sale of real fur, ending some of the most inhumane factory farming practices, and creating a more compassionate world for all animals,” said Nick Jones, executive director at Humane Society International/UK.

KARMA is exploring future partnerships with several other American nonprofits using complementary levers to protect animals and biodiversity.

Robust, Versatile and Privacy-Friendly: The Technology Behind Karma

KARMA is available on all platforms: through a mobile browser app on iOS and Android, and through an extension for Chrome, Safari, Brave, Firefox and Edge on both PC and Mac.

KARMA technology makes it a robust, transparent, and secure search engine:

* Based on privacy-oriented search engine Brave Search, KARMA’s web indexing is fully independent from internet giants Google and Bing, making it an ethical alternative, alongside other challengers launched in the recent years (Perplexity.ai, You.com, PreSearch, Yep, etc.), in a market traditionally dominated by large, listed companies.
* Developed based on Firefox’s open-source code, KARMA’s mobile application supports ad blockers and anti-tracking extensions.
* To ensure the best results to users, KARMA provides a one-click access to a wide range of vertical, independent search engines: unbiased customer reviews from Reddit, royalty-free images from Unsplash, GIFs from GIPHY, etc.
* Committed to protecting their users’ privacy, KARMA does not permanently store search histories nor resell personal data to third parties.
