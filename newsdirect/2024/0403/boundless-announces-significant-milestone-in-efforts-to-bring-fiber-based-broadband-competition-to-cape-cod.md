# Boundless Announces Significant Milestone in Efforts to Bring Fiber-based Broadband Competition to Cape Cod

--News Direct--

Boundless is excited to announce a significant milestone in its mission to provide lightning-fast, reliable, fiber-optic broadband at affordable pricing to the residents and businesses of Cape Cod, with a major boost from the Town of Falmouth.

On Monday, March 25, the Municipal Light Plant (MLP) recommended Boundless as the preferred provider to bring broadband competition to the Town of Falmouth. The Board of Selectman directed the MLP to continue its discussions with Boundless to help facilitate its entry into the Falmouth broadband market and determine what community benefits the town could also expect from Boundless.

The MLP’s recommendation of Boundless follows a comprehensive multi-year evaluation of its broadband landscape. Beginning with a thorough market feasibility study, Falmouth issued a Request for Information (RFI) that attracted responses from seven broadband applicants. After completing its evaluation process, Boundless emerged as the frontrunner for introducing fiber broadband competition in Falmouth.

"We are excited to partner with Boundless to enhance broadband competition and accessibility in Falmouth," stated Ed Swartz, Acting Chair of Falmouth Municipal Light Plant. "Our residents and businesses demand affordable, high-speed, fiber-based broadband, and we are eager to take this significant step toward meeting those needs."

Jeff Seidenfaden, CEO of Boundless, expressed enthusiasm about the town’s actions, stating, "Boundless is gratified by the MLP’s recommendation and is looking forward to bringing fiber competition to the second largest and one of the most influential communities on Cape Cod. We understand that other Cape Cod communities are looking to Falmouth as a model, and we are committed to expedited deployment and delivering super-fast “Boundless” broadband access."

Boundless’ partnership with Falmouth underscores its dedication to bridging the digital divide and empowering communities with cutting-edge broadband solutions.
