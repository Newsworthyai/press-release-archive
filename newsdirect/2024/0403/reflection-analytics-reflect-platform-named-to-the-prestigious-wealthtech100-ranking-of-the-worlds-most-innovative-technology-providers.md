# Reflection Analytics’ Reflect Platform Named to the Prestigious WealthTech100 Ranking of the World’s Most Innovative Technology Providers

--News Direct--

Reflection Analytics, a technology company delivering ESG investment evaluation, reporting and advisory services, announced today that its Reflect software platform has been named to the prestigious WealthTech100 list of the world’s most innovative technology providers that are transforming the operations of investment firms, private banks and financial advisors.

Reflect is the first and only platform for investor-focused ESG analysis, serving asset managers, financial advisors and investors/institutions across six key areas: advisory, due diligence, compliance, portfolio management, auditing and reporting. Reflect’s inclusion on the WealthTech 100 comes within Reflect’s first year as a compliance tool.

“This recognition by the WealthTech100 is validation for Reflect,” said Jason Britton, founder and chief executive officer of Reflection Analytics. “The Names Rule requires funds generally aligned with ESG terms to have a minimum of 80 percent of its holding invested in what the average investor would consider the plain English meaning of those terms. Reflect is basically a lie detector that investors and fund managers can use to determine whether funds comply with that common-sense, truth-in-advertising standard.”

Launched today by FinTech Global, a specialist research firm, The WealthTech100 shines a spotlight on the WealthTech companies that every stakeholder in the wealth management industry should know about. The finalists were picked by a panel of analysts and industry experts, and judges were tasked with reviewing a list of more than 1,300 companies, with FinTech Global providing detailed information on each company to aid the decision process.

To make the list, the panel looked for companies that are helping address some of the biggest challenges and opportunities within wealth management. The list highlights the leading companies in areas such as client acquisition, financial planning, portfolio management and digital brokerage.

"As the great wealth transfer takes place, wealth management firms are seeking ways to update their operations to meet the demands of future customers,” said FinTech Global director Richard Sachar. “While older generations preferred a human-touch, younger generations place quick, simple and digital processes at the top of their requirements. The WealthTech100 list provides senior decision-makers with a guide on the best vendors in the market and practical examples of how the latest AI advancements are transforming the investment industry.”

Launched just two months after the SEC expanded Rule 35d-1, the “Names Rule,” to include ESG terms, Reflect is the market’s only “Names Rule"-compliant software, providing an investor-focused rating that scores companies across 250 data points in 18 ESG sub-themes while also offering asset managers a portfolio management tool to ensure continuous compliance.

Under the SEC’s expanded rule, asset managers have 24 months from September 2023 to begin reporting on their alignment, demonstrating that 80% of their investments are in securities that reflect the terms in their name, or risk regulatory fines and fees. Unlike other ESG rating companies, which focus on only financial materiality and from the corporation’s management perspective, Reflect assesses companies from the perspective of an investor’s understanding and reasonable expectations.

Beyond its use as a compliance tool, Reflect is designed to support values-based investing. The Reflect platform allows advisors, investors and institutions to review portfolios based on ESG components that are most important to them while also identifying types of companies to avoid, such as those associated with weapons or alcohol.

After analyzing an investment portfolio, Reflect provides a real-time, percentage-match score, rating investments across 18 sub-themes ranging from “not aligned” to “strongly aligned.” Reflect can also weigh an existing portfolio against a curated list of investments, allowing individuals and institutions to compare assets via a side-by-side analysis.
