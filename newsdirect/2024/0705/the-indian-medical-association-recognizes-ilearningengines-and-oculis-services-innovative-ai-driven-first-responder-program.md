The Indian Medical Association (IMA), the largest represented organization of doctors of the modern system of medicine in India, recognized iLearningEngines (NASDAQ: AILE) and Oculis Services for their joint venture program focused on first responder training for teens. The objective of the program is to empower students aged 14-18 with the necessary skills to make a significant difference in emergencies. The hybrid model combines AI-supported online modules with personalized in-school training programs.

Instilling PreparednessLaunched in September 2023, the First Responder Program is a comprehensive initiative that not only equips students with the skills and confidence to act swiftly and effectively during emergency situations but also contributes to the creation of a safer and more prepared community. With over 30 schools already registered, the program is a key part of those schools’ extracurricular programs, preparing students to become competent and confident first responders.
