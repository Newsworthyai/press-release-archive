# Building Momentum: Zynex Inc.’s (NASDAQ: ZYXI) Steady Rise in the Pain Management Market

Demand for pain management devices is climbing worldwide, fueled by several major trends. As chronic disease rates soar, the need for effective, drug-free pain solutions has grown more pressing. At the same time, advancements in medical tech have opened doors to safer, non-invasive pain relief options, making them more widely adopted by healthcare providers. Rising numbers of surgeries have also created a strong demand for post-operative pain control, while the pain monitoring market continues to surge. With these combined factors, the global pain management device market is expected to reach $5.68 billion by 2032, expanding at a steady 9% CAGR.

In this dynamic and fast-evolving field, Zynex Inc. (NASDAQ: ZYXI) stands out as a key player, bringing new solutions to the growing pain management market.

A Closer Look at a Leading Innovator in Pain Management

Founded in 1996, Zynex Inc. has carved out a unique space in the medical technology industry, specializing in non-invasive medical devices designed for pain management and rehabilitation. With a mission to improve the lives of patients with chronic pain and other debilitating conditions, Zynex consistently develops innovative solutions that support pain management without relying on medications. The recent FDA approval of its latest device, the TensWave, and strong financial performance through Q3 2024 highlight Zynex’s upward trajectory in a growing market.

Expanding Product Line with FDA-Cleared TensWave DeviceZynex's newest offering, the TensWave device, received FDA clearance in September 2024. This device is a non-invasive pain relief option that uses TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) technology, a proven method to alleviate pain without medication. According to CEO Thomas Sandgaard, TensWave was developed to meet the demand for a high-quality TENS device that fits insurance reimbursement criteria. "We recognized a gap in the market," Sandgaard said, "and TensWave is our answer to that demand. It complements our flagship device, the NexWave, by giving patients a safe, effective, and drug-free alternative for pain relief."

The TensWave device is designed to work in tandem with Zynex’s other products, specifically the NexWave, which offers multiple electrotherapy modalities. While NexWave remains Zynex’s top-tier product, TensWave offers a more targeted solution for patients covered under insurance plans that only reimburse TENS-based treatments. By diversifying its product lineup, Zynex positions itself to cater to a broader range of insurance plans, potentially reaching more patients who need accessible and effective pain management tools.

Strong Financial Performance and Business Growth

Zynex’s Q3 2024 financial results showcase the company’s resilience and growth momentum. During the quarter, orders in the Pain Management division saw a 13% increase compared to the same period in 2023, while revenue per sales representative jumped by 25%, reaching approximately $530,000. Overall, Zynex reported net revenue of $50 million, a slight increase from the previous year, and net income of $2.4 million, equating to an EPS of $0.07. Cash flow from operations was robust at $7.1 million, and the company’s working capital stood at $58.5 million as of September 30, 2024.

In February 2022, an article from Seeking Alpha suggested that Zynex might face a 50% drop in EBITDA due to contract changes with UnitedHealthcare. However, rather than the anticipated loss, Zynex managed to maintain and even grow its partnership with UnitedHealthcare. Over the past three years, Zynex has consistently added new patients with UnitedHealthcare, backed by a renewed agreement with the insurer. Notably, Zynex has recorded steady revenue growth, with year-over-year increases of 21%, 17%, and 9% since 2022, effectively countering these earlier predictions and showcasing Zynex’s operational strength.

Looking ahead to Q4, Zynex has set a revenue target of $53.6 million with an estimated EPS of $0.09. For the full year of 2024, the company expects to achieve net revenue of at least $200 million, representing a 9% growth from the prior year and an EPS of $0.20. These projections suggest that Zynex is on track to sustain its current pace of expansion.

Strategic Focus on Innovation and Market AdaptabilityOne of Zynex’s core strengths lies in its ongoing commitment to research and development, aiming to diversify its product portfolio to address unmet needs in pain management. Sandgaard has emphasized that Zynex’s long-term goals include not just incremental growth in its pain management division but also the expansion of its orthopedic products, ensuring that the company has a well-rounded suite of medical devices. In the words of Sandgaard, “We are working to expedite the onboarding of new sales reps while maintaining a high standard for productivity. Our focus on FDA approvals of next-generation devices and new therapy products delivered FDA clearance of our new TensWave device during the quarter.”

Alongside pain management, Zynex is making strides in non-invasive monitoring systems for hospital use, indicating that the company is serious about diversifying beyond its core offerings. This multi-pronged approach gives Zynex the flexibility to adjust to changing market demands while further establishing its reputation as a provider of comprehensive, non-invasive healthcare solutions.

Future Growth PotentialWith the FDA approval of the TensWave device, Zynex has reinforced its presence in the pain management market, where demand for non-opioid treatment options is on the rise. The device could become a significant revenue driver, particularly as the opioid crisis has heightened interest in alternative pain management therapies. TENS therapy, a proven method for reducing both chronic and acute pain, positions Zynex favorably among patients and healthcare providers looking for safe, effective treatments.

Zynex’s current product line also includes devices for cold and hot therapy, cervical traction, braces, and compression solutions, allowing it to cater to a broad array of patient needs. As the company anticipates a return to its typical growth rate of approximately 20% in the pain management division in 2025, the new products and strong sales infrastructure could enable it to scale more effectively.

ConclusionIn 2024, Zynex Inc. (NASDAQ: ZYXI) has shown resilience by expanding its product portfolio and maintaining steady growth. The FDA clearance of the TensWave device further strengthens its position in the non-invasive pain management field, supporting its mission to deliver effective, drug-free pain solutions. With solid revenue growth and strong partnerships, ZYXI is set to build on its progress, providing lasting value for patients and shareholders alike.
