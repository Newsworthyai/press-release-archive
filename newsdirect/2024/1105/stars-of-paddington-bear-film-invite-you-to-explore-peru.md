# Stars of Paddington Bear film invite you to explore Peru

Actors of the successful Paddington movie series gathered in London on Sunday for the world premiere of its latest installment. Directed by Dougal Wilson, the 2024 film “Paddington in Peru” will spark the interest and tourism in Peru across the world, featuring internationally renowned bucket-list attractions.

World-famous Hugh Bonneville, who plays Henry Brown in the series of beloved family films, addressed the Peruvian audience: “Thank you for loaning us your spectacled bear who has brought such joy to our nation and hopefully you are now getting an influx of tourists coming to visit you”.

Hollywood A-list star Antonio Banderas plays riverboat captain Hunter Cabot, who assists the Brown family on their adventure. The actor spoke of his memories in Paddington’s homeland and noted, “I visited Peru with my daughter Stella six years ago, we did the Inka Trail, walking from Cusco to Machupicchu. We did it in four days. It wasn’t easy but it was one of the most beautiful and spiritual experiences that I had in my life”.

The ursine hero from "deepest, darkest Peru" first appeared in UK author Michael Bond's 1958 book "A Bear Called Paddington". "Paddington in Peru" opens in the UK and Ireland on November 8, and in the US early in 2025.
