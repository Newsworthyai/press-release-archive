DECOYS Seafood Restaurant and Bennetts Creek Marina

Waterfront Restaurant, Blind Duck Tiki Bar, Bennetts Creek Marina, and Cottages on the Point

Escape the hustle and head to Decoys, with its stunning views of Bennetts Creek. This restaurant specializes in an innovative menu that features a range of gourmet comfort foods, from artisanal burgers and hand-cut fries to creative seafood dishes and farm-fresh salads. With its on-site seafood restaurant, 60-slip marina, The Blind Duck Tiki Bar featuring live entertainment on the weekends on its deck, and four luxurious cottages for your overnight stay, Decoys has a warm, inviting ambiance and is set to become the go-to spot for both casual dining and special occasions.

VINTAGE TAVERN

Step into a restaurant with genuine character where great food is served without pretension. A place that welcomes guests with a relaxed atmosphere and surrounds them with rustic arts and crafts architecture such as exposed beams, Rumsford fireplaces in each dining room, and game trophies in the lounge. From the exhibition kitchen come signature dishes prepared by the culinary team, among them an appetizing Taste of Southern Goodness sampler of homemade biscuits, house-made sausages, shaved Virginia ham, deviled eggs, house-made spreads such as strawberry jam, and seasonal entrees like oven-baked flounder with herb-onion spoon bread and lemon brown butter sauce. Vintage Tavern just received its two-stem award from Wine Spectator, showcasing its deep commitment to wine. The menu is truly Seasonally Southern.

RIVER STONE CHOPHOUSE

The River Stone Chophouse is Coastal Virginia’s premier Chophouse featuring Steaks, Seafood, and Raw Bar. The only restaurant locally aging Hereford Beef and custom cutting our own steaks to delight every carnivore. Signature dishes include a 22 oz. Dry Aged Ribeye, aged in-house for 28 days, Deviled Crab Dip, and Live Maine Lobsters. A rotating selection of oysters, plus seasonal salads and sides, complete the dining experience. Exceptional service combined with a carefully selected Two Stem award-winning wine list makes dining at River Stone an unforgettable experience. The Arts and Crafts inspired space includes a stone fireplace, romantic booths, dramatic lighting, an oyster and raw bar, and a vibrant bar scene featuring Happy Hour every weekday. A separate bar menu offers more casual selections including a ½ lb burger, House Cut Fries, and a Philly Steak Spring Roll. Outside the bar, the stone patio with a fire pit offers a relaxing atmosphere for an after-dinner cocktail or to enjoy a fine cigar. The second floor offers four private rooms with exceptional audio-visual to accommodate all your meeting needs.

A New Chapter for Virginia’s Culinary Scene

The acquisition of these celebrated restaurants marks an exciting new chapter for Pack Brothers Hospitality. The Pack brothers' passion for creating outstanding dining experiences and their commitment to maintaining high standards of quality and service will ensure that Decoys Seafood and Bennetts Creek Marina, Vintage Tavern, and River Stone Chophouse continue to be beloved destinations for locals and visitors alike.

“We look forward to the dedicated teams at each restaurant and working together to uphold the high standards that these establishments are known for,” said Randy Pack, Co-Founder of Pack Brothers Hospitality. “Our goal is to honor the legacy of these iconic restaurants while introducing new elements that will delight our guests and keep these venues at the forefront of Virginia’s dining scene.”
