# Mothers' Milk Bank California Launches Cares Program and Marks 50 Years of Service

Mothers' Milk Bank California (MMB California), the oldest continuously operating independent nonprofit milk bank in the United States, celebrates a significant milestone of half a century dedicated to serving infants and families in need across the country.

MMB has updated the name of the organization to include 'California' to honor its roots in the state. Central to MMB California's legacy is a network of more than 30 nonprofit mothers’ milk banks across the United States and in Mexico that have followed the model MMB California established 50 years ago.

Since 1974, Mothers’ Milk Bank California has distributed 16 million ounces of human donor milk to some of the country’s most at-risk babies. That’s equivalent to filling 7 swimming pools with liquid gold. Our community of milk donors at MMB California is nearly 25,000 strong, supporting thousands of families in their times of need. The organization collaborates with a growing number of hospitals nationwide to provide safe, lifesaving nourishment to their tiniest patients. MMB California advances the milk banking industry through partnerships, research support, and advocacy for stringent health and safety guidelines.

“As we celebrate our 50th anniversary, we reflect on the incredible journey of saving lives and supporting families. Our new MMB California Cares Program is a testament to our commitment to quality, efficiency, equity, and education. We are excited to continue our mission and expand our reach to ensure that every baby in need has access to safe donor milk,” said Jennifer Benito-Kowalski, Chief Executive Officer of Mothers' Milk Bank California.

Today, MMB California announced the launch of their 50th anniversary, MMB California Cares Program, along with their vision for the next 50 years. This initiative aims to build and strengthen the Milk Donor Community, highlighting the ongoing dedication to:

* Quality Assurance and Compliance: Upholding rigorous standards for processing and distributing donor human milk to ensure safety and efficacy.
* Efficiency and Excellence: Streamlining operations to maximize the impact of milk donations across our expanding network.
* Equity and Access Initiatives: Increasing access to donor human milk for all families in California and beyond.
* Education and Outreach Campaigns: Launching comprehensive programs to raise awareness about the life-saving benefits of donor human milk and foster community among donors and recipients.

Alongside these initiatives, Mothers' Milk Bank California has unveiled a newly redesigned website. Featuring enhanced navigation and user-friendly interfaces, the site provides resources for donors, healthcare providers, and families seeking support.
