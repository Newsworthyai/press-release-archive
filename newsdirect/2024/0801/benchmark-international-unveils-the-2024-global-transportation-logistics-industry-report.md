Benchmark International is excited to announce the release of its latest industry analysis, the 2024 Global Transportation & Logistics Industry Report. This detailed report provides vital insights into the growth, trends, and dynamics shaping the global transportation and logistics sector.

The global freight and logistics market is projected to grow to $18.69 billion by 2026, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.4%. The logistics segment alone is expected to reach $6.55 trillion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 4.7% from 2022 to 2027. This growth is driven by the increasing need for efficient and cost-effective transportation and storage solutions across various industries.

The report highlights key drivers of market growth, including the rapid proliferation of trade agreements, technological advancements, and the surge in e-commerce. Technological innovations such as automated material handling equipment, robotics, GPS, and blockchain integration are transforming logistics operations, enabling real-time tracking and predictive management. The rise of e-commerce has significantly increased the volume of shipments, creating both opportunities and challenges for logistics companies.

Key trends identified in the report include the adoption of green logistics solutions, the integration of advanced technologies, and the growth of the "last mile" gig economy delivery. These trends are shaping the future of logistics, with an emphasis on sustainability, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.

The report also explores the anticipated activity in the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) landscape within the transportation and logistics sector. Lower interest rates and improved market conditions are expected to drive consolidation and expansion efforts, particularly in the U.S. and Canada.
