"Our expansion into the Flatiron community represents a milestone for Chelsea Piers Fitness, pairing our unmatched fitness experience with one of Manhattan’s most active neighborhoods," said David Tewksbury, CEO and Co-Founder of Chelsea Piers Fitness. "We designed our Flatiron club to be a destination where the community can come together to prioritize health and wellness. With extensive amenities and a strong focus on community and wellbeing, this new location embodies our dedication to making a positive impact on New Yorkers’ lives."

To design a space that honors the brand’s deep roots in New York City and the essence of its new locale Chelsea Piers Fitness joined forces with Dan Fink Studio, a distinguished interior design and architecture firm. The club embodies a blend of modernity and heritage, combining cutting-edge wellness technology with timeless architectural motifs reminiscent of New York's iconic public buildings. Paying homage to Chelsea Piers Fitness' legacy, the design artfully integrates elements from its original location — including industrial red trusses and a grand staircase constructed with materials inspired by the flagship Pier 60, and custom leaded stained glass windows to represent the hues of the Hudson River. Furthermore, the club features a curated collection of commissioned artwork from local New York artists that celebrates the Flatiron neighborhood's spirit, adding a distinctive cultural layer to the member experience.

“Designing this club was an unbelievable journey, weaving the rich history of both Chelsea Piers Fitness and New York City into an architectural narrative,” said Ariel Calderón, Vice President Architecture and Design at Chelsea Piers Fitness. “Our goal was to create a welcoming and inclusive space that embodies community and New York City’s dynamic spirit – a place where people can gather, exercise, work, and connect, capturing the essence of Chelsea Piers."
