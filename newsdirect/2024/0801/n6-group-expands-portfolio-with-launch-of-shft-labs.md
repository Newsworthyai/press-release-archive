# N6 Group Expands Portfolio with Launch of SHFT Labs

N6 Group (N6G), a family office operating company with interests in digital media and marketing, sports and entertainment, and technology, today announced the launch of its latest venture, SHFT Labs, a strategic think tank designed to tackle marketing challenges for today’s brands.

SHFT was created to solve problems. Run by experts in creative, media, and technology, SHFT leverages its extensive understanding of marketing factors combined with AI technology to address the challenges faced by modern brands. With a unique think tank-style business model, SHFT complements existing teams and agency partners and works to solve specific problems that brands face in the areas of creative, media, social and tech.

Once a solution has been determined, SHFT can execute across multiple touch points, from full-funnel cross-platform advertising campaigns and content creation to eCommerce design and development. SHFT integrates seamlessly with any team, working closely with brands on specific areas of focus.

SHFT clients include Habitat for Humanity and renowned jewelry designer Sidney Garber. SHFT supported Habitat for Humanity by creating a social advertising campaign that brought in nearly $700K and broke their previous fundraising record. With Sidney Garber, SHFT created and launched the company’s eCommerce platform, an in-store experience for their high-end clientele.

Recently, SHFT partnered with Daggers Football Club in England to overhaul its brand and Mental Golf Type, a company focused on unlocking golfers' mental state of play through personalized strategies, to accelerate its user acquisition strategy.

In addition to providing a solutions-based approach for their clients, SHFT is bringing to market a revolutionary marketing platform called TIDL. Leveraging the unparalleled power of AI and machine learning, TIDL provides a FICO-type scoring for a brand’s overall marketing.

“The synergy of content, web, and media fuels brand potential. When these components are in harmony, they create a seamless experience that captures users' attention and drives remarkable outcomes,” said Jason Jacquot, Head of Digital and Media for SHFT.

As an expansion of the N6 Group family, SHFT joins a portfolio of best-in-class companies, including the recent acquisition of West of Fairfax, an all-female powerhouse social team led by Courtney Lopez, KRMA – the engine behind the N6 brand – and Club Underdog, an ownership group whose football clubs include Brooklyn FC (USA), Dagenham & Redbridge (London) and Campobasso FC (Italy), with investors Mark Consuelos and Kelly Ripa.

"SHFT represents a natural evolution and expansion of the N6 Group brand," said Morgan Harris, CEO at N6 Group. "By harnessing the collective strengths of our diverse portfolio, SHFT’s think tank style allows for data-driven creative solutions to specific problems brands are facing by leveraging best-in-class creative, media and technology.”

With a focus on innovation, creativity, and results-driven strategies, SHFT is committed to pushing the boundaries of digital possibilities. Through this new venture, N6 Group solidifies its position as an industry leader, providing clients with access to a wider array of cutting-edge services and expertise.
