# Wire Media Group Expands U.S. Reach to 50M+ in 2024

Wire Industries, Inc., a technology and media company that owns and operates sports betting marketplace WagerWire, fantasy sports marketplace FantasyWire, and media division Wire Media Group (WMG), announced today it has hit a significant milestone in the growth of Wire Media Group. WMG content has been viewed over 250M times in the last year and has been featured in the New York Post, USA Today, Bleacher Report, ESPN, Bloomberg and CNBC, among others, collectively reaching 50M+ sports fans with its own content in the first half of 2024.

The Wire Media Group has rapidly risen in popularity, fueled by a community of sports fans and bettors enjoying viral stories of life-changing bets trading on the WagerWire marketplace, daily sports and betting news and analysis, and pop culture. “The Wire” is a content collective of top-tier creators and networks as well as original in-house content, with partners including Betr Media, Pro League Network (PLN), The Hammer Betting Network, East Coast Sports Investors, WalterPicks, and Brad Evan’s The Gaming Juice. The WMG content technology team, led by Allan Valle, has built and trained an A.I. content aggregation and amplification system to rapidly clip and syndicate partner content across mediums and channels. The cutting-edge system analyzes trends and cross-targets audiences, breaking partner networks and creators out of their algorithmic silos, resulting in increased discoverability. In addition to engaging content, WagerWire’s popular betting free tools including their Bet Value Calculator and Bet Graphs amass thousands of hits a day.

“We create content by fans, for fans and The Wire Media Group was engineered to have something to offer to everyone,” said Travis Geiger, Co-founder and Chief Experience Officer of Wire Industries, Inc. “It’s weird to us that companies who literally profit off their player’s losses are out there giving picks and advice – and worst of all, paying lip service to the idea of responsibility while laughing out loud about degeneracy. People are smart enough to see through the shill. The Wire doesn’t have a hidden agenda. We answer to our community and no one else and we have the freedom to be creative and honest in all we do. What we offer is different, and we’re pleased at the positive response we’ve received to date.”

The Wire Media Group also operates the company's affiliate marketing division, The Sports Influencers, which has seen tremendous growth in the first half of 2024. The program has seen 378% growth since the start of the year, growing 40% month-over-month, and has affiliate deals with FanDuel, Caesars, BetMGM, and Betr, to name a few. The Sports Influencers are operating in 23 states, Washington DC, Ontario and Puerto Rico.

WagerWire recently won the EGR Rising Star of the Year award and was shortlisted for Rising Star of the Year and Affiliate of the Year at SBC North America, as well as Best X Presence at the Hashtag Sports Awards. WagerWire was also named to Business Insider’s list of 25 promising sports startups to watch, according to VC’s and other top investors. FantasyWire was shortlisted as Innovation of the Year by the Fantasy Sports and Gaming Association (FSGA).

WagerWire burst onto the scene in 2022 with the announcement of a high-profile seed round led by Miami Marlins co-owner Roger Ehrenberg and including Betr/Simplebet Founder Joey Levy’s 305 Ventures, NBA All-Star Richard Jefferson, famed ‘Big Short’ investor Danny Moses, sports executive David Meltzer, and more.
