# Innovayte and Advyzon Partner to Create Single, State-of-the-Art Technology Solution

Innovayte, a custody and clearing firm that supports entrepreneurial registered investment advisors (RIAs) and wealth managers, and Advyzon, a comprehensive technology platform and portfolio management solution for financial advisors and investment managers, today announced the launch of their groundbreaking, state-of-the-art platform and model marketplace.

For Innovayte, Advyzon has created its first and only custodial back-end platform. The technology offers advisors a unique solution combining a separately managed account (SMA) and model marketplace with access to third-party asset managers – offered by Advyzon Investment Management (AIM), the turnkey asset management program under the Advyzon umbrella – all built from a unified managed account (UMA) framework.

“Technology is critical to helping RIAs reach their entrepreneurial goals,” said Cat Davies, Chief Executive Officer of Innovayte. “To truly empower advisors, we needed a new and fresh technology solution, not the same archaic legacy systems that fail to address the industry’s diverse needs. We’re excited to partner with Advyzon to give our advisors all the tools they need to grow and scale.”

A PARTNERSHIP TO PUSH THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY FORWARDAdvyzon’s intuitive, cloud-based technology platform offers a single solution that combines portfolio management, customizable performance reporting, trading and rebalancing, client web portals, CRM, client billing, and SEC-compliant document storage, customized mobile app and portal, as well as the model marketplace and investment management from Innovayte’s UMA/SMA platform via Advyzon Investment Management.

“We are proud to introduce the custody, clearing and investment management platform of the future,” said Lee Andreatta, CEO of Advyzon Investment Management. “When Innovayte approached us about a partnership, we jumped at the opportunity to help usher in a new era for financial custody and clearing, plus investment management. Unfortunately, most firms use outdated technology, and we hope this partnership helps push the entire industry forward.”

The Innovayte platform is the only technology solution that can effectively serve the unique needs of high- and ultra-high-net-worth clients, given the UMA framework and its inclusion of a full rebalancer, model marketplace, and access to third-party managers.

Key features include:

* Nucleus Model Marketplace, which gives advisors access to third-party strategists, risk models, and advisor-created models.
* Quantum Rebalancer, which gives advisors multiple rebalance and tactical trade tools, including location optimization, cash management, and tax-loss harvesting.
* Robust Trading Capabilities, including tax overlay and direct indexing options.
* SMA/UMA Structure, featuring single and multi-sleeve reporting and trading.
