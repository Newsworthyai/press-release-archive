# Elf Labs’ CEO Opening Live Q&A for Investors Amid Private Capital Raise

Elf Labs, which owns the intellectual property behind iconic characters like Cinderella, Snow White, and Peter Pan, is hosting an exclusive investor presentation and Q&A session as part of their latest capital raise.

Led by CEO David Phillips, the presentation will take place on August 15th at 2 PM ET.

Investors attending the webinar will be eligible for an additional 5% bonus shares if they attend at least 10% of the total webinar time.

Elf Labs’ Promising Property Portfolio

With over 100 trademarks and 400 international copyrights secured, Elf Labs is poised to monetize these assets in the 2T entertainment and merchandise market. Their licenses include Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty, and more. The company uses cutting-edge AR/VR technology to create high-resolution, immersive experiences. Their team includes Emmy award-winning creatives and former Disney Imagineers who have worked on franchises like Star Wars and Shrek.

Multiple Markets in One Investment

David Phillips, CEO of Elf Labs, says, “We are tapping into several revenue streams, including subscriptions, ad revenue, licensing royalties, and in-game purchases. This diversified approach ensures a steady income flow and reduces reliance on any single revenue source.”

Elf Labs recently secured investment from MaryRuth's Organics and formed a strategic partnership with E.L.G Foods to create Princess-themed salty snacks with collectible add-ons.

Phillips adds, “Elf Labs is not only creating new intellectual properties but also democratizing ownership. Investors will have a say in introducing new characters and will own a piece of the classic characters, fostering a deeper connection and sense of involvement.”
