# K3 Holdings and Alpine LA Properties Congratulate Team USA for Winning Paris Olympics Medal Count

K3 Holdings, a privately held real estate investment firm with extensive holdings throughout the United States and Alpine LA Properties, a leasing company providing newly remodeled apartments at affordable rates in Los Angeles, congratulated Team USA for their outstanding performance in the Paris Olympics. Following more than two weeks of competition and lifetimes of preparation, athletes representing the United States won 126 medals (40 gold) leading all other countries at the conclusion of the games in Paris.

"Congratulations to Team USA for showcasing the true spirit of excellence and determination, bringing home the most medals and making us all proud,” stated Michael Kadisha, a Principal of K3 Holdings. "Winning the most medals is a triumph of skill and perseverance, and more so, a testament to the unity and resilience that define the American spirit. Dedication, hard work, and a never-give-up attitude leads to greatness, and we are all inspired by the performance of our athletes in Paris.”

"In sports, as in life, the way we handle victory says as much about us as the victory itself. Gratitude and humility elevate every achievement. Winning with grace and losing with dignity are the hallmarks of true champions,” Michael Kadisha continued. “The K3 Holdings and Alpine teams were impressed at how Team USA proved themselves to be real winners by celebrating their victories while honoring their opponents with respect and gratitude.”

The Olympics serve as a unique platform where nations from every corner of the globe come together in a spirit of friendly competition. Beyond the medals and records, the Olympics foster an environment where cultural exchange and mutual understanding thrive. In a world often divided by differences, the Olympics create a space where adversaries can engage in dialogue, learn from one another, and find common ground through shared values of sportsmanship and respect.

"The Olympics is a powerful testament to how people from diverse cultures and backgrounds can come together to achieve greatness," stated Nathan Kadisha, a K3 Principal. "The actions of Olympic athletes in Paris show us that dedication, perseverance, and mutual respect transcend borders and ideologies. These are the values that can truly unite us and drive real change beyond the games."

“We are excited that Los Angeles will be hosting the Olympics four years from now,” Michael Kadisha said. “By watching athletes from rival nations compete with honor and integrity, in our own community, we will once again be reminded that even in competition, there is room for cooperation, empathy, and the possibility of resolving conflicts peacefully.”
