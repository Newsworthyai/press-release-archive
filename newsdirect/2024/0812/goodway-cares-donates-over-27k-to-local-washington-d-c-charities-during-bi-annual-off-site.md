# Goodway Cares Donates Over $27K to Local Washington D.C. Charities During Bi-Annual Off-Site

Goodway Cares, a 501(c)(3) charity arm of Goodway Group, is proud to announce donations totaling $27,285 to three local charities following Goodway Group’s annual all-company summit. During the summit, Goodway Cares hosted the Circle of Gratitude on the engagement floor, where Goodway employees shared gratitude and came together to support Washington D.C.-based organizations.

Through employee votes, the Circle of Gratitude selected Hero Dogs ($10,095), An Open Book Foundation ($9,095), and Together We Bake ($8,095) as recipients of this year’s donations. The incremental $95 is a tribute to Goodway Group’s 95-year history.

* Hero Dogs: Based in Maryland, Hero Dogs is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to improving the quality of life for our nation’s heroes by placing assistance dogs with veterans of the U.S. military and first-responders with disabilities. Hero Dogs provides customized training and lifetime support to enhance the services of community organizations.
* An Open Book Foundation: Founded in 2010 by Dara La Porte and Heidi Powell, An Open Book Foundation aims to connect authors with students in under-resourced schools. By bringing authors into schools and providing free books, the foundation fosters a love of reading and learning. Since its inception, An Open Book has hosted numerous events and donated thousands of books to students and libraries.
* Together We Bake: Together We Bake’s mission is to empower women facing barriers to employment by providing a comprehensive workforce training and personal development program. This initiative helps participants gain self-confidence, transferable workforce skills, and hands-on experience, paving the way for sustainable employment and self-sufficiency.

Nikki Charles, executive director of Hero Dogs, stated, “We’re thrilled to partner with Goodway Cares. With their support, we’re able to give more veterans and first-responders the service dogs they need.”
