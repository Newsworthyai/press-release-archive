# WagerWire Establishes Fantasy and Media Verticals as Independent Brands Under Parent Company Wire Industries, Inc.

Wire Industries, Inc., a technology and media company that owns and operates sports betting marketplace WagerWire, announced today the formal establishment of FantasyWire and the Wire Media Group as independent verticals. This expansion allows the company to operate fantasy sports products and other types of gaming independently of sports betting, while accelerating growth of its media and affiliate segments.

“This is a natural evolution of our business that we have been planning ever since we founded the company in 2021 as the corporate entity Wire Industries Inc.,” said Zach Doctor, Co-Founder and CEO. “Our sports betting marketplace WagerWire has demonstrated that players love the optionality provided by a liquid and open market for active bets, while delivering significant player engagement value and cost-effective user acquisition for our partner sportsbooks. Now, we’re introducing this same economic principle to fantasy sports and other types of gaming.”

* FantasyWire is now a separate consumer brand operating side-by-side with WagerWire under the Wire Technologies umbrella. FantasyWire is powering the first-ever DFS pick ‘em marketplace on RealTime Fantasy Sports (RTS), and with trading also available on the WagerWire app. On the RTS marketplace, players can post their line-ups for sale at any time or buy line-ups in progress using tools like suggested prices and deal scores. The technology behind FantasyWire was nominated for Best Fantasy Innovation of 2024 by the Fantasy Sports Gaming Association (FSGA).
* The Wire Media Group (WMG) encompasses the company’s media network, The Wire, and affiliate marketing division, The Sports Influencers. The group was launched in 2023 by creating original content that immediately catapulted WagerWire into the national spotlight, amassing hundreds of millions of views across social platforms and capturing the attention of ESPN, CNBC, USA Today, and the New York Post. In its first year of operation, WMG was shortlisted for a Hashtag Sports Award for Best Sports Betting Content and was shortlisted again in 2024 for Best X Presence, along with FOX Sports and the NBA.

Under WMG, The Wire is a content collective of top-tier creators and networks as well as original in-house content, with partners including Betr Media, Pro League Network (PLN), The Hammer Betting Network, East Coast Sports Investors, and The Gaming Juice. Content spans sports, pop culture, fantasy, sports betting, sports business, and regulatory developments.

“Media is an important piece of our ecosystem as it ties all our offerings together and drives a powerful flywheel effect,” said Travis Geiger, Co-Founder and Chief Experience Officer. “Our marketplace generates a never-ending stream of interesting line-ups and bet slips that we leverage as a source of viral content, leading to organic consumer awareness and more incoming action, and finding the next big story.” Geiger continued, “Then with our creator partners, The Wire utilizes purpose-built A.I. production services to aggregate massive amounts of daily content to generate snackable clips, search-optimized articles, and data visualizations to amplify discoverability and cross-pollinate different audiences.”

The company’s rapidly growing affiliate business, The Sports Influencers, also operates under the WMG division. Through a diversified strategy of social media services, events, and direct conversions, the company drives sign-ups to multiple affiliate partners, including FanDuel, Caesars, BetMGM and PrizePicks. WMG was shortlisted for SBC North America’s Sports Betting Affiliate of the Year award in 2023 and 2024.

Wire Technologies is also building additional gaming verticals including PonyWire, a marketplace for horse racing bets, ContestWire for entries in survivors, pools, and brackets, and DataWire, its in-house data department developing proprietary pricing models and betting tools, as well as insightful content and data visualizations.

Wire Industries Inc was established in 2021 and owns and operates Wire Technologies and Wire Media Group. Wire Technologies is the company’s marketplace division including WagerWire, FantasyWire, PonyWire and ContestWire, while Wire Media Group operates their always-on media network and affiliate marketing division.
