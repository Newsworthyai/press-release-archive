# HomeSphere and RM Interiors Partner on Flooring Savings for Homebuilders

HomeSphere, the leading platform connecting building product manufacturers to mid-market homebuilders, today announced its newest partnership with homebuilding industry service provider, RM Interiors.

With this unique partnership, HomeSphere’s network of 2,700+ U.S. builders now have access to RM Interiors’ (RMI) turnkey program which includes sourcing and installation of vinyl plank, tile, carpet and more from the nation’s leading flooring manufacturers.

"RM Interiors is one of the first HomeSphere partners to offer end-to-end purchasing and labor services,,” said HomeSphere President and CEO Greg Schwarzer. “RMI installs thousands of flooring units per month across the country in both new construction and renovation projects. Now, our builders can leverage their expertise to build more homes faster and improve margins.”

RMI is a full-service residential flooring installation partner with local warehouses and field teams across U.S. markets. Because RMI offers products, labor, installation, and stages from local sites, HomeSphere builders will save valuable time and cost on a home’s most expensive line item.

“Flooring is one of the most significant interior expenses on any construction project,” said RMI Director of Business Development Cole Bennett. “RMI’s system finds efficiencies by managing products, labor and installation under one brand and we look forward to extending those savings - and more - to HomeSphere builders.”
