Nuestro Studios, a division of Nuestro Stories, announced today the worldwide debut of the historical fiction podcast series ‘Bistec’, a universal, cautionary story of faith, patriotic fanaticism, and surveillance in Dystopian Cuba.

The eight-part limited series is launching with two episodes per week on Mondays in English and Spanish and is now available on all major podcast platforms, including YouTube in Spanish, and English, iTunes, Spotify, Audible and more. A visual trailer for the audio series, which represents the next stage of what producers believe will become a feature film, can be viewed here.

‘Bistec’ is the riveting story of a longtime Cuban Revolutionary and what happens when one of the nation’s prominent dissidents moves into his neighborhood, exposing secrets, upending lives, and testing loyalties. Set during the 50th anniversary of the Cuban Revolution in 2009, ‘Bistec’ unveils the contemporary world of Cuba’s enigmatic surveillance and snitches system, all within the framework of a compelling, emotional narrative filled with unexpected twists.

“Even though Bistec is rooted in Cuba, it is the story of MILLIONS of people who have no rights to privacy, and whose lives and very souls are subject to the whims of a Totalitarian state,” said series creator, writer and director Manuel Ruiz-Barrera. “With Bistec, we’re giving a global audience an opportunity to peer behind the facade of Cuban society with a sonic experience that is deeply cultural, profound, and even compassionate.”

Inspirations for ‘Bistec’‘Bistec’ was inspired by stories from Cuba’s widely despised but little known Comités de Defensa de la Revolución (CDR), the neighborhood government apparatus Fidel Castro cherished so much he branded “the vanguard of the Revolution.”

Bistec also leans on events from the life of Micaela Ruiz, the late poet grandmother of writer Ruiz-Barrera, as well as the strange adventures he experienced during four documentary photography trips he made to Cuba in the early ‘90s. Prominent dissidents Amaury Pacheco del Monte, and his wife Iris Hernandez, co-founders of El Movimiento San Isidro, served as key story consultants and also play characters in the series.

Producers and cast

Adapted from a screenplay written 15 years ago by Ruiz-Barrera, and masterfully sound engineered and edited by Jaime Almiral, Jr, the series took 15 months to produce. In addition to Pacheco and Hernandez, the production was also anchored by Ernesto Fundora, who was an assistant director, associate producer, and story consultant, as well as Efrain Gonzalez, and Felix Montelara, who executive produced the series, and Elena Ruiz, who served as an associate producer.

Bistec talent represents every single generation of Cubans, including children of dissidents, TikTok influencer and hip-hop artist Jawndarko, and Venezuelan influencer and actress Laura Termini. The musical score of ‘Bistec’, ‘Canción de un Disidente’, was composed by nine-time EMMY-winning Maestro Alberto Bade, and features a beautiful performance by the University of Miami Orchestra.
