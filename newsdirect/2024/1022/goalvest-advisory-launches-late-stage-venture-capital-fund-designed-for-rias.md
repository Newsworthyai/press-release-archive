# GoalVest Advisory Launches Late-Stage Venture Capital Fund Designed for RIAs

GoalVest Advisory, a female-founded registered investment advisor, today announced the launch of its Venture Growth Fund, allowing high-net-worth investors access to what it believes are some of the most sought after venture deals. Designing funds for registered investment advisors (RIAs) and their clients, GoalVest is leading the way in providing RIAs much-needed access to the Venture Growth asset class, which has exhibited tremendous growth as companies are typically staying private longer. The fund’s strategy will continue to follow GoalVest’s existing formula of using multi-channel deal sourcing to create a portfolio thoughtfully diversified across multiple thematic market trends in areas such as AI, SaaS, Climate Tech, Defense, Fintech, and Consumer. GoalVest has invested in numerous mid-to-late stage venture-backed companies in prior funds including: OLIPOP, CoreWeave, Anduril, Insomnia Cookies, Klarna, Apollo.io, Redwood Materials, Armada Systems, Shield AI, Aplazo, Cents, Cargomatic, and Animoca Brands.

“Almost 90% of US companies are private, so giving clients the ability to invest in venture capital has been an effective way to capture growth and, we believe, has differentiated us from our RIA peers,” said Sevasti Balafas, Founder & CEO of GoalVest Advisory. “We are excited to build on our success and offer this fund to RIAs looking for access to high-growth investments at reasonable fees and minimums.”

GoalVest is expecting to raise at least $50 million for the closed-end fund with only a limited number of slots available. Unlike early-stage venture, which offers more risk and a longer time horizon, the Venture Growth stage has a much shorter, two- to four- year investment horizon, and seeks a return of several multiples of invested capital.

"The timing is ideal for these types of investments given the depressed valuations we are seeing in the private markets right now,” said Blair Cohen, Chief Investment Officer of the Venture Growth Fund. “We are thrilled with the access we routinely have to high quality deals and our performance to date.”

GoalVest designed this fund with the RIA client in mind, offering:

1. Accessible minimums: with a minimum investment threshold of $250,000 the fund is accessible to a broader range of clients
2. Shorter lock-up period: unlike early-stage VC funds, GoalVest provides clients with a shorter time to liquidity
3. De-risked portfolio: the fund targets a thoughtfully diversified basket of mid-to-late stage venture-backed companies that offer much less risk than early-stage venture capital while maintaining the potential for outsized returns relative to public equities
