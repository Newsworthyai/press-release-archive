# Lisk Partners with Kotani Pay to Streamline Off-Ramps For Builders in Africa

Lisk, a leading Layer 2 blockchain dedicated to bringing Ethereum to emerging markets, is excited to announce its integration with Kotani Pay, a premier payment platform dedicated to connecting African users and businesses with stablecoins for local currencies. This partnership will enable projects and individuals holding assets on the Lisk protocol, primarily stablecoins like USDT and USDC, to exchange these assets directly for fiat, which can then be deposited into mobile money wallets.

As part of this integration, Kotani Pay has recently enhanced its capabilities by integrating with M-Pesa and various mobile money platforms across multiple African countries. This advancement empowers users and developers to off-ramp USDT or USDC on the Lisk protocol directly to mobile wallets via Kotani Pay, unlocking new opportunities for accessing fiat services.

“Emerging markets are at the heart of Lisk's mission,” said Dominic Schwenter, COO of Lisk. “We are deeply committed to empowering developers in Africa with the resources they need to create innovative web3 products. Yet, our efforts will fall short without robust on/off ramps—historically the Achilles' heel of crypto. Kotani Pay is addressing this challenge in Africa, and their partnership will further enhance our innovation in the region.”

This collaboration positions Lisk as the go-to RWA chain for African projects. With Kotani Pay's extensive reach across over 8 African countries, the integration provides access for projects to scale into different markets, supporting established and emerging initiatives. The significance of this partnership is underscored by a recent Chainalysis report indicating that stablecoins account for approximately 43% of the total transaction volume in the Sub-Saharan African region.

Felix Macharia, CEO of Kotani Pay, stated, “Our goal extends beyond providing access to Web3 assets in Africa. We are committed to empowering entrepreneurs and developers building Web3 products that drive economic growth across the continent. By integrating with the Lisk ecosystem, we offer dApps, DeFi platforms, and exchanges a seamless on-ramp and off-ramp solution, allowing them to unlock real value and expand their reach to underserved markets. This partnership aligns perfectly with Lisk's vision, and we are excited to support the growth of innovative solutions in the space.”

Integrating Kotani Pay's API and widget will facilitate seamless transactions, bridge real-world use cases, and enable faster, more efficient fiat on- and off-ramping. This enhancement aims to drive crypto adoption in Africa while increasing the utility of Lisk's infrastructure technology, solving a critical challenge for developers building on the Lisk protocol. In March, Lisk partnered with CV Labs to launch a VC-curated blockchain incubator program to support African entrepreneurs developing blockchain solutions tailored to the African market.
