# Nonprofit Photo Contest: Nonprofits Can Win $5000 in Cash Donations

A photo contest specifically for nonprofit organizations offers nonprofits a chance to win a total of $5000 in cash donations for the 25 winning photos. The grand prize is a $1000 donation.

The first, the largest, and the most popular photo contest exclusively for 501(c)(3) nonprofits (as far as we know) is back!

Sponsored by Nonprofits Insurance Alliance (NIA), the 2024 NIA Nonprofit Photo Contest is calling for nonprofits to share their best photo for this year’s theme: Community in Focus.

25 total winners will be selected:

* $1000 Best of Show (1 winner)
* $500 Standing Ovation (4 winners)
* $100 Spotlight (20 winners)

The contest is open to both NIA member nonprofits and any U.S. 501(c)(3) nonprofit that subscribes to Blue Avocado, a free online magazine for nonprofits.

Entries will be accepted online through Nov. 10, 2024.

Winning entries will be determined by a combination of popular voting and a review by an internal panel of NIA judges. Participating organizations are permitted to conduct independent outreach to encourage voting support among their constituents.

The public voting period will run online at NIA from Nov. 11 to 22, 2024. Winners will be announced on Dec. 10, 2024.

One entry per eligible nonprofit. Photos that are blatantly promotional and depict a brand or products of commercial value will be disqualified, as will AI-generated images or photos that have been altered or combined with other images or text. Photos must be appropriate for all audiences.

When applicable, a signed photo release form is required. Visit insurancefornonprofits.org/photo-contest for a complete list of contest rules and conditions.
