# Adro Teams Up with Shorelight to Improve Access to Banking Services for International Students in the US

Adro, a technology company offering no-fee checking and savings accounts, along with the Adro World Mastercard, is excited to announce its newest collaboration with Shorelight, the world’s largest platform supporting international student success in the United States. The two companies are teaming up to provide international students and workers moving to the US with seamless access to essential financial services prior to their arrival.

Shorelight, renowned for its comprehensive support services—including academic and admissions support, visa assistance, and career development—boasts a market presence in over 200 countries, a network of 9,000+ distribution points across agencies, schools, and counselors, and has the largest portfolio of US university collaborations in the world. This collaboration marks a significant milestone for Adro, which recently announced it had already welcomed customers from 110+ countries after launching earlier this year.

"We are thrilled to collaborate with Shorelight. They are a world leader in providing admissions support and services to ensure the success of international students arriving in the US. Adro's ability to support international students in opening their first US account before arrival, through a fast and efficient sign-up experience, naturally complements Shorelight's existing services," said Amarildo Gjondrekaj, Founder and CEO of Adro.

Gautam Bazaz, Head of Corporate Development at Shorelight, added, "Shorelight believes that every student deserves a chance at success in their academic journey. And, they are more likely to achieve their aspirations when they have confidence about what their US experience will be, before they move to the US. By working with Adro, our students can access reliable, affordable, and secure banking services, including access to funds in the US at a critical point in their lives."

Adro's checking, savings and credit card for internationals offer a range of benefits, including:

* No SSN, ITIN, or credit check required for sign-up
* $0 fees on all incoming wire transfers
* $0 foreign exchange fees
* No monthly fees and no minimum balance requirements

This collaboration underscores the commitment of both Adro and Shorelight to empower international students with the tools and support they need to succeed academically and financially in the United States.
