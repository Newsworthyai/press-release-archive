# Reid Hoffman Wished Death Upon Trump & Funded ‘Lawfare;’ He Must Be Removed from Microsoft’s Board & Defense Innovation Board

Following the assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump in Butler, Pa. on Saturday, National Legal and Policy Center (NLPC) is calling upon tech entrepreneur Reid Hoffman to resign his seat on the board of directors for Microsoft Corporation. Should he refuse to step down, then the Microsoft Chairman and Lead Independent Director must take steps along with fellow directors to remove him.

The shareholder group is also calling for Hoffman’s removal from the Defense Innovation Board (DIB), a body organized under the Federal Advisory Committee Act to make recommendations regarding technological modernization of the military. DIB is currently chaired by Michael Bloomberg.

At the billionaires’ retreat in Sun Valley, Idaho, this week, Mr. Hoffman reportedly engaged in a vigorous debate with fellow tech executive Peter Thiel over how the LinkedIn co-founder’s funding of “lawfare” has turned Trump into a “martyr.” According to a report by Puck News, Mr. Hoffman responded to Mr. Thiel, “Yeah, I wish I had made him an actual martyr.”

Previously, Hoffman was also widely known for introducing Jeffrey Epstein to other Silicon Valley figures.

According to Luke Perlot, associate director of NLPC’s Corporate Integrity Project:

“As shareholders of Microsoft, we call on Mr. Hoffman to resign, or be removed, from the board of directors. His ongoing presence on the board is a stain on Microsoft’s reputation and would implicitly condone his statements and actions.”

According to Paul Chesser, director of NLPC’s Corporate Integrity Project:

“Sarcasm or not, Hoffman has made clear that he doesn’t think Donald Trump has any civil rights, and that he and other billionaires should pick the president, not the American people. Some holders of great wealth seek to help the less fortunate or promote freedom and decency. Hoffman has instead sought to undermine democratic norms and values. We repeat our call that we made last year that Mr. Hoffman be removed from Microsoft’s board as well as the Defense Innovation Board.”

According to Peter Flaherty, NLPC Chairman:

“The Defense Innovation Board is engaged in the task of using technology to strengthen our defense in a dangerous world. It conducts serious business. It is no place for an unserious character like Reid Hoffman. For one thing, his associations with Jeffrey Epstein make him a security threat. For another, funding lawsuits by the likes of E. Jean Carroll and wishing martyrdom on Donald Trump should disqualify him from any government board or position.”

Founded in 1991, the National Legal and Policy Center promotes ethics in public life through research, investigation, education and legal action.
