For over a decade, Stupid Cancer has brought together hundreds of patients, survivors, caregivers, advocates, and health professionals at the largest gathering of the AYA community - CancerCon(R). Now gathering both online and off, every CancerCon event is an immersive experience, led by transformative connection and education. The majority of conference attendees are AYA (age 15-39) cancer patients and survivors, but caregivers and health professionals of all ages are also welcome. CancerCon Live is hosted in a different US city each year as we seek to make the event always be within reach of our community at all times.
