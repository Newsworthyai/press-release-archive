New contenders coming for Dogecoin’s crownDogecoin lays claim to being the OG meme coin, creating the blueprint for every single meme coin within the $57.6 billion sector. Dogecoin has come a long way from being an ironic take on the “wild west” era of the crypto world, growing to a $20 billion market cap. Early Dogecoin investors have made millions of times over their initial investments, especially those that sold at Dogecoin’s all-time high of $0.73 back in 2021. Today, Dogecoin serves as an “index” for the meme coin market.

However, the current Dogecoin forecast is bearish due to its large market cap, which severely restricts its growth potential. The Dogecoin forecast for 2024 is one of limited gains, with more capital flowing into lower-cap opportunities that have larger room to grow. The most bullish Dogecoin forecast predicts a 3x to 5x gain for the token should the next bull run materialize.

JasmyCoin price prediction for 2024 looking upJasmyCoin has turned in almost a 950% YTD figure as of press time, firmly outdoing the Dogecoin forecast within the same 12-month period. Here’s the cool thing about JasmyCoin: despite the 10x growth in the past year, The current JasmyCoin price is still 99.2% from its February 2021 all-time high of $4.99, indicating a potentially limitless growth trajectory.

That is, of course, if JasmyCoin bulls continue pushing prices as they have over the past year. If they manage to do so, JasmyCoin could outperform the Dogecoin forecast for 2024. However, JasmyCoin has a $1.78 billion market cap, with early holders selling off in favor of projects like Raboo.
