# AmeriLife’s HIPE Financial Welcomes 
Legacy Senior Benefit to Amplify Value Within the Final Expense Marketplace

HIPE Financial, an ORCA Life company and an affiliate of AmeriLife Group, LLC (“AmeriLife), announced today that it has partnered with Legacy Senior Benefit, a Kentucky-based final expense-specific insurance company with distribution networks throughout the southern U.S. Per the agreement, the terms of the deal were not disclosed.

“HIPE is focused on high performance, and we are thrilled to welcome Legacy Senior Benefit to our team,” said David and Lindsey Curry, principals of HIPE Financial. “The final expense market offers significant growth potential, especially given the power of our distribution channels with ORCA Life and AmeriLife. We look forward to continuing consumer awareness, customization, and value-added services for people looking to secure end-of-life expenses.”

In 2016, ORCA Life entered the final expense market to address a significant gap by adopting a unique personal and in-home service approach. Since then, this strategy has set ORCA Life and its companies, such as HIPE Financial, apart, enabling its agents to develop deeper connections with their clients and enhance their support to seniors for their end-of-life insurance needs.

“David and Lindsey continue to push the bar higher, strengthening our distribution and working to accelerate both business and producer success,” said Glenn Crabtree, founder and president of ORCA Life. “Our partnership with Legacy Senior Benefit is no different. Powered by a servant-leadership approach and value-based service offering, this collaboration has all the hallmarks of high performance, client trust, and care as we continue to achieve industry excellence as a final expense market leader.”

Legacy Senior Benefit’s network of agents will continue under the leadership of owner and founder Corey Price.

“Legacy Senior Benefit was built through a network of close friends and family,” said Price. “With a solid network of trusted agents, and now powered by one of the strongest distribution channels in the industry, we are ready for this next chapter of growth as we continue to serve our customers with end-of-life planning with trust and dignity.”

AmeriLife’s distribution platform offers partners a best-in-class business culture that boasts efficiency, value, and access to professional marketing services to increase productivity and bottom-line revenue. This is particularly beneficial in the final expense sector, where consumers look to provide peace of mind and tailored financial security solutions to meet their end-of-life expenses.

“We are thrilled to see our partnership with ORCA Life and HIPE flourish with the addition of Legacy Senior Benefit,” said Scotty Elliott, Chief Distribution Officer of Health for AmeriLife. “This collaboration will expand our holistic distribution capabilities and enhance our ability to serve our beneficiaries more effectively and set new standards in the industry.”
