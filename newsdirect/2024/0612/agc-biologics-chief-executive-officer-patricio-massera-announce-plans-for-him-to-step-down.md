# AGC Biologics & Chief Executive Officer Patricio Massera Announce Plans for Him to Step Down

AGC Biologics, a leading global Biopharmaceutical Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO), today announced that its Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Patricio Massera, will be stepping down from his role effective June 30.

Patricio Massera joined the company in 2012, as General Manager of the Copenhagen site at CMC Biologics A/S. He later served as Chief Operating Officer of CMC Biologics at its Seattle headquarters. He held the same role after CMC Biologics was acquired by AGC Inc. and formed AGC Biologics. Mr. Massera was appointed CEO in 2019. He also served as an Executive Officer of the AGC Life Science Company, the Life Science Division of AGC Inc.

During his tenure as CEO, Mr. Massera spearheaded several initiatives that elevated AGC Biologics' global business and brand. His work and achievements include key milestones such as navigating the COVID-19 pandemic, acquiring Molecular Medicine S.p.A. (“MolMed”) in Milan to create AGC Biologics’ Global Cell and Gene business, and acquiring facilities in Boulder and Longmont, Colorado to establish new large-scale commercial mammalian capacity and cell and gene services in North America. Mr. Massera also directed the company’s long-standing commitment to investing in single-use technology to ensure AGC Biologics could address the evolving needs of pharmaceutical companies using any platform process to develop new drug candidates.

“Over the past 12 years, I have had the privilege of experiencing the most vibrant and remarkable professional position of my life. CMC Biologics, and later AGC Biologics, have provided me with countless opportunities. I have met incredible individuals driven by the desire to build a better world, all sharing the common purpose of enabling our partners to cure life-threatening diseases and bring hope to life.” Massera said. “During this journey, we have managed to grow the business multiple times. However, like all great stories, every book has an end. In this case, it is just a chapter that finishes. AGC Biologics has a long and brilliant journey ahead, but it is time for someone else to write the next chapter.”

The new CEO search process is underway. In light of this transition, AGC Biologics is pleased to share Tadashi Murano, President of the AGC Life Science Company, will serve as interim CEO. He brings several decades of experience in global leadership roles within AGC Inc. across various business entities.
