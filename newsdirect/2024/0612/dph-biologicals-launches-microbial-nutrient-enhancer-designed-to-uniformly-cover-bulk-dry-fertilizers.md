# DPH BIOLOGICALS LAUNCHES MICROBIAL NUTRIENT ENHANCER DESIGNED TO UNIFORMLY COVER BULK DRY FERTILIZERS

DPH Biologicals, a leading developer and supplier of agricultural biologicals, has launched EnvelixTM Prime, a patented, biological nutrient enhancer designed to uniformly cover bulk dry fertilizer, delivering a robust biological consortium paired with fertilizer in a single application.

“Envelix Prime enables both retailers and growers to seamlessly unlock the value of biologicals on a broader scale,” said Mick Messman, DPH Bio President & CEO. “Just one pound of Envelix Prime evenly covers a ton of dry fertilizer, giving retailers a way to differentiate their fertilizer blends with biology while giving growers a single-purchase, single application route to enhanced performance and an increased return on their fertilizer investment.”

Envelix Prime contains naturally occurring beneficial bacterial and fungal microorganisms designed to accelerate and maximize fertility release using a patented carrier to adhere microorganisms to the fertilizer prill. In a tissue sample taken from a 2023 corn trial at the V3 leaf stage, Envelix Prime increased nutrient uptake of several macro and micronutrients when applied to MESZ fertilizer, including:

* An 18% increase in phosphorus,
* A 10% increase in sulfur.
* A 9% increase in boron.
* An 8% increase in copper.

Envelix Prime is DPH Bio’s first product to be powered by Prime™, a one-of-a-kind, patented spore priming technology that germinates beneficial bacteria faster, and in harsher conditions, enabling more consistent biological performance. In a recent corn trial, Prime enabled more than 70% of spores to germinate at temperatures as high as 98.6 degrees, while those without Prime germinated less than 10%. Additionally, nearly all spores with Prime germinated in high salt environments, while those that were not treated with Prime did not germinate.

Envelix Prime mixes seamlessly with MAP, DAP & Urea, offering improved flowability and less bridging at application.

“We are excited to get Envelix Prime out on the broad acre this fall enabling many growers the opportunity to experience the benefits of biologicals for the first time. This integrated approach requires no change in practice for the grower and, with the addition of Prime, we are confident that growers will consistently see the benefits this dynamic product unlocks both in the field and to their bottom line,” said Messman.

Envelix Prime is available now to retail partners and fertilizer blending facilities. For more information about DPH Bio’s technology platforms – RegenAphex™ and Prime, as well as DPH Bio’s expanded product portfolio, visit www.dphbio.com.
