# bluSPARC™ Expands Executive Team for Next Phase of Growth

bluSPARC, an innovator in connecting leadership development to organizational performance, announces two new members of its executive leadership team: Chief Growth Officer Michael Hubert and Chief Operating Officer Dr. Lori Bradley. Both professionals will impact client engagement with Hubert overseeing the growth strategy and Bradley managing interactions with clients and the delivery of bluSPARC’s high-touch approach.

Since launching in 2019, bluSPARC has worked with organizations from start-ups to Fortune 100 firms including Amazon, Chewy, Simple Tire, and 5.11. In the past year, the company has increased the number of leaders in its development programs by nearly 300%. Grounded in evidence-based leadership theories and shaped by its founders’ decades of practical experience, bluSPARC’s approach delivers measurable results for individual and organizational growth.

“With the addition of Lori and promotion of Michael to the executive team, we will be more strategic about innovation and expansion. As experts in organizational growth and performance, we knew the time was right to change the management structure and bring more expertise to the executive level,” said Co-Founder Kim Villeneuve, Ed.D. “Lori’s deep background in engagement management and talent development combined with Michael’s proven proficiency in client-centric growth strategies and data analytics will drive smart, sustainable growth.”

Bradley is a prominent leadership icon and influencer in talent management having held senior talent roles at a range of companies including Chewy, Amazon, United Airlines, and PVH, one of the world’s largest global apparel companies that includes iconic brands Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. She comes to bluSPARC as a former client which gives her a unique understanding of the organization’s approach to development and succession planning. In addition, she has served as Executive Chair of the bluSPARC Elite program since January 2024.

“bluSPARC’s focus on addressing the individual needs and leadership pain points of each client with its three-part approach of proprietary assessments, cohort learning for teams, and executive leadership coaching really sets it apart,” said Dr. Bradley. “After experiencing the program for myself and my work with companies through the bluSPARC Elite program, I know the changes this approach can make for executives and organizations. I am thrilled to be part of this next phase of the company.”

As CGO, Hubert will lead the strategic alignment of bluSPARC’s services to customize them for each client’s specific goals. He has been serving as bluSPARC’s Vice President of Finance, Technology, and Operations for more than two years and has a deep understanding of the company’s strengths and areas for growth. Hubert’s deep background includes work in investment banking at Meridian Capital, experience leading Analytics Strategy at Starbucks, and a Master of Information and Data Science from UC Berkeley.

“Michael’s talents add so much value for both bluSPARC and our clients,” said Co-Founder Andrew Rahaman, Ed.D. “His analytical background is essential for improving how we manage and implement our assessment frameworks to help organizations drive performance and growth. After working with us as a vice president, he knows the company and the best ways to optimize and expand so much of what bluSPARC does internally around technology, customer service, marketing, and financial functions.”

“It is rare for an executive coaching company to have the ability to connect data to behavior change. By providing these metrics, our clients can clearly see the return on investment of the bluSPARC approach. I am looking forward to increasing the use bluSPARC’s science-based methodology to do even more to improve leaders and help organizations thrive,” said Michael Hubert. “Despite our recent growth, I’ve identified a lot of untapped potential within the organization that we can leverage by using technology in more ways and establishing systems to support consistency and efficiency.”
