# XYPN Launches Sapphire, a Corporate Affiliation Model that Offers a New Path to Independence

XY Planning Network (XYPN), the nation’s leading support platform for independent, fee-for-service financial planners, today announced that it is launching a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) affiliation option—Sapphire—which will provide fee-only advisors with best-in-class technology, support and resources without the asset minimums, constraints or fees traditionally associated with joining a corporate RIA or broker-dealer.

With the launch of Sapphire, XYPN now offers two ways to join membership. The Emerald path offers all the familiar tech, compliance, community, coaching, advocacy, education, and resource benefits of XYPN Membership and is for those who prefer more flexibility and control over their firm's management.

Current Emerald members—and non-XYPN advisors—now have a second path: transitioning to Sapphire’s RIA affiliation model, created for those who want access to all of XYPN’s benefits, but prefer more support and back-office compliance, investment, and client-management outsourcing.

Unlike other RIA affiliation models, Sapphire members own their business, clients, and data, and can transition with 100% of their revenue to another platform anytime. As independent contractors, not W-2 employees, Sapphire members fully control how they operate their businesses.

“Too often, advisors strike out on their own so they can run their businesses how they want to, but then they join a corporate RIA only to end up back at square one, many times with even less control,” said XYPN CEO and co-founder Alan Moore. “We created Sapphire because many of our members asked for this option. They wanted a program that would allow them to focus on clients, not compliance and regulations. With the addition of Sapphire, fee-for-service planners have two paths to independence, and whichever one they choose, they can have the confidence of knowing that they are in control of their time and businesses.”

Because XYPN Sapphire is an SEC-Registered Investment Advisor, their practices can be registered in days, bypassing the lengthy state-level registration process required for advisors operating their own RIAs. For those registered in multiple states or facing increasingly difficult regulatory challenges, it also offers an opportunity to operate under the consistency of SEC-level regulations rather than at the state level.

Recently, Sapphire completed a pilot program, providing a select group of advisors with comprehensive support across compliance, investment management, bookkeeping and business coaching. XYPN is onboarding two to three advisors monthly and expects to transition roughly 50 advisors by the end of 2025 while also building out new service offerings across marketing, success coaching and community engagement.

“The team at Sapphire has been amazing,” said Brian Muller, founder of Momentous Wealth Advisors. “Since coming on board, I have not been on a call with Schwab Service once personally, and everything gets done timely and efficiently. I couldn't ask for a better partner to handle all the things I need done for my clients and to run my firm. I wanted to have my brand and vision but not be distracted by all the activities required of a state-registered RIA.”

XYPN’s Sapphire membership is affordable and transparent. Unlike other affiliation models with opaque pricing, Sapphire offers a simple fee structure: $1,500 per month and 20% of the advisor’s revenue.
