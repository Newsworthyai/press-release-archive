WHY: The need for donor breast milk is greater than ever. Donor milk plays a vital role in supporting infants in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) and families facing breastfeeding challenges. By opening this new collection center, we aim to increase milk donations from Santa Cruz County and surrounding areas to ensure that every baby who needs breast milk has access to it. This event is a chance for the community to come together and contribute to this life-saving mission.

Founded 50 years ago, Mothers' Milk Bank California is a leading nonprofit dedicated to providing screened, donated human milk to babies in need. As a founding member of the Human Milk Banking Association of North America (HMBANA), it helped set standards for nonprofit milk banks across North America. The organization collects, pasteurizes, and distributes safe human milk to hospitals and families, ensuring essential nutrition for infants. Committed to improving lives, Mothers' Milk Bank California supports families and advances neonatal care.
