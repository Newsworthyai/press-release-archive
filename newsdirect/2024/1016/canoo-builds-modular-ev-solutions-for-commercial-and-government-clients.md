Greg Ethridge, CFO of Canoo (NASDAQ: GOEV), was recently a guest on Benzinga’s All-Access.

Canoo Inc. is an automotive tech company that manufactures electric cargo vehicles for large commercial and government fleet customers globally. The company has developed design-forward electric vehicles with steer-by-wire technology on its common modular platform with end-to-end software plus power solutions. Ethridge told Benzinga that his company stands out for providing clients with full, long-term solutions rather than just the EV product.

Canoo’s production facility in Oklahoma will be the first automotive foreign-trade zone in the state.
