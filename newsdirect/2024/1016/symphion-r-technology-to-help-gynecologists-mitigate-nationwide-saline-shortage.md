# Symphion® Technology to Help Gynecologists Mitigate Nationwide Saline Shortage

As the nationwide saline shortage impacts healthcare facilities across the country and the number of elective procedures is being reduced or halted, The Symphion technology from Minerva Surgical offers a solution to help gynecologists mitigate the rationing of saline for operative hysteroscopy procedures.

A key feature of the Symphion Operative Hysteroscopy System is the fluid recirculation system. Unlike many uterine tissue removal products that use multiple bags of saline for operative hysteroscopy procedures, Symphion is designed to use one bag of saline during the uterine polyp or uterine fibroid removal. Symphion is the only operative hysteroscopy system with the capability to filter and recirculate saline for continuous use during each procedure.

In addition to conserving saline with the fluid recirculation feature, Symphion may improve procedural efficiency by eliminating a workflow disruption or stoppage to replace a depleted bag of saline. This is a common occurrence with open-loop, weight-based fluid management systems. Other features of the Symphion Operative Hysteroscopy System include.

• Volumetrically limit patient exposure to saline fluid absorption below the maximum AAGL guidelines of 2500mL

• One bipolar RF tissue resecting device to remove uterine polyps and fibroids

• Control persistent bleeding with optional coagulation function, which ACOG recognized as an advantage for a tissue removal device

• Maintain visibility with independent on-demand aspiration to flush the uterine cavity

• Optional digital fluid deficit readout device

Darin Hammers, Minerva Surgical Chief Executive Officer said, “Symphion was engineered to address the needs of operative hysteroscopy. We are proud to support our physician and health system partners with a solution to help navigate this critical saline supply shortage and help them continue to provide relief to patients that suffer from Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB).”

About Minerva Surgical: Minerva Surgical is a Women’s Health company committed to improving women’s health and quality of life by providing access to minimally invasive, technologically advanced, and innovative solutions for early detection, treatment, and management of uterine conditions.
