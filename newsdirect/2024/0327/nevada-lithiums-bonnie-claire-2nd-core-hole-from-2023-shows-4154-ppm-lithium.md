# Nevada Lithium’s Bonnie Claire 2nd core hole from 2023 shows 4,154 ppm Lithium

--News Direct--

Nevada Lithium CEO Stephen Rentschler joined Steve Darling from Proactive to share the core assay results for the second diamond drill hole, BC2303C, from the 2023 drill program at the Bonnie Claire lithium project in Nevada. This hole, drilled to a depth of 2,500 feet (762 meters), intersected high-grade lithium mineralization, with a notable 680-foot (207-meter) intercept—the thickest +4,000 ppm lithium zone drilled to date.

Rentschler emphasized that this intercept represents a significant discovery, as it confirms the presence of a high-grade mineralized zone exceeding +3,000 ppm lithium, with indications of further thickening toward the east. Importantly, the mineralized zone remains open in multiple directions, suggesting the potential for further expansion.

Furthermore, Rentschler noted that while the five holes drilled through this mineralized zone are within the planned PFS (Pre-Feasibility Study) resource upgrade area, much of the high-grade zone extends beyond the current resource limits. This indicates the potential for a positive impact on the PFS, prompting a re-analysis of the 2024 work plan to maximize the benefit of these latest assay results.

Overall, the successful drilling results underscore the significant potential of the Bonnie Claire lithium project, positioning Nevada Lithium for further exploration and resource expansion efforts to capitalize on the identified high-grade mineralization.
