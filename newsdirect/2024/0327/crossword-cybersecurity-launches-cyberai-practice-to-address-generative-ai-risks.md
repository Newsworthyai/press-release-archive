# Crossword Cybersecurity launches CyberAI Practice to address Generative AI risks

--News Direct--

Crossword Cybersecurity PLC group managing director Stuart Jubb discusses the company's new CyberAI Practice in an interview with Proactive London.

Jubb said the new "centre of excellence" is aimed at addressing the rapid implementation of generative AI (Gen AI) and large language models (LLMs) by companies. Jubb highlighted concerns from chief information security officers (CISOs) regarding the lack of understanding of the risks associated with these technologies.

The practice, part of Crossword's consulting business, aims to consolidate AI expertise into a centre of excellence, leveraging the company's deep knowledge in AI across its consulting and product teams. Collaborations with major industry partners, academics from prestigious institutions like Oxford University, MIT, and researchers from the Alan Turing Institute have enriched the practice.

Services offered include workshops to educate clients on AI risks, particularly the increased threat landscape and data integrity issues posed by LLMs. Additionally, Crossword advises on leveraging AI for business enhancement, focusing on automation and security product improvement, while also addressing the potential for AI to be used in cyber attacks.

Tools like Trillion HarVista are mentioned as integral to the company's approach, enabling rapid analysis of dark web activities and early warnings on cyber threats. This comprehensive approach aims to equip companies with the knowledge and tools to manage risks associated with Gen AI and LLMs.
