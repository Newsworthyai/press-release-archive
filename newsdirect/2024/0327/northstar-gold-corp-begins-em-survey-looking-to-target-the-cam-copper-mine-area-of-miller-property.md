# Northstar Gold Corp begins EM Survey looking to target the Cam Copper Mine area of Miller Property

--News Direct--

Northstar Gold Corp's CEO, Brian Fowler joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce the commencement of borehole electromagnetic (BHEM) and surface electromagnetic (EM) surveys at the Cam Copper Mine area on the Company’s Miller Copper-Gold Property in Ontario. The Cam Copper Mine is a historically significant site, characterized as a road-accessible shaft mine and a small-scale, past producer of high-grade ‘direct shipping’ copper ore, situated within the historic Boston Creek Copper Trend.

Fowler explained to Proactive that the Cam Copper Crone Pulse-EM surveys aim to delineate Cam Copper VMS (volcanogenic massive sulfide) horizon extensions and conductors across a 900-metre strike length towards the southeast. The primary objective is to identify areas with thicker accumulations of copper-rich massive sulfides. Additionally, a borehole BHEM survey will be conducted on the four Cam Copper diamond drill holes completed in 2023.

The utilization of Pulse-EM technology and surveys, similar to those employed in previous VMS discoveries across Canada, underscores the Company's strategic approach to exploration. Notably, Pulse-EM technology played a pivotal role in several past discoveries, including Hudbay Minerals' Lalor VMS deposit discovery in Manitoba in 2003.

The commencement of these surveys represents a significant step forward in Northstar Gold Corp's exploration efforts at the Miller Copper-Gold Property. By leveraging advanced surveying techniques and proven exploration methodologies, the Company aims to enhance its understanding of the geological characteristics of the Cam Copper Mine area. Ultimately, these surveys are expected to provide valuable insights that will guide future drilling activities and contribute to the Company's ongoing exploration success.

In summary, Northstar Gold Corp's commitment to utilizing cutting-edge technologies and conducting comprehensive surveys underscores its dedication to unlocking the full potential of the Miller Copper-Gold Property. With the commencement of the borehole electromagnetic and surface electromagnetic surveys at the Cam Copper Mine area, the Company is well-positioned to advance its exploration objectives and create significant value for its shareholders.
