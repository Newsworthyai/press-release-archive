# FeganScott Managing Partner Elizabeth Fegan Named to Inaugural 2024 Forbes Top 200 Lawyers List

--News Direct--

FeganScott Managing Partner Elizabeth Fegan has been named one of Forbes’ Top 200 Lawyers. Forbes debuts this inaugural list to recognize lawyers who are leaders in their fields, hold impressive track records in their specialties, and are highly respected by their peers and clients.

Since co-founding FeganScott in 2019, Fegan has established herself as a powerful force in a wide range of legal issues, including complex multidistrict litigation involving consumer fraud and privacy, sex abuse, and identity theft, among others.

“It is an honor to be included among such distinguished peers on the Forbes Top 200 Lawyers List,” said Fegan. “I have dedicated my career and my firm’s resources to securing justice for those who have been wronged and holding the powerful to account. I am grateful for the recognition of our work and thankful that my clients trust me.”

Under Fegan’s leadership, FeganScott has developed a sterling reputation for leading complex class action cases. Recently, Fegan was appointed to serve as counsel for the class members represented in the landmark multibillion class action settlements against major chemical companies— 3M, DuPont, Chemours, and Corteva. The combined $13.6 billion in settlements resolve claims that the companies contaminated the nation’s drinking water served by public water systems across the United States with PFAS, also known as “forever chemicals.”

The firm also recently announced preliminary approval of a settlement in its class action lawsuit against Hyundai and Kia on behalf of vehicle owners who claimed the automobile manufacturers sold millions of vehicles that do not contain a standard safety component to prevent car theft. The settlement is valued at more than $200 million.

In its groundbreaking work in representing survivors of sexual abuse, FeganScott secured a jury verdict in February of more than $10 million for ten customers of a popular Lancaster, Ohio, holistic health spa who claimed a former massage therapist sexually abused them during visits to the spa.

As with all Forbes lists, the Top 200 Lawyers List was compiled based on rigorous research and evaluation. Despite coming from different backgrounds, specializations, and geographic regions, all the lawyers on the list share a reputation for integrity and notable accomplishment.
