# Atha Energy set to begin companyâ€™s most significant exploration program ever

--News Direct--

Atha Energy CEO Troy Boisjoli joined Steve Darling from Proactive to unveil the ambitious plans for the company's 2024 Exploration Program, particularly focusing on the Angilak Project in Nunavut and its projects in the Athabasca Basin.

At the Angilak Project, Atha Energy is gearing up for an intensive diamond drilling campaign as part of its phase one program, scheduled to kick off in June 2024. The primary objective of this phase is to expand the Lac 50 Deposit, a promising asset that exhibits openness in all directions. With 10,000 meters of diamond drilling earmarked for this phase, the company aims to not only enhance the existing deposit but also unearth potential new discoveries within the vicinity. Furthermore, exploration drilling will be directed towards high-priority targets on parallel structures to Lac 50, previously identified as prime candidates for hosting uranium mineralization.

Looking ahead to Phase II, Atha Energy will embark on a comprehensive airborne geophysics program encompassing electromagnetic, Mag, and VLF survey types. This phase will be complemented by targeted ground geochemistry sampling and mapping activities. The overarching goal of Phase II is to pinpoint and de-risk a pipeline of additional high-priority targets, setting the stage for future exploration endeavors.

Meanwhile, in the renowned Athabasca Basin, Atha Energy is set to advance nine of its 100%-owned projects through a combination of ground and airborne geophysical surveys. By leveraging these techniques, the company aims to deepen its geological understanding across each project, thereby increasing the likelihood of making significant discoveries while optimizing capital expenditure for future drilling campaigns.

Notably, Atha Energy's exploration efforts in the Athabasca Basin will be further augmented by the incorporation of projects such as Gemini, pending the completion of the proposed scheme of arrangement with 92 Energy Limited. Gemini, which boasts the recently discovered high-grade GMZ showing, holds immense promise and will be seamlessly integrated into the company's broader exploration program. Atha Energy intends to provide a comprehensive update, including detailed drilling plans for the Gemini project, following the successful conclusion of the transaction.
