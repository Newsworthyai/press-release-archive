# Pegasus Resources releases positive results from sampling program at Energy Sand in Utah

--News Direct--

Pegasus Resources' CEO, Chris Timmins, joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce significant findings from the company's recent sampling program at the Energy Sands project in Utah, a past-producing site with uranium potential. Out of 41 samples collected during the program, 13 have demonstrated uranium (U3O8) grades exceeding 1%. Notably, sample ESRS24-016 returned an impressive 18.8% U3O8, while sample ESRS24-007 returned 3.5% U3O8.

Timmins emphasized to Proactive that the concentration of 18.8% U3O8 in sample ESRS24-016 validates the high-grade uranium potential at the Energy Sands project. These results significantly enhance the company's confidence in the uranium mineralization of the asset, providing crucial guidance for drill targeting and permit applications required to advance Energy Sands to a drill-ready status.

During the 13-day sampling program, Pegasus collected 41 grab samples using the RS-125 handheld spectrometer to identify areas of uranium mineralization. Notable samples were obtained from mineralized outcrops, tailings, and historical mine workings. This comprehensive geological mapping and sampling effort represent a critical step in advancing Pegasus' exploration activities, offering valuable insights into the uranium and vanadium potential of the Energy Sands property.

The company remains committed to leveraging this data for informed decision-making as it continues to pursue sustainable resource development. The promising results from the sampling program underscore the significant potential of the Energy Sands project and position Pegasus Resources for further exploration success in the uranium sector.

In summary, Pegasus Resources' recent sampling program has yielded encouraging results, reaffirming the high-grade uranium potential of the Energy Sands project. With a focus on strategic exploration and resource development, Pegasus is well-positioned to capitalize on the valuable insights gained from this program and drive continued growth in the uranium mining sector.
