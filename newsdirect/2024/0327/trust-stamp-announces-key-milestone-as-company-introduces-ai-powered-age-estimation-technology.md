# Trust Stamp announces key milestone as company introduces AI-powered age estimation technology

--News Direct--

Trust Stamp CTO Scott Francis joined Steve Darling from Proactive to unveil the company's latest innovation: its AI-Powered Age-Estimation technology. This groundbreaking solution is designed to enable both online and offline enterprises to estimate the age range of users based on facial image capture.

According to Trust Stamp, understanding the age of online users is of paramount importance. Not only does it ensure that services and content suitable for mature audiences are not accessed by minors, but it also safeguards platforms designed for young people from infiltration by adult users.

Francis emphasized that Trust Stamp recently participated in a competition against an industry leader in the age verification field. The outstanding performance of its deep-learning technology in this test has positioned Trust Stamp to negotiate the first commercial implementation of the age-estimation technology. This success underscores the efficacy and reliability of Trust Stamp's innovative approach.

The company offers flexibility in the deployment of this technology. It can be delivered as a Software as a Service (SaaS) application through the Orchestration Layer, as an on-premises installation, via a Software Development Kit (SDK) for integration into mobile applications, or potentially as a stand-alone application capable of running on the edge without Internet access. This versatility ensures that enterprises can seamlessly integrate the age-estimation technology into their existing systems and workflows, catering to diverse operational requirements.

In summary, Trust Stamp's AI-Powered Age-Estimation technology represents a significant advancement in age verification solutions, providing businesses with the tools they need to ensure compliance with age-related regulations and safeguard their online platforms. With its proven performance and flexible deployment options, Trust Stamp is poised to lead the way in enabling secure and responsible interactions in the digital age.
