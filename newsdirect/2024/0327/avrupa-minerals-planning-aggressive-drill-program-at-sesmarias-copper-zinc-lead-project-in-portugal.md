# Avrupa Minerals planning aggressive drill program at Sesmarias copper-zinc-lead Project in Portugal

--News Direct--

Avrupa Minerals CEO Paul Kuhn joined Steve Darling from Proactive to provide an overview of the company's ambitious plans for 2024, highlighting significant progress made in deposit definition work at the Sesmarias copper-zinc-lead Project in Portugal during 2023.

Avrupa Minerals is now gearing up for an aggressive drilling program in the SES Central Zone, which is set to commence soon. The success of this drilling phase will play a crucial role in determining the company's path towards applying for a mining license, which is anticipated to occur in the first half of 2025.

Additionally, Kuhn discussed the company's project in Kosovo. The project is located in the Vihanti-Pyhäsalmi VMS District in Central Finland and comprises two exploration permits covering known massive sulfide deposits (Kangasjärvi and Hallaperä), an application over a massive sulfide deposit (Rauhala), and an exploration permit covering a massive sulfide target (Kolima).

While awaiting the issuance of the Kolima permit, the joint venture is conducting basic exploration work, reviewing historic core and geophysical data, and modeling SkyTEM data from the Kangasjärvi license. These efforts have identified an outstanding un-drilled target near the old Kangasjärvi Mine, and plans are in place for drilling at this target in 2024. Additionally, there are other SkyTEM anomalies that may warrant drilling following planned exploration activities during the upcoming field season.

Overall, Avrupa Minerals is focused on advancing its projects in Portugal and Kosovo through aggressive exploration and drilling programs, with the aim of delineating significant mineral resources and ultimately advancing towards mining license applications.
