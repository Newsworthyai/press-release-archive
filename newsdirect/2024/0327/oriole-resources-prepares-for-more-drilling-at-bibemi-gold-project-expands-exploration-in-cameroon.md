--News Direct--

Oriole Resources PLC CEO Tim Livesey joins Proactive's Stephen Gunnion with and update on the companhy's Bibemi orogenic gold project in Cameroon.

The company is working in partnership with BCM International to expand and extend the mineral resource at the Bibemi site. Recent interpretation of geophysical data has identified several new geophysical targets, promising for the expansion of the project. This year's drill programme aims to confirm these targets, potentially adding to the existing mineral resource estimate (MRE).

Livesey highlighted the distinction between January's MRE upgrade and the current targets, emphasizing the addition of brand-new areas for exploration.

The 2024 drilling strategy focuses on defining resources at shallow depths and expanding the MRE, with expectations of drilling up to five new targets. Furthermore, Oriole and BCM are progressing exploration at the Mbe target, with results expected soon.

The company also plans to advance exploration on its other licences in Cameroon, signalling a busy year ahead with a growing local team. Livesey expresses optimism for significant resource confirmation in 2025 and maintains a dynamic exploration schedule across their portfolio.
