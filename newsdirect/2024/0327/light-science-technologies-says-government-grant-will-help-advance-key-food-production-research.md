# Light Science Technologies says government grant will help advance key food production research

--News Direct--

Light Science Technologies Holdings PLC (AIM:LST) CEO Simon Deacon joins Proactive's Stephen Gunnion with details of a £188,251 from The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and Innovate UK, as part of a £299,748 collaboration aimed at transforming food production.

The grant supports the development of sensors for monitoring soil conditions, complementing the company's existing air zone sensors. This initiative, led by Light Science Technologies in collaboration with Bridge Farms and Zenith Nurseries, aims to enhance crop yields and make agricultural practices more cost-efficient by optimising fertiliser and energy usage.

The project aligns with the company's broader goal of enabling continuous crop growth in controlled environments such as glasshouses and vertical farms. Deacon also highlighted the smart agriculture market's potential, noting a global value projected at $55 billion by 2032, with a 12% growth rate.

The company, which has established a global distribution network expects to integrate the new sensor technology into its SensorGrow product range for commercial sale after a 12-month trial period.
