Moving your belongings, picking up Marketplace purchases, and moving large amounts of storage or home waste just got easier thanks to Muvr.io. The on-demand moving app company is setting out to revolutionize an industry known for customer and worker dissatisfaction.

Vying to be the Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE: UBER) of moving, Muvr offers customers transparent pricing, quality service and on-demand booking, all through its easy-to-use mobile app. Users pick the date for the move and number of boxes, and Muvr takes it from there.

Muvr is also trailblazing in worker satisfaction. It treats its drivers and movers fairly, paying them a competitive rate and letting them choose when and how much they work. The positive impact there, then flows on to benefit clients. It’s something founder Rico Suarez, a professional mover for years, says wasn’t always afforded workers in the moving industry.

“In the early days of my career as a young and ambitious mover, I experienced firsthand the harsh realities of an industry where workers were often taken advantage of and undervalued,” says Suarez. “I toiled tirelessly, dedicating long hours and immense physical effort to help people move their cherished possessions, only to be met with low pay, little care, and an overall lack of respect. This was a turning point for me.” Out of that frustration, Suarez launched Muvr in 2023 and hasn’t looked back.

From customers to workers, here’s how Muvr is disrupting the moving industry with its on-demand service.

People Keep On Moving Muvr’s disruptive business model in the moving industry comes at a good time. Even after many people left cities during the pandemic, people are continuing to move within the U.S. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans move 11.7 times in their lifetime. The $21 billion plus industry is expected to continue growing for the foreseeable future. Beyond the U.S., Muvr also sees a substantial opportunity to disrupt the moving industry.

Currently, however, the moving industry is known for questionable service and outright scams. Murky pricing enables companies to hit consumers with unforeseen fees for anything from an extra pickup to additional insurance. People are fed up and are looking for better service and Muvr wants to deliver that by providing customers with full pricing transparency through the app.

Muvr’s pricing structure is clear, reasonable and free from hidden costs or surprises. Customers know exactly how much the move will cost them. From booking to paying and tracking, everything is at consumers’ fingertips, erasing the worry and stress that usually comes with moving. This commitment to transparency extends to the company’s gig workers, who are provided with detailed information about their compensation and job assignments. That, says Muvr, sets it apart and should ensure loyalty among its gig workers, as well as retainment of the best movers, which is also important to the success of an on-demand service. Less turnover means more dependability in the services it offers.

Its Service Is Resonating The strategy is paying off. Despite being in the early stages of its business, Muvr is already profitable and is optimistic about its growth potential. It runs a lean business, ensuring it is achieving operational efficiency.

It also goes beyond moving between apartments, homes and offices. Customers can also hire Muvr for same-day delivery of purchases from any store in its service area. The delivery is backed by Muvr’s multi-million dollar insurance policy. Users can further use Muvr to deliver couches, softs, dressers and other big items purchased through online marketplaces like OfferUp, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace and many others. Muvr will go 150 miles outside of its service area to pick up an item.

Then there’s Muvr’s junk removal service. With just a few taps on a smartphone, customers can book a team of two insured and vetted independent movers who will come to their location, remove their furniture and take it to a disposal or donation center.

Not only does Muvr save customers time and effort, it is also an eco-friendly solution for removing unwanted furniture. Rather than dumping your old furniture in a landfill, Muvr movers will work to find a disposal or donation center that can recycle or repurpose it.

Diversifying In The Marketplace By saturating the dynamic market with its on-demand services, Muvr ensures that its revenue stream remains diversified. That protects its revenue and provides several areas of future growth. Currently, it is operating across California, but it plans to replicate the business model in markets across the country and eventually internationally.

It helps that Muvr is growing organically through word of mouth, which not only helps keep costs down but is a testament to the viability of its business model. Satisfied customers are spreading the word because they like the service. They are also following CEO Suarez on Facebook and Instagram at substantial rates.

Muvr is shaking up the moving industry and aiming to be the Uber of its industry. For big and small investors it potentially provides a unique way to get in on a company that is trailblazing and transforming an industry urgently in need of change.
