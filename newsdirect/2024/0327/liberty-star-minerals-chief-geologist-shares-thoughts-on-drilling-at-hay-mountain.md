# Liberty Star Minerals Chief Geologist shares thoughts on drilling at Hay Mountain

--News Direct--

Liberty Star Minerals Chief Geologist James Bryce joined Steve Darling from Proactive to share news regarding the drilling progress on the Hay Mountain property. Bryce outlined details about two holes drilled so far.

Hole HM-117 was drilled at the center of the magnetic high and over the conductor identified by the ZTEM survey. The initial depth to bedrock on the drilling pad was 108', after which the drill encountered limestones of the Morita formation. The presence of Morita at this elevation suggested a faulting event, with a vertical offset of over 800'. To further investigate, the company decided to deepen the hole by an additional 500' and extend the overall program by 1000.

Bryce also told Proactive hole HM-001 was located 0.6 miles east of hole HM-117. This hole was collared on Colina limestone outcrop displaying polymetallic leakage textures at the surface, indicating elevated levels of lead, zinc, molybdenum, and sometimes copper.

Despite the collar of this hole being at a similar elevation as hole HM-117, it allowed the company to begin drilling approximately 1350' deeper into the stratigraphy compared to hole HM-117. At a depth of 420', the drill encountered the Horquilla Formation, known to host many copper deposits in the region. As the hole approached 1500', the company decided to deepen it by 1000' due to increasing alteration, the presence of minor sulfides, and extensive carbonate vein stockworks.

Despite budget limitations, the project has successfully de-risked, laying groundwork for future exploration. Bryce anticipates refining the drill program with a larger budget based on results. These updates provide valuable insights into Liberty Star's exploration efforts and the geological features encountered during drilling on the Hay Mountain property.
