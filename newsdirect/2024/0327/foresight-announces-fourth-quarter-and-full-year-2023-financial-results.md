# Foresight Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results

--News Direct--

Foresight Autonomous Holdings Ltd., an innovator in automotive vision systems (Nasdaq and TASE: FRSX) (“Foresight” or the “Company”), today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Foresight ended the full year 2023 with revenues of $497,000 and with $15.7 million in cash, cash equivalent and restricted cash.

The Company reported a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) operating loss of $16.3 million which is approximately a 7% decrease from the GAAP operating loss of $17.5 million reported for the full year 2022. Foresight reported a GAAP net loss of $3.6 million for the fourth quarter 2023, compared to a GAAP net loss of $3.8 million for the fourth quarter 2022, and a non-GAAP net loss of $3.3 million for the fourth quarter 2023, compared to a non-GAAP loss of $3.4 million for the fourth quarter 2022. A reconciliation between GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss is provided in the financial statements that are part of this release.

“In 2023, the world was captivated by the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize the ways in which we live, work, and travel,” said Haim Siboni, CEO of Foresight. “This excitement extended to the mobility and transportation industries, as Foresight and its subsidiaries and affiliates gained momentum and drew global interest in their AI-based technologies and other innovative solutions. Foresight recently completed two paid proof of concept (POC) projects with a leading Japanese vehicle manufacturer, demonstrating the widespread commercial viability of our solutions for 3D depth perception. These successful projects follow similar collaborations with leading manufacturers in China, Israel, and South Korea. Foresight continues to execute on its strategy of collaborating with some of the world’s largest Tier One automotive suppliers, indicating expansive and diverse potential for long-term growth."

“Foresight recently announced several milestones together with its wholly owned subsidiary, Eye-Net Mobile Ltd. (“Eye-Net Mobile” or “Eye-Net”). Eye-Net has successfully completed the technology validation phase of a multi-phase collaboration project with SoftBank Corp. (“SoftBank”). Moving forward, SoftBank will collaborate with its business partners to initiate sales efforts for Eye-Net's products in Japan. Together, we believe that Foresight and Eye-Net are poised to achieve commercial breakthroughs in 2024,” concluded Siboni.

Recent Corporate Highlights:

* Eye-Net and Softbank Corp. Successfully Complete Technology Validation Phase for Connected Mobility Applications in Japan: In March 2024, Eye-Net announced that SoftBank will collaborate with its business partners to initiate commercial validation efforts of Eye-Net's products in Japan. This follows the successful completion of the technology validation of Eye-Net’s products. SoftBank and Eye-Net have entered into a multi-phase agreement initiated in a paid technological POC, of which the first phase was successfully completed in November 2023. Through this collaboration, SoftBank will initiate sales efforts with its key business partners to move forward with the commercial validation of Eye-Net’s solutions, paving the way for improved collision prevention in Japan.
* Eye-Net Secures Follow-up Order from Leading Japanese Vehicle Manufacturer: In March 2024, Eye-Net announced that it has received an additional order for a paid development project from a leading global Japanese vehicle manufacturer, following the successful completion of the first two phases of a paid POC project. The parties engaged in a POC project back in February 2023. The successful completion of that phase is a significant milestone, demonstrating the feasibility and potential benefits of Eye-Net's technology for the automotive industry.
* Foresight Successfully Completes Project with Leading Japanese Vehicle Manufacturer: In February 2024, Foresight announced the successful completion of two POC projects with a leading Japanese vehicle manufacturer. The vehicle manufacturer evaluated the accuracy of Foresight’s unique automatic calibration capabilities to enhance 3D depth perception. Following satisfactory results, the parties are exploring co-development initiatives for further evaluation of the solution’s capabilities. Potential collaboration may involve integration of Foresight’s technology into the manufacturer’s passenger vehicles.
* Foresight Announces Pricing of $4.5 Million Registered Direct Offering: In December 2023, Foresight announced it entered into definitive agreements with institutional investors and insiders of the Company, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (through a company under his control), for the purchase and sale of 4,500,000 of the Company’s American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) at a price of $1.00 per ADS pursuant to a registered direct offering. The gross proceeds of the offering amounted to $4.5 million before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses.
* Eye-Net Selected by European Software République Consortium to Take Part in the Road Safety Revolution: Foresight’s wholly owned subsidiary, Eye-Net Mobile, signed an agreement to join Software République in November 2023. Software République is a European innovation ecosystem for intelligent, secure, and sustainable mobility, founded by Dassault Systèmes SE, Eviden, Orange S.A., Renault Group, STMicroelectronics N.V and Thales Group. Eye-Net was selected to join Software République’s incubation program for a project that will deliver an accessible vehicle-to-everything (V2X) road safety solution for all road users.
* Foresight Receives Notice of U.S. Patent Allowance for 3D Image Analysis System and Calibration Technology: in October 2023 Foresight received a notice of allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for its patent application, number 17/982,691, for “System and Method for Stereoscopic Image Analysis.” The patented technology enables the generation of 3D depth perception from any given pair of cameras, even those that have different optical properties and fields of view. The patent serves as the underlying technology of Foresight’s Mono2Stereo™ and Mono2Stereo™ 360° perception enhancement solutions.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Results

In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company's earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures of net loss for the period that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses. The company’s management believes the non-GAAP financial information provided in this release is useful to investors’ understanding and assessment of the company's ongoing operations. Management also uses both GAAP and non-GAAP information in evaluating and operating business internally and as such deemed it important to provide all this information to investors. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the company should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. Reconciliations between GAAP measures and non-GAAP measures are provided later in this press release.
