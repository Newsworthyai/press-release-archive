Based in Las Vegas, Galaxy Gaming has been in business for approximately 30 years, originating from the creation of the Lucky Ladies side bet. The company now offers a variety of games, including felt games, electronic table games, and interactive table games. Galaxy Gaming’s products are distributed globally, with installations in over 600 casinos and 76 cruise ships. The company offers traditional games like blackjack and baccarat, as well as proprietary games such as Easy Baccarat and Heads Up Hold'em. Known for its popular side bets, Galaxy Gaming holds five of the top seven blackjack side bets, including 21+3 and Perfect Pairs. The company has seen significant growth in its online presence, reporting 3.5 billion wagers on its games in the past year through partnerships with major gaming companies like Evolution and Playtech. Reback shared insights into the company’s Q1 financial results, highlighting record-breaking gross and net revenues achieved by significant margins. In the core sector of business, gross revenue for the quarter increased by $1 million, or 20%, and net revenue grew by $225,000. A key factor in this growth was the distribution of EZ Baccarat, which began in September 2023 and accounted for the bulk of the increase in recurring license revenue. The strong performance and market demand for Galaxy Gaming's innovative products and solutions. Additionally, the company has added Steve Kopjo as the new Chief Financial Officer. Kopjo brings a wealth of experience from senior finance and accounting positions held at various publicly traded gaming companies. He began his career at Ernst & Young as an auditor for casino operators, where he acquired his CPA license. Kopjo has developed a diverse skillset in technical accounting, investor relations, corporate finance, and mergers and acquisitions through his roles with both operators and suppliers, including SHLF Entertainment, Wynn Resorts, Play AGS, and most recently, as Vice President of Finance at Everi Holdings.
