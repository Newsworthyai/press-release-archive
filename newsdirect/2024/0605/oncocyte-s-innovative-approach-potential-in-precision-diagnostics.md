# OncoCyte's Innovative Approach: Potential in Precision Diagnostics

Chronic conditions such as organ transplant rejection and cancer represent significant challenges in modern healthcare, demanding precise diagnostic tools for effective management and treatment. For organ transplant patients, the risk of graft rejection remains a persistent threat, necessitating continuous monitoring to ensure long-term success. Similarly, the complexity of cancer requires advanced diagnostics to tailor treatments to individual patients, optimizing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing adverse effects.

Amidst these challenges, OncoCyte Corporation (NASDAQ: OCX) has emerged as an innovative player in the precision diagnostics market. The company's tests enhance clinical outcomes for patients undergoing organ transplants and cancer treatments. With recent strategic partnerships and regulatory advancements, OncoCyte has spearheaded transformative advancements in the field.

OCX’s product portfolio includes VitaGraft, a clinical blood-based test for monitoring solid organ transplants, and GraftAssure, a research-use-only test for the same purpose. Additionally, DetermaIO and DetermaCNI are designed for oncology applications, predicting responses to immunotherapies and monitoring therapeutic efficacy, respectively.

Partnerships

In April 2024, OCX partnered with Bio-Rad Laboratories (NYSE: BIO) to commercialize the GraftAssure assay. This agreement leverages Bio-Rad's extensive reach and expertise in the life sciences sector, facilitating the co-marketing of GraftAssure in the U.S. and Germany. Bio-Rad holds exclusive global distribution rights outside these regions. This collaboration is pivotal for scaling OncoCyte's operations and meeting the growing demand for transplant diagnostics.

The partnership also includes an option for Bio-Rad to acquire IVD commercial rights upon FDA clearance, subject to specific milestones. This option comes with a second equity investment into OncoCyte, reflecting Bio-Rad's confidence in the product's market potential. Riggs noted, "The QX600 ddPCR platform, along with their expertise in the life science market, makes Bio-Rad a natural partner for our transplant technology."

Financial Performance

OncoCyte's Q1 2024 financial results indicate a strategic focus on commercialization and cost-efficiency. The company reported gross proceeds of $15.8 million from an equity private placement, including a significant investment from Bio-Rad. This funding is crucial for advancing OncoCyte's product pipeline and expanding its market presence.

Operational efficiency is evident, with OncoCyte reducing its cash burn to $3.9 million, reflecting a capital-efficient business model. The collaboration with Bio-Rad and the anticipated commercial launch of GraftAssure RUO test kits in Asia, the U.S., and the EU are expected to drive revenue growth and broaden the company's market reach. Riggs remarked, "The collaboration with Bio-Rad is pivotal for the upcoming launch of our GraftAssure RUO transplant rejection diagnostic test kit and central to our mission of developing accessible point-of-care diagnostics and continuous innovation in transplant rejection monitoring."

Publication in New England Journal of Medicine

OCX announced a significant milestone on May 30, 2024, with the publication of promising data on VitaGraft Kidney in the New England Journal of Medicine. This phase 2 study highlights VitaGraft Kidney’s potential to revolutionize kidney transplant care by accurately monitoring graft health through measuring donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA).

For investors, this development signals substantial market potential. VitaGraft Kidney's ability to monitor therapeutic efficacy and detect disease recurrence opens new revenue streams. This test could become a standard in post-transplant care, driving repeated testing and long-term revenue.

VitaGraft Kidney addresses a critical unmet need. Up to 20.2% of kidney transplant patients develop antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) within 10 years, with no FDA-approved drugs currently available for AMR management. The combination of VitaGraft testing and felzartamab therapy offers a promising solution, potentially improving patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.

OCX CEO Josh Riggs emphasized the breakthrough nature of this study, stating, “This positions VitaGraft Kidney as a crucial tool in managing transplant health. Our recent partnership with Bio-Rad expands our capacity to deliver these innovative solutions globally.” Riggs highlighted the test’s competitive edge in detecting AMR up to 10 months earlier than current protocols, enhancing patient care, and strengthening OncoCyte’s market position.

The findings will be presented at the 2024 American Transplant Congress on June 3, 2024. This presentation is expected to further validate VitaGraft Kidney’s clinical value and could act as a catalyst for broader market adoption.

OncoCyte’s latest publication not only validates VitaGraft Kidney’s clinical potential but also strengthens the company’s market position. As OCX continues to innovate and expand its market reach, investors can anticipate significant growth opportunities in the precision diagnostics sector.
