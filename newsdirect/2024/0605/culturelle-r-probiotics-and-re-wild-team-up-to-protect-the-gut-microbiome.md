# Culturelle® Probiotics and Re:wild Team Up to ‘Protect the Gut Microbiome’

A new campaign from Culturelle® Probiotics and global conservation non-profit, Re:wild, is highlighting the similarities between endangered ecosystems on Earth and the endangered ecosystem within: the human gut microbiome. Recently, Dr. Robin Moore from Re:wild, participated in a nationwide satellite media tour to discuss the new initiative.

Earth’s ecosystems are what sustain us. They are our first line of defense against emerging diseases and climate chaos, and they provide everything from clean air and water to food and medicines. But research shows that the populations of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish have declined by nearly 70% since 1970. And a loss of biodiversity can significantly disrupt an ecosystem – lowering its productivity and quality.

The gut microbiome – made up of trillions of living, breathing bacterial species – is also facing a loss of biodiversity and is under constant siege from a variety of modern-day stressors, like anxiety, lack of sleep, and poor eating habits, that can put it out of balance and hinder its ability to thrive. This led the Culturelle brand to make a poignant connection between the vulnerable state of our gut microbiome and the other ecosystems of the world. The gut is a critical ecosystem — and it's at risk.

Culturelle Probiotics and Re:wild have teamed up to draw attention to the similarities between the endangered ecosystems of our world and the ecosystem within – the human gut microbiome – and raise awareness on the importance of protecting biodiversity in all ecosystems, both inside and out.
