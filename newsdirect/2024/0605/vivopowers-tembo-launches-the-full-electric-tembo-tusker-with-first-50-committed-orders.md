# VIVOPOWER’S TEMBO LAUNCHES THE FULL ELECTRIC TEMBO TUSKER WITH FIRST 50 COMMITTED ORDERS

Inaugural partner and customer trials have exceeded expectations

Tembo has an initial commitment of 50 orders worth an estimated US$2.5m

Tembo Tusker range complements current conversion kit program, offering more choice

LONDON, June 5, 2024 – the NASDAQ listed B Corp, VivoPower International PLC (“VivoPower”) announced today that its electric vehicle subsidiary, Tembo e-LV B.V. (“Tembo”) has secured its first 50 committed orders for the Tembo Tusker, its full electric pick up utility vehicle (“Tembo Tusker”).

The Tembo Tuskers come in both left-hand and right-hand configurations, with single and dual cab options available. They have a base range of 330 kilometres (with the option to extend to 1,000 kilometres), as well as a payload capacity of 1 tonne, and an unbraked towing capacity of 750 kilograms. Importantly they are priced at 15% below other comparable electric utility vehicles in the launch markets of Australia and New Zealand.

The initial order of Tembo Tuskers is being prepared for delivery to partners and customers in Australia, with full on-road homologation expected to be granted by July 2024.

The Tembo Tusker range will augment the Tembo conversion programs, increasing choices for Tembo’s B2B customer base and target market. Depending on where a fleet customer is in their fleet replacement cycle and/or depending on their strategic requirements and total cost of ownership considerations, Tembo will now be able to offer a choice of a full electric utility vehicle or a conversion of an existing utility vehicle. This expanded offering underscores Tembo's commitment to providing tailored solutions to meet the diverse requirements of its global customer base.

More broadly, VivoPower’s strategic focus remains on delivering purpose-driven sustainable energy solutions to electrify B2B fleets, encompassing aftermarket solutions, charging, digital twins, software and data analytics, aligning with evolving market dynamics and regulatory frameworks. The Tembo Tuskers will accelerate the pathway to delivering on this.
