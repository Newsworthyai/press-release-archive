# Direxion Launches META Single Stock Leveraged and Inverse ETFs

Following their recent success with Single Stock Leveraged and Inverse ETFs, Direxion, a leading provider of tradeable and thematic ETFs, today announced the launch of an additional pair, which allow active traders to obtain magnified, or inverse, exposure to the daily performance of the common stock of Meta Platforms, Inc. through either the Direxion Daily META Bull 2X Shares (Ticker: METU) or Direxion Daily META Bear 1X Shares (Ticker: METD).

“Although Meta has been around for over two decades, the company continues to evolve and innovate, cementing itself as a lasting leader in the tech space,” said Direxion Managing Director, Edward Egilinsky. “But that’s not without periods of short-term ebbs and flows, of which traders seek to take advantage.”

Offering ground-breaking products built for active traders, Direxion’s pairs of Single Stock Leveraged and Inverse ETFs are meant to be used for short-term trading purposes. These ETFs should not be viewed as buy and hold investments, but rather trading tools for traders with a high-risk tolerance. In addition, unlike traditional ETFs, or even other levered and/or inverse ETFs, these ETFs track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification.

"With the launch of METU and METD, Direxion is the only provider to offer Single Stock ETF pairs for all of the Magnificent Seven,” Egilinsky added. “Traders may respond tactically to headline news, earnings reports, and market sentiment for the Magnificent Seven on an individual basis via our Single Stock suite, or collectively with our recently launched QQQU and QQQD, which provide exposure to a concentrated basket of the seven companies.”

All Direxion leveraged and inverse ETFs are intended only for investors with an in-depth understanding of the risks associated with seeking leveraged investment results, and who plan to actively monitor and manage their positions. There is no guarantee these ETFs will meet their objective. Please visit the Direxion Leveraged and Inverse ETF Education Center, where you will find educational brochures, videos, and a self-paced online course to help you understand if leveraged ETFs are right for you.

A Fund’s prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other information about the Direxion Shares.

Investing in the funds involves a high degree of risk. Unlike traditional ETFs, or even other leveraged and/or inverse ETFs, these leveraged and/or inverse single stock ETFs track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification. Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying stock’s performance over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments. The Funds will lose money if the underlying stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Bull Fund will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance increases, and the Bear Fund will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance decreases, over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his or her investment in a single day. Investing in the Funds is not the same as investing directly in META.

Technology Sector Risk — The market prices of technology related securities tend to exhibit a greater degree of market risk and sharp price fluctuations than other types of securities. These securities may fall in and out of favor with investors rapidly, which may cause sudden selling and dramatically lower market prices. Technology securities may be affected by intense competition, obsolescence of existing technology, general economic conditions and government regulation and may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources, or personnel.

Meta Platforms, Inc. Investing Risk — Meta Platforms, Inc. is subject to a number of risks related to: its product offerings; business operations and financial results; government regulation and enforcement; the ability to collect and use consumer data; data, security and intellectual property; and the dual class structure of the company’s common stock, which limits the ability of shareholders to influence corporate matters.

Direxion Shares Risks – An investment in each Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. Each Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with a Fund concentrating its investments in a particular security, industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. A Fund's investments in derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other investments, including imperfect correlations with underlying investments or the Fund's other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility and lack of availability. As a result, the value of an investment in a Fund may change quickly and without warning. Risks of the Funds include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Derivatives Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Market Risk, Industry Concentration Risk, Cash Transaction Risk, Indirect Investment Risk, and risks specific to the technology sector and internet company industry. Additional risks include, for the Direxion Daily META Bull 2X Shares, Leverage Risk and Daily Correlation Risk, and for the Direxion Daily META Bear 1X Shares, Shorting or Inverse Risk as well as Daily Inverse Correlation Risk. Please see the summary and full prospectuses for a more complete description of these and other risks of the Funds.
