# Market Alert: Actelis Networks Receives Buy Rating and $5 Price Target from Analyst Theodore R. O’Neill

Actelis Networks Inc. (NASDAQ:ASNS), a leader in hybrid fiber-copper and cyber-hardened networking solutions, has received a vote of confidence from analyst Theodore R. O’Neill of Litchfield Hills Research. O’Neill has initiated coverage with a "Buy" rating and a price target of $5, citing Actelis’ innovative technology, growth trajectory, and potentially undervalued shares.

A Leader in Cyber-Hardened IoT Networking

Actelis (NASDAQ: ASNS) is a pioneering provider of rapid-deployment networking solutions for IoT and mission-critical broadband applications. The company's core technology enables fiber-grade performance over hybrid fiber-copper networks, a significant advantage for sectors needing cost-effective solutions without extensive infrastructure overhauls. The report also highlights Actelis’ "Cyber Aware Networking" initiative, which integrates AI-driven cybersecurity into its networking solutions.

The report underscores Actelis' "well-protected technology moat," supported by 31 granted U.S. patents and proprietary trade secrets, which give the company a unique edge in a competitive market. Its Triple Shield Protection technology ensures secure, high-speed connectivity across diverse media types, such as fiber, coax, and copper, enabling seamless integration even in challenging environments.

The analyst highlights the strength of Actelis' product portfolio, including the MetaLIGHT and GigaLine series, which address critical needs in intelligent traffic systems (ITS), military, utilities, and smart city projects. The report also notes the recent addition of the GL900 series, which offers ultra-low-power solutions tailored for multi-dwelling units (MDUs).

Strong Growth Strategy

The report points to Actelis’ strategic shift in 2023, where the company redirected its focus from legacy telecom customers to industrial and government clients. This shift has already shown results, with triple-digit year-over-year revenue growth reported in Q3 2024 and expectations of continued double-digit growth into 2025.

Additionally, the report emphasizes Actelis’ global reach, serving over 300 customers across 30 countries, and its blue-chip client list that includes government agencies, transportation authorities, and defense organizations. Notably, recent deployments, such as modernizing Washington, D.C.'s traffic network, highlight the reliability and versatility of its solutions.

O’Neill’s analysis suggests that Actelis shares, which closed at $1.03 on December 20, could be significantly undervalued. The report projects a $5 price target within 12 months based on discounted future earnings, using an 8% discount rate and assuming sustainable growth driven by Actelis’ innovative products and market position.

The report further highlights Actelis’ steep discount to peers, trading at just 0.53x 2025 market cap/sales compared to a peer group average of 4.3x. If the stock were to trade at the peer group average, its valuation could exceed $8.

The report also addresses several risks, including industry competition, regulatory challenges, and Actelis’ history of operating losses. However, it notes that financial risks appear manageable, with sustainable breakeven projected by late 2025 or early 2026 at quarterly revenue levels of approximately $3.4 million.

Conclusion

The initiation of coverage by Litchfield Hills Research marks an intruging endorsement for Actelis Networks. The report highlights Actelis’ robust technology portfolio, proven market presence, and significant growth potential as reasons for optimism.

Actelis’ innovative approach to leveraging hybrid fiber-copper networks and its focus on cybersecurity position it well to potentially capitalize on the growing demand for modernized critical infrastructure. Based on the report, As urbanization and IoT adoption accelerate, Actelis is could to capture a larger share of this multi-billion-dollar market.
