# HTX Ventures Invests in Lombard to Develop the Bitcoin Restaking Ecosystem

Singapore / July 8, 2024 – To enhance the liquidity and the ecosystem for Bitcoin, HTX Ventures, the global investment arm of the cryptocurrency exchange HTX, has announced a strategic investment in Lombard. Lombard is a restaking protocol poised to catalyze growth across the Web3 ecosystem by transforming Bitcoin from a static store of value into a productive financial asset.

Lombard builds its restaking product on top of the Bitcoin staking protocol Babylon, which allows individuals to use Bitcoin to secure other proof-of-stake networks. Lombard increases liquidity for staked BTC by issuing LBTC, a liquid and yield-bearing representation of BTC. LBTC can move seamlessly across chains and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms as collateral without compromising security. LBTC will soon be integrated into the most popular DeFi protocols on the Ethereum Mainnet before launching on widely used Layer 2 (L2) chains later this year.

“Liquid restaking is the next revolution for the Bitcoin Ecosystem, and Lombard is the project driving this transformation,” said Edward, Managing Partner at HTX Ventures. “Lombard is rapidly expanding to onboard the LBTC token onto major ecosystems and DeFi protocols. This will enable Bitcoin to be lent, borrowed, and traded, unlocking tremendous utility for Bitcoin holders and revitalizing the BTC ecosystem. HTX Ventures is incredibly excited to partner with Lombard to empower Bitcoin holders and the broader BTC ecosystem.”

“We are delighted to have HTX Ventures for investing in the development of LBTC as a new core primitive. LBTC will unlock a massive amount of net-new capital into the ecosystem and bring new liquidity and users to DeFi protocols and exchange platforms. HTX Ventures shares Lombard’s mission to accelerate on-chain finance and we look forward to building on these synergies to accelerate the growth of LBTC,” said Jacob Phillips, Co-founder, Lombard.

LBTC will soon be accessible to all and supported by all chains and DeFi protocols. Join the LBTC Waitlist for exclusive access to LBTC and rewards for early participation.
