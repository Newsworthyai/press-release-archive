# Restaking Sector Speeds Up Amid Miner Surrender

HTX's Liquid Restaking event has performed well since its launch, especially in earnings. According to the platform data, the number of the event participants has reached over 100,000 and the APYs hit up to 88%. Additionally, the active assets engaged in the event are steadily growing. It is reported that the upcoming airdrops from hot projects like zkLink and EigenLayer have the potential to reach an APY of over 100%.

In the aftermath of the late Bitcoin halving event on April 19, where the block reward for mining a new Bitcoin was cut in half, Bitcoin miners have begun to feel pressure and surrender. They may shut down underperforming equipment and start selling Bitcoin to hedge against risks. This traditionally signals that the market has bottomed out.

As such, the restaking sector, one of the hottest in the past half-year, is now in its prime. The airdrops of projects like BounceBit, ETHFI, and zkLink boast a market buzz.

Restaking Ignites New DeFi Possibilities

The past six months have seen restaking projects blossoming, with more than $20 billion assets engaged. This sector has attracted a wide group of builders, including renowned institutions like the Ethereum Foundation, Polychain Capital, ABCDE Capital, major platforms like HTX, Binance, and OKX, as well as other tycoons.

Compared to traditional staking, restaking allows users to re-stake their staked assets to generate extra earnings. This innovative model involves using smart contacts to ensure that the original staking and restaking are transparent and secure.

The emergence of restaking boasts a far-reaching, positive impact on the cryptocurrency market. Firstly, it provides crypto holders with more earning opportunities and boosts their participation in the market. Secondly, the multi-layered staking mechanism enhances the overall security and stability of blockchain networks. Additionally, restaking has catalyzed the emergence of more innovative projects and applications, further driving the development of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

According to the previous report, HTX, the world-leading exchange, has paid close attention to the restaking projects and accordingly increased its Liquid Restaking's quota to over $150 million.
