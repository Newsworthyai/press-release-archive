# HTX Ventures Announces Sponsorship of LSDFI Summit: Exploring the Future Development of LSDFI and DeFi

On July 8, 2024, HTX Ventures announced its sponsorship of the LSDFI Summit, a side event of the ECC conference in Brussels. Hosted by Tenderize, the LSDFI Summit is scheduled to take place this week on Monday (July 8).

According to reports, the LSDFI Summit is a crucial gathering that brings together leading figures in the DeFi space to discuss the latest technological breakthroughs and emerging industry trends. HTX Ventures, as one of the main sponsors of this event, also participated in the roundtable discussions, sharing its perspectives on the future of liquid restaking and the development of DeFi. HTX Ventures has always been committed to supporting and promoting the development of innovative technologies, with the LSDFI domain being one of its key strategic focuses.

Furthermore, Kelp DAO, Lombard, and Tomo, projects backed by HTX Ventures, will also make appearances at the event as sponsors. Kelp DAO is one of the leading liquid restaking protocols with $850M+ in assets under management across 45,000+ restakers. It facilitates liquid restaking for native ETH and LST across both the Ethereum mainnet and eight Layer 2 networks. Lombard is developing a Bitcoin restaking protocol designed to transform Bitcoin from a static store of value into a dynamic and productive financial asset. The goal is to contribute to the growth of the Web3 ecosystem. Tomo, an all-in-one Web3 social app, transforms users' online presence into a universal social wallet, fostering genuine, spam-free connections and financial incentives.

HTX Ventures is honored to support the LSDFI Summit alongside these exceptional projects. It looks forward to engaging with industry peers at the summit to discuss the future of LSDFI and DeFi. This collaborative effort will allow all participants to explore the future direction of LSDFI and DeFi more broadly, exchange valuable insights, and foster innovation that facilitates the development of the entire industry. Collaborating with its investment department, HTX is dedicated to actively monitoring and supporting the development of the LSDFI and DeFi sectors. It will provide professional guidance, consulting services, an extensive resource network, liquidity pools, and a user base for portfolio projects.
