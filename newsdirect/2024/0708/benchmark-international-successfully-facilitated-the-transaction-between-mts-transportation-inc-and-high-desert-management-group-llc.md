For over four decades, the company has continued to provide 3 PL services, full truck load transportation of refrigerated products, dry freight, flat bed, bulk carbon black, and bulk milk transportation on long or short hauls nationwide.

“Thank you for everything you have contributed to, the timely and knowledgeable direction and for always having the time to help where and when needed. It was so appreciated.” – Tim Merrill, CEO of MTS Transportation.

High Desert Management Group, LLC, a newly formed holding company in Texas, is looking to continue expanding its footprint in the Texas market with its experience in the trucking industry.
