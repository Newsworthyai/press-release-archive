# Volta Metals Expands Lithium Holdings with Strategic Acquisitions in Northwestern Ontario

Volta Metals CEO Kerem Usenmez joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce significant expansions in the company's lithium project portfolio. Volta Metals has acquired additional mineral claims contiguous to its Falcon West Lithium Project in northwestern Ontario. These newly acquired claims cover a substantial surface area of 820 hectares, effectively merging with the company's Falcon West and Crescent Lake lithium projects. This consolidation results in an extensive and strategically important land package within the Seymour-Falcon Lithium Belt.

Usenmez highlighted that Volta Metals now holds a 100% interest in these newly acquired claims. In exchange, the company has granted the vendors a 1.5% net smelter returns royalty. Further strengthening its position in the region, Volta Metals has also acquired the "Lee Creek" Project. This project is located within the same section of the Caribou Lake greenstone belt as Green Technology Metals' Seymour project and Midex Resources Ltd's Crescent Lake project. Both of these projects are noted for their outcropping lithium-bearing pegmatites, indicating promising potential for significant lithium resources.

These acquisitions underscore Volta Metals' commitment to expanding its lithium assets and enhancing its exploration capabilities. By consolidating these properties, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for lithium, essential for battery technologies and the global shift towards renewable energy sources.
