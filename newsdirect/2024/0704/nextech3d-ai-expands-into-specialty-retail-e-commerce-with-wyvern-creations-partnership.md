# Nextech3D.ai Expands into Specialty Retail E-Commerce with Wyvern Creations Partnership

Nextech3D.ai CEO Evan Gappelberg joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce an exciting expansion of the company's 3D business into the specialty retail e-commerce sector. This development is marked by the onboarding of their new customer, Wyvern Creations, the largest independent crossbow dealer in the country. Wyvern Creations plans to convert all its products into 3D models, enhancing the online shopping experience for its customers.

During the discussion, Gappelberg highlighted the accelerating growth of the 3D industry in which Nextech3D.ai operates. Wyvern Creations' owner reported that customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive towards the integration of 3D augmented reality (AR). This technology allows online customers to view crossbows in their own homes before making a purchase, significantly enhancing the shopping experience compared to traditional web pages and reducing the necessity of physical store visits.

Gappelberg emphasized that one of the key benefits of Nextech3D.ai's 3D modeling solutions is the ease of integrating 3D and AR assets on customer websites. The integration process for Wyvern Creations' online store was seamless, showcasing a wide range of crossbows using advanced 3D imaging. This allows customers to visualize and compare products in a realistic manner, including innovative applications such as video game tie-ins. The move to 3D models not only offers a significant upgrade to the online shopping experience but also positions Wyvern Creations at the forefront of retail innovation.
