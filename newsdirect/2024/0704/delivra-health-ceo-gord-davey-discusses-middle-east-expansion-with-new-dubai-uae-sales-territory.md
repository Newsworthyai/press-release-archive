# Delivra Health CEO Gord Davey discusses Middle East expansion with new Dubai UAE sales territory

Delivra Health Brands Inc. (TSX-V:DHB) CEO Gord Davey discusses the company’s recent expansion efforts in the Middle East during an interview with Proactive's Stephen Gunnion.

Davey highlighted a successful trip to Dubai, where Delivra has partnered to target the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a new sales territory. This move aligns with the company's strategy to expand its brand presence in the region. Delivra's product, Dream Water, which is already registered as a drug product and widely available in pharmacies across Saudi Arabia, will now be distributed throughout the UAE.

Davey acknowledged the challenges faced during the nine-month process of regulatory approvals but credited their local partner’s expertise in navigating these complexities. He emphasized the significant market potential in the UAE, driven by a growing population and widespread sleep issues, which Dream Water aims to address.

Looking ahead, Davey mentioned ongoing efforts to expand into additional territories in the Middle East, although he did not specify which countries due to pending regulatory approvals. He assured that the company is committed to global growth and will continue to update shareholders on progress.
