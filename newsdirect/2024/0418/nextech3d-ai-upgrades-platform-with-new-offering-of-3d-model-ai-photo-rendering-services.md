# Nextech3D.ai upgrades platform with new offering of 3D Model-AI Photo Rendering Services

--News Direct--

Nextech3D.ai CEO Evan Gappelberg joined Steve Darling from Proactive to unveil an exciting new addition to the company's offerings: Digital Photography and dynamic product visuals as part of its 3D model solutions. This enhancement means that every 3D model created by Nextech3D.ai will now be accompanied by stunning 2K, 4K, or even 8K photos, catering to the needs of its ecommerce customers.

Gappelberg explained to Proactive that this innovative AI tool is poised to drive significant revenue for the company. With each product listed for sale on an ecommerce platform requiring a minimum of six 2D photos, Nextech3D.ai is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for high-resolution images while simultaneously enhancing the value proposition of its 3D modeling business.

The company has already secured agreements with 10 existing customers for its digital photography offering, representing over 6000 high-quality digital photos. This offering will be available both as part of a comprehensive 3D model bundle and as a standalone product, catering to clients who already possess a 3D model and those seeking to tap into the ecommerce imagery market.

Nextech3D.ai's analysis indicates that creating and rendering 3D models is more cost-effective than traditional product photography, particularly for items that are expensive to produce or challenging to photograph in real-life settings. With 3D models, products can be easily manipulated and rendered from various angles without the need for physical prototypes or multiple photoshoots, offering unparalleled flexibility and efficiency.

As Nextech3D.ai continues to innovate and expand its suite of offerings, investors can anticipate further growth and market penetration in the burgeoning field of ecommerce visualization solutions. With its unique combination of cutting-edge technology and customer-centric approach, Nextech3D.ai is poised to revolutionize the way products are showcased and sold online. Stay tuned for more updates as the company continues to push the boundaries of ecommerce imaging technology.
