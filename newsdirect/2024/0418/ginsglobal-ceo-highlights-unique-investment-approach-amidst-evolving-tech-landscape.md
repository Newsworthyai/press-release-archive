# GinsGlobal CEO highlights unique investment approach amidst evolving tech landscape

--News Direct--

Anthony Ginsberg, CEO of GinsGlobal Index Fund joined Steve Darling from Proactive to provide an overview and update on the Tech Megatrend ETF. Ginsberg delved into the fund's global scope and strategic approach, highlighting its distinctive characteristics and investment strategy.

The Tech Megatrend ETF stands out for its global footprint, encompassing a diverse technology benchmark with approximately 60% exposure to the US market and significant allocations to Japan, China, and Europe. Unlike the NASDAQ, which is heavily concentrated in a few large tech companies, the GinsGlobal Index Fund adopts an equally weighted approach across its 120 holdings, with no single holding typically exceeding 2%. This strategy allows the fund to capture a broad range of technology sub-themes, including digital entertainment, social media, blockchain, electric vehicles, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and robotics.

Ginsberg underscored the fund's favorable price-to-earnings ratio, currently hovering around 18 times, indicating that its stocks are not overvalued compared to certain market segments. He also highlighted the potential for expansion beyond mega-cap companies, buoyed by positive economic indicators in the US and the possibility of lower interest rates, which could bode well for mid and small-cap stocks.

Regarding acquisition trends, Ginsberg noted the active involvement of both large and mid-sized companies in mergers and acquisitions, with mid-sized firms representing attractive targets that do not trigger antitrust concerns. He also discussed the potential impact of a strong dollar and the US government's initiatives aimed at reducing reliance on foreign technology, which could bolster North America's competitiveness and stimulate onshoring trends.

In conclusion, Ginsberg's insights shed light on the dynamic landscape of the technology sector and the strategic positioning of the Tech Megatrend ETF within it. As the fund continues to navigate market trends and capitalize on emerging opportunities, investors can expect to benefit from its diversified portfolio and forward-looking investment approach. Stay tuned for further updates as GinsGlobal Index Fund continues to drive innovation and growth in the technology space.
