ESE Entertainment Inc. (OTC: ENTEF), a leading global technology company that operates primarily in the gaming and esports industry providing crucial technology solutions to video game developers, publishers and brands, announced its partner Metapro launched a token sale Wednesday, April 17 – rolling out the $MPRO token at a starting price of $0.04.

Metapro is a blockchain company that ESE partnered with in the spring of 2022, enabling the entertainment company to expand its technology services to blockchain and cryptocurrency companies. As part of the collaboration, ESE provides technology and marketing services to Metapro, helping the crypto company grow its ecosystem and build awareness among the video game and blockchain developer communities. The goal is to unite the gaming and cryptocurrency communities.

“We have been actively working towards partnering with strategic companies that can drive growth. The opportunity in the metaverse and Web3 directly crosses into gaming, and we believe that ESE is uniquely positioned to provide technology and services to the metaverse,” Konrad Wasiela, CEO of ESE, said at the time. “We are excited to work with and scale new opportunities with Metapro.”

Metapro’s Token Is VersatileMetapro operates an all-in-one cryptocurrency wallet aimed at gamers, developers and creators who want to manage their digital tokens across different blockchains. With the noncustodial wallet, customers can store and transact with several cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana – and now they can add $MPRO to their list.

Metapro’s $MPRO token is designed to be versatile in the ecosystems, serving several roles including governance, transactions, rewards and acting as the currency for purchasing NODEs within the ecosystem. Eventually, the company anticipates that $MPRO will become an omnichannel token to increase accessibility and integrate with other blockchains. This will be made possible by the implementation of LayerZero. This development will enable $MPRO’s availability across multiple blockchain networks, enhancing its accessibility and utility.

Digital token holders will have a say in ecosystem decisions, and the token will serve as a primary payment method for transactions within the Metapro ecosystem. Users can also earn rewards through NODE participation in which providers contribute computing resources to Metapro Protocol’s distributed database, earning $MPRO and collectively fostering the network’s growth and diversity. The coins also fund the ongoing development and expansion of the Metapro ecosystem.

"2023 was a landmark year, and our work with ESE was pivotal in reaching these milestones,” Michał Bartczak, CEO of Metapro said earlier this year when announcing it is further expanding its partnership with ESE. “As we step into 2024, the cryptocurrency market has been growing fast and our focus is on developing and deploying new technologies. ESE has become a strategic partner with Metapro and we are excited to work together to enter new markets and execute on existing contracts and business globally.”

Celebrating The Launch To kick off the launch of $MPRO, Metapro is running three community reward campaigns with more than $340,000 in prizes. They include a Daily Telegram raffle in which participants have a chance to win one of ten daily prizes of 1,000 $MPRO totaling 130,000 $MPRO, the $MPRO TGE Celebration contest with a prize pool of more than $315,000 and the Zealy Campaign, which features a prize pool of 375,000 $MPRO.

The launch of the new digital token comes as interest in cryptocurrency is heating up again thanks to the launch of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved in January. Many investors are betting the SEC will approve other digital token ETFs beyond Bitcoin. The uptick in interest in crypto should be welcome news to investors, many of whom saw their holdings plunge in value in 2022 amid the collapse of crypto exchanges including FTX.

ESE is on the cutting edge in providing technology, support and services to its partners including Metapro. The launch of this token further cements the entertainment company’s position in the cryptocurrency space and puts it on the path to more potential growth.
