# Learning Technologies reports steady performance amid economic challenges

--News Direct--

Learning Technologies Group PLC chief executive Jonathan Satchell takes Proactive's Stephen Gunnion through the company's 2023 financial results, which reveal a slight revenue decline but rising profitability. Despite the economic challenges, the company maintained strong cash flow and increased its dividend by 5% to 1.2 pence.

Satchell highlighted the resilience of the company's long-term and SaaS contracts, which helped sustain performance amidst reduced corporate spending on employee development.

Operational achievements included retaining all client contracts above $10 million. The company saw some revenue declines due to reduced discretionary spending but reported growth in US government contracts and expansions in Latin America and the Middle East.

Another highlight was GP Strategies, which has more than doubled profits since it was acquired in 2021, benefiting from a commercial transformation program that improved margins without impacting customer service.

Satchell also noted the sale of Lorien Engineering, aligning with the company's focus on learning and talent development. This strategy, alongside prudent financial management, positioned the company well in the tough economic climate.

For 2024, the company anticipates revenues similar to 2023, with continued emphasis on acquisitions and leveraging AI in learning tools to enhance operational efficiency and data insights.
