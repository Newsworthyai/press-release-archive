# Powerhouse Energy completes key milestone for Feedstock Testing Unit with new kiln on the way

--News Direct--

Powerhouse Energy Group PLC (AIM:PHE) CEO Paul Emmitt has confirmed the completion of a significant milestone with the manufacturing of a 2.5-tonne-a-day kiln for feedstock testing by AGICO in China.

Emmitt detailed the company's progress despite previous delays caused by the liquidation of the previous manufacturer. The manufacturing process was verified by SGS, an independent verification company, which confirmed the quality of work and adherence to schedule.

In addition to the kiln, the development of the companyâ€™s facility includes the installation of ventilation systems and utilities, orders for a gas cleanup system from a reputed German company. Although the equipment will arrive sequentially, complicating installation, an effective installation plan is being developed, Emmitt said.

Emmitt also highlighted advancements in the Feedstock Testing Unit, designed to be flexible and handle various materials for R&D purposes. Orders for this system are expected soon.

The CEO expressed optimism about the feedstock testing unit being operational by the fourth quarter of the year, emphasizing the importance of safety and order in the process. Investor days are planned to allow stakeholders to visit the facility once operational.
