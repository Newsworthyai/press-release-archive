April 18, 2024 — Cure Alzheimer’s Fund, a nonprofit dedicated to funding the most promising research to prevent, slow or reverse Alzheimer’s disease, announced today that it has reached an important milestone—awarding more than $200 million in research grants to leading scientists throughout the world investigating the disease.

Since its establishment in 2004, Cure Alzheimer’s Fund (CureAlz) has supported more than 840 innovative grants led by more than 300 scientists resulting in 1,182 published peer-reviewed papers in prominent scientific journals. Many of these projects have yielded significant breakthroughs, resulting in findings contributing to new and critical avenues for development of novel treatments.

“CureAlz was founded with one mission: to fund research that will accelerate prevention, treatment and a cure for this disease,” said Henry McCance, Chair of Cure Alzheimer’s Fund. “Since the beginning, our approach has attracted others to join us in this fight, all who have been vital to what we have achieved. It has been an honor to deploy more than $200 million dollars in funding that is enabling and accelerating extraordinary research pursued by brilliant and determined scientists around the world.”

Funded projects have included:

· The Alzheimer’s Genome Project, the first large-scale, family-based study of the human genome specific to Alzheimer’s disease.

· Projects that explore how the body’s complex immune responses may contribute to Alzheimer’s disease.

· A consortium of experts to expand our understanding of the role the APOE gene may have in Alzheimer’s disease.

“For 19 years, our Founders and Board of Directors have been steadfast in their commitment to our mission to end the terrible burden of Alzheimer’s. The field’s top scientists contribute their expertise and guidance to CureAlz, meaning science and data are always our lodestars to a cure,” said Meg Smith, CEO of Cure Alzheimer’s Fund. “Our leadership’s vision, drive and generosity are matched by that of our dedicated donor and researcher communities. We celebrate this milestone as the shared achievement it is, and at the same time rededicate ourselves to accelerating an end to Alzheimer’s.”
