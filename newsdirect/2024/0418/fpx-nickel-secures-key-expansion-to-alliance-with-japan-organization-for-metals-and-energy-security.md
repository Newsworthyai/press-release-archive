# FPX Nickel secures key expansion to alliance with Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security

--News Direct--

FPX Nickel CEO Martin Turenne joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce an expansion of the company's Global Generative Alliance program with the Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC). Building on the progress achieved in Year One and the positive momentum generated thus far, FPX and JOGMEC have agreed to an expanded budget for Year Two of the program.

Turenne elaborated on the developments, emphasizing that the program will continue to focus on the global identification and acquisition of high-quality awaruite nickel properties akin to the company's flagship Baptiste Nickel Project in central British Columbia.

Under the expanded Year Two budget, the alliance's financial resources will increase from the initially planned $650,000 to $1,500,000. This significant boost in funding reflects the continued commitment of both FPX and JOGMEC to advancing the exploration and acquisition efforts in pursuit of strategic mineral assets.

The ongoing evaluations, spanning five international jurisdictions and three Canadian provinces, remain on track to define Designated Projects that will be joint ventured by FPX and JOGMEC starting in Year Two. Notably, the alliance has already staked approximately 120 km2 of prospective ground in British Columbia, underscoring the company's proactive approach to securing promising mineral tenure.

Looking ahead, FPX Nickel is strategically positioning itself for additional mineral tenure acquisitions within British Columbia, as well as in other regions across Canada and internationally. These efforts align with the company's overarching objective of identifying and advancing high-potential projects that complement its existing portfolio.

As the Generative Alliance program continues to progress, FPX Nickel remains committed to leveraging its partnership with JOGMEC to drive exploration success and unlock value for shareholders. With a strategic focus on securing promising mineral assets and advancing exploration initiatives, FPX Nickel is well-positioned for continued growth and success in the dynamic nickel market. Stay tuned for further updates as the company executes its strategic initiatives and pursues its vision of becoming a leading player in the nickel industry.
