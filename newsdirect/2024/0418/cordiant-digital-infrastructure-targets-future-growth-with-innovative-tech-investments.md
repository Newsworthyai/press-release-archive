# Cordiant Digital Infrastructure targets future growth with innovative tech investments

--News Direct--

Cordiant Capital CEO and managing partner Benn Mikula provides insight into the evolving landscape of digital infrastructure, underlining the significant impact of social and technological changes.

Through Cordiant Digital Infrastructure Ltd (LSE:CORD), Cordiant Capital invests in the essential components of the internet’s infrastructure, including fibre optic cabling, mobile towers, and data centres, which Mikula describes as the internet's "plumbing". These elements are integral to the transmission of data across an international network. Despite the complex and energy-intensive nature of this infrastructure, it facilitates global communication, exemplified by the potential routing of the interview through a data centre in New York.

Mikula highlights several trends affecting digital infrastructure: the need for expansion due to network congestion and regulatory impacts, the installation of 5G technology requiring denser network coverage, and the surge in demand for advanced data centres driven by artificial intelligence.

Cordiant Digital Infrastructure’s approach to investment is a "buy, build and grow" strategy, focusing on acquiring platforms with existing customers and expanding them, often pre-leased to reputable or governmental clients. The company successfully deployed its initial fund and plans to raise a second, targeting high-growth opportunities within digital infrastructure.

Mikula also discusses innovative solutions to contemporary challenges, such as leveraging existing sites for new data centres to minimise environmental impact and investing in renewable energy sources.

Looking forward, Cordiant Digital Infrastructure sees continued investment potential in towers, edge data, interconnect data centres, and backbone fibre networks, particularly in Europe and the United Kingdom, where the middle market offers attractive entry points and investment returns.
