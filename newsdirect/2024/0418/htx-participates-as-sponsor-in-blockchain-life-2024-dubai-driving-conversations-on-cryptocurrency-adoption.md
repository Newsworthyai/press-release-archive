HTX, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, secured a prominent presence as a registration sponsor and a sapphire sponsor at Blockchain Life 2024 held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates from April 15 to 17.

The decade-long exchange is committed to fostering innovation and development within the blockchain space. This strategic sponsorship not only allowed HTX to demonstrate its brand strength but also served as a platform to connect with a global audience of crypto enthusiasts and entrepreneurs, facilitating the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies.

HTX's professional and forward-thinking image resonated with attendees, garnering significant attention throughout the event. Additionally, HTX VIP Client Services Head Charmaine was invited to participate in theme-based panel discussions, where she engaged with industry experts to explore current trends, challenges, and prospects in the cryptocurrency market.

On April 15, in a panel titled "Conductors in the World of Cryptocurrencies: What Top Exchanges Think about 2024?", Charmaine highlighted the burgeoning growth of DeFi, NFTs, metaverse, and AI over the past two years and the emergence of innovative technologies and projects, particularly within the early-stage AI sector. She also expressed that HTX, as a leading exchange, recognizes its responsibility to drive the development of these sectors. According to Charmaine, HTX outlined its plans to foster collaboration with developer communities, organize hackathons, and identify promising projects at an early stage. The exchange further pledged to support these premium projects through facilitated listings, expedited market entry, and strategic guidance for operational and market expansion – all aimed at propelling the Web3 ecosystem forward.

Addressing security concerns, Charmaine emphasized HTX's commitment to user protection. The exchange leverages Merkle tree proof of reserves and third-party custody services such as Fireblocks to deliver a comprehensive security framework, ensuring a trusted trading environment.

Additionally, a series of HTX-hosted events will take place in Dubai to connect with top ecosystem partners and projects in the industry, media friends, and the blockchain community. This includes “Core's Bitcoin Social Afterparty” hosted by Core Foundation and HTX Ventures, and an exclusive meetup with HTX’s key market makers in Dubai.

Held on April 18, the highly anticipated HTX Dubai Whale Night will take place at an avant garde urban playground, Papa Dubai. Sponsored by DeepLink, a decentralized AI cloud gaming protocol, the theme of the event is "Innovators Unite, Pioneering the Frontier" and notable attendees include H.E. Justin Sun, a member of HTX Global Advisory Board, Edward, HTX Ventures Managing Partner, and Park JiHye, DeepLink CSO, who will each deliver a speech on the development of the cryptocurrency industry.

Dubai, as a leading hub for global blockchain development, serves as a testament to HTX's global vision and confidence in the crypto market. HTX's active participation in Blockchain Life 2024 served as a springboard for extensive dialogues with policymakers, industry leaders, and global crypto communities, further solidifying its influence in the cryptocurrency space. Moving forward, HTX remains committed to proactive dialogue with the industry to explore innovations and collaborations on driving global adoption and application of cryptocurrencies and shape a more open and interconnected Web3 ecosystem.
