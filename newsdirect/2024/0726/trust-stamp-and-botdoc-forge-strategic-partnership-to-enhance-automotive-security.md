# Trust Stamp and Botdoc Forge Strategic Partnership to Enhance Automotive Security

Trust Stamp President Andrew Gowasack and Karl Falk, CEO of Botdoc joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce an exciting new partnership. The collaboration aims to integrate Trust Stamp’s low-code Orchestration Platform into Botdoc Connect product, enhancing Identity Verification and Know Your Customer processes. This integration will include document validation using the Driver License Data Verification System provided by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators. Trust Stamp has obtained a license from AAMVA to access this system, ensuring accurate and reliable identity verification.

Trust Stamp and Botdoc have a history of working together in various industries, including banking, lending, and insurance. Both companies are graduates of the Independent Community Bankers of America ThinkTECH accelerator. They have observed a growing trend of criminals using counterfeit or altered driver's licenses, driving permits, and ID cards to commit fraud. With nearly 80,000 cars stolen from dealerships in the past year, the need for robust identity document validation is more critical than ever.

Through this partnership, Botdoc customers will be empowered to combat fraud more effectively. Trust Stamp’s low-code Orchestration Layer platform offers a variety of solutions, including the real-time capability to verify driver's license and ID information against data from the issuing agency. This feature significantly enhances the security and reliability of identity verification processes, helping businesses protect themselves and their customers from fraudulent activities.

The integration of Trust Stamp’s advanced technology into Botdoc's Connect product represents a significant step forward in the fight against identity fraud. It underscores both companies' commitment to leveraging innovative solutions to address complex challenges in the digital age.
