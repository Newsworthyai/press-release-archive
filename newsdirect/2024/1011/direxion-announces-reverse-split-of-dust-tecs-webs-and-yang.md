# Direxion Announces Reverse Split of DUST, TECS, WEBS and YANG

Direxion, a leading provider of tradeable ETFs, has announced it will execute a reverse split of the issued and outstanding shares of the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bear 2X Shares, Direxion Daily Technology Bear 3X Shares, Direxion Daily Dow Jones Internet Bear 3X Shares and Direxion Daily FTSE China Bear 3X Shares (the “Funds”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of this split, except with respect to the redemption of fractional shares, as outlined below.

After the close of the markets on November 1, 2024 (the “Effective Date”), each Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows:

As a result of these reverse splits, every ten or twenty shares, as applicable, of a Fund will be exchanged for one share as indicated in the table above. Accordingly, the total number of the issued and outstanding shares for a Fund will decrease by the approximate percentage indicated above. In addition, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and next day’s opening market price will be approximately ten- or twenty-times higher, as applicable, for the Funds. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the “NYSE Arca”) on a split-adjusted basis on November 4, 2024.

The next day’s opening market value of the Funds’ issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the reverse split. The tables below illustrate the effect of a hypothetical one-for-ten or one-for-twenty reverse split anticipated for the Funds, as applicable:

The Direxion Shares ETF Trust’s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust each shareholder’s investment(s) accordingly. DTC is the registered owner of the Funds’ shares and maintains a record of each Fund’s record owners.

Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split

As a result of the reverse splits, a shareholder of a Fund’s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional shares cannot trade on the NYSE Arca. Thus, a Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder’s fractional shares at the Fund’s split-adjusted NAV as of the Record Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder’s fractional shares. Otherwise, the reverse splits will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders for such redemption.

“Odd Lot” Unit

Also as a result of the reverse splits, a Fund may have outstanding one aggregation of less than 50,000 shares to make a creation unit, or an “odd lot unit.” Thus, a Fund will provide one authorized participant with a one-time opportunity to redeem the odd lot unit at the split-adjusted NAV or the NAV on such date the authorized participant seeks to redeem the odd lot unit.

They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by sophisticated investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.

Direxion Shares Risks – An investment in the ETFs involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The ETFs are non-diversified and include risks associated with concentration that results from an ETF’s investments in a particular industry or sector which can increase volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. The ETFs do not attempt to, and should not be expected to, provide returns which are a multiple of the return of their respective index for periods other than a single day. For other risks including leverage, correlation, daily compounding, market volatility and risks specific to an industry or sector, please read the prospectus.
