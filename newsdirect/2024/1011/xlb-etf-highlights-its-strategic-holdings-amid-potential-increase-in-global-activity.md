# XLB ETF Highlights Its Strategic Holdings Amid Potential Increase In Global Activity

The Fed started cutting rates in September in an attempt to spur economic activity. China has done the same with both monetary and fiscal easing. If successful, these moves could impact global demand for economically sensitive sectors like materials. Investors interested in this opportunity may want to consider the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLB), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that offers targeted exposure to the materials sector.

Comprehensive Exposure to the Materials Sector

The XLB ETF’s holdings provide a comprehensive snapshot of the materials sector, encompassing diverse businesses within chemicals, construction materials, packaging and containers, metals and mining, as well as paper and forest products. Currently, XLB's portfolio includes 28 companies, each contributing to the ETF’s robust portfolio.

* Linde (LIN): 17.57%
* Sherwin-Williams (SHW): 6.79%
* Freeport-McMoRan (FCX): 5.50%

These strategic holdings offer investors access to various facets of the materials sector, which can be advantageous during periods of economic expansion or increased infrastructure investment.

Steady Demand for Building Materials

The ongoing demand for building materials has been a critical factor in the growing relevance of the XLB ETF. As construction activities increase, there is a corresponding surge in the need for raw materials. This trend is further amplified by the recent focus on infrastructure development across the country.

Infrastructure Development Boost

The passage of the infrastructure bill has opened avenues for substantial investments in various fields, including transportation, broadband, and clean energy. This legislative development has the potential to further drive the demand for materials, making XLB a potentially attractive investment option.

Expense Ratio and Positioning

With an expense ratio of 0.09%**, XLB remains well-positioned to provide exposure to the materials sector. Its strategic holdings and the potential increasing demand for construction materials highlight its relevance in the current market landscape.
