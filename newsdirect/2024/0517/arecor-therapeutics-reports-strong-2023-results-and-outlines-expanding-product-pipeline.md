# Arecor Therapeutics reports strong 2023 results and outlines expanding product pipeline

--News Direct--

Arecor Therapeutics PLC (AIM:AREC)C CEO Sarah Howell discusses the company's 2023 performance and future plans with Proactive's Stephen Gunnion.

Howell highlighted that Arecor has seen significant growth, particularly with the launch of products incorporating its Arestat technology under a global licensing agreement, generating royalties. Six new technology partnerships were established with major pharma and biotech companies, offering potential for future licensing and market development.

Arecor focuses on diabetes and obesity, with clinical results for their proprietary product, AT278, expected soon. This highly concentrated, rapid-acting insulin aims to provide better glucose control for type 2 diabetics with high BMI and support the next generation of insulin pump devices.

Tetris Pharma, a subsidiary, has shown strong growth under new leadership, with product sales tripling to Â£2.9 million in 2023. Its lead product, glucagon, has contributed significantly to this growth.

Howell also noted the importance of technology partnerships and licensing programs. Arecor has entered into three active license programs and is progressing well with its partners. One notable partnership is with Medtronic to develop a concentrated, stable insulin for intra-peritoneal delivery, aiming to reduce hospital visits for patients with brittle diabetes.
