# Tackling Childhood Peanut Allergies

--News Direct--

Right now, more children in the U.S. are living with peanut allergy than ever before, and approximately 75% will not outgrow their allergy. Recently, Pediatric Allergist, Dr. Douglas Mack, and Sarah Korieshi, the Mother of a peanut allergic child, participated in a nationwide satellite media tour to discuss the impact on children and innovative new treatment options that can help.

The repercussions of this condition are profound, extending beyond mere dietary restrictions to impacting a child's daily life, social interactions, and overall well-being. The constant fear of accidental exposure and the potential for severe allergic reactions can also be extremely difficult for families to navigate.

The increase in prevalence over the past 20 years has driven a growing need for effective treatment options to manage the condition. For doctors, that means treatments that reduces the likelihood of an allergic reaction in the case of accidental exposure, and treatments that work within the lifestyle of the child and family.

The good news is that recent years have brought about a spate of new innovations in the allergy space. For example, there is currently an ongoing clinical trial evaluating ViaskinTM Peanut, a patch containing the equivalent of one one-thousandth of one peanut kernel. The patch is applied each day to a child’s back in order to build up a tolerance to peanut protein, making it less likely that a child will have a reaction after an accidental exposure.

For parents, a treatment like this would be life-changing, as a non-invasive option – something that can be incorporated into our busy lives, without any restrictions to regular activities. Having access to a treatment option that allows children and parents to participate in typical activities for a child, such as birthday parties, sports activities, attending camp, or even school, would give parents peace of mind and children the care-free life they deserve.

About Sarah Korieshi

Sarah learned that her daughter Zara had a deadly peanut allergy when she was just 9 months old. The first thing she thought was, not only how life-threatening eating a food can be, but also living with the constant fear of what may happen every time she eats. There has always been constant fear with how unpredictable a reaction can be, and the anxiety that comes with solely relying on avoidance really takes a toll.
