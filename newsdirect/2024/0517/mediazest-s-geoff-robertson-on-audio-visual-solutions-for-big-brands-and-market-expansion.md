--News Direct--

Mediazest PLC CEO Geoff Robertson gives Proactive's Stephen Gunnion an overview of the company's operations and recent developments.

Mediazest, an audiovisual solutions provider, operates in markets such as retail, automotive showrooms, and workspace offices. The company, established nearly 20 years ago, counts well-known brands like Pets at Home, Hyundai, and Jaguar Land Rover among its clients. Mediazest focuses on a holistic, consultative approach, ensuring high-quality delivery and ongoing support.

Robertson highlighted the company's European expansion with a Dutch subsidiary established in late 2022, which has enabled better service for EU clients. Following a challenging 2023, Mediazest has seen improvements in 2024, with a positive trading update indicating a strong first half and a promising second half of the year. Robertson mentioned the potential for both organic growth and acquisitions to expand their market presence, noting the ripe conditions for consolidations within the industry.

Looking ahead, Mediazest aims to capitalise on opportunities in digital signage, electric vehicle showrooms, and hybrid meeting technologies. Robertson expressed optimism about the company's ability to leverage these trends and deliver value to its clients.
