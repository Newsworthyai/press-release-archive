# Immunic chief medical officer discusses promising treatments to mark World IBD Day

--News Direct--

Immunic Inc (NASDAQ:IMUX) chief medical officer Dr Andreas Muehler discusses Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) with Proactive's Stephen Gunnion to mark World IBD Day on May 19.

Muehler explained that IBD encompasses Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, characterised by an immune response triggered by the interaction between gut bacteria and the immune system, leading to bowel wall damage and ulcerations. This condition affects 1-2% of the population, presenting significant social challenges due to symptoms like diarrhoea and abdominal pain, which can limit social and professional activities.

Currently, IBD is managed with immunosuppressive drugs, which, while effective, increase susceptibility to infections and other autoimmune diseases and often show immunosuppression. Dr Muehler highlighted the need for treatments that do not suppress the immune system. Immunic Inc. has been exploring new therapies, including a drug that strengthens the bowel barrier.

A recent phase two trial with Vidofludimus calcium (IMU-838) in ulcerative colitis showed promising results in maintaining remission. This drug, primarily tested in multiple sclerosis, is part of a class not previously tested in large IBD trials.

Another promising drug, IMU-856, aims to regenerate the bowel barrier, preventing harmful interactions between gut bacteria and the immune system without immunosuppression. This drug has shown positive results in animal experiments as well as in healthy volunteers and celiac disease trials. Immunic currently evaluates potential testing of IMU-856 in IBD.
