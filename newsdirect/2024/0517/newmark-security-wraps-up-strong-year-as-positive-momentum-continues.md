The UK-based firm, specialising in electronic software and security systems, has observed a positive revenue trajectory, reaching over £22 million.

Looking ahead, Dwek remains optimistic about the new financial year, pointing to a strong sales pipeline with potential in both hardware and software, indicating a continued upward trend in growth and expansion for Newmark Security.
