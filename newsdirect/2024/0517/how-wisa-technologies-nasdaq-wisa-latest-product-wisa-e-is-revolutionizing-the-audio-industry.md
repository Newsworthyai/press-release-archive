WiSA Technologies (NASDAQ: WISA) has emerged as a leader in the audio and video entertainment sector through its pioneering wireless technology. With its latest innovation launched in 2023, WiSA E, the company looks poised to revolutionize the industry and solidify its position as the premier solution for high-quality wireless audio for home entertainment (across multiple channels). This innovative spatial audio technology offers up to eight independent channels of HD audio, providing an immersive listening experience. WiSA E transmits and receives uncompressed 24-bit 48 kHz sound over a 5 GHz Wi-Fi network. As a result, users can enjoy high-quality audio without any lag or latency issues.

One of the key features of WiSA E is its interoperability with other certified WiSA E-enabled devices. The WiSA Association has established an interoperability standard that certifies products as compatible with each other, thus creating an industry benchmark for superior audio quality. This means that WiSA E-enabled products can work flawlessly with any other certified WiSA E-enabled device, providing a hassle-free setup. “This is a game changer in the industry,” shared Brett Moyer, CEO of WiSA Technologies. “WiSA E will be used by a major CE manufacturer to embed high-quality immersive audio functionality in their devices – functionality that can be activated by the consumer in their home. This is significant because this new model seeds the market with WiSA E and gives the consumer the ability to upgrade their home entertainment system at any time they choose. With this model, WiSA has a built-in aftermarket revenue stream for the major consumer electronics TV, projector, and set-top manufacturers with each activation of its software. This was a strategic move for WiSA Technologies to convert its award-winning hardware into a software model.”

WiSA Technologies Has Always Focused On Elevating Industry StandardsFrom the beginning, the company focused on assembling talented teams across various departments, including research and development, sales, marketing and management. This strong foundation allowed WiSA to consistently prioritize innovation and deliver superior entertainment experiences. The formation of the WiSA Association was a pivotal moment in the company's trajectory. With over 70 members, the association has helped foster relationships with leading consumer electronics manufacturers.

To ensure the success of WiSA E, WiSA Technologies has also introduced the Propel program, which encompasses several strategic initiatives. These initiatives include efforts to standardize industry solutions, achieve consistent revenue performance, reduce infrastructure costs and maximize long-term shareholder value. By forging partnerships with TV/audio speaker and chip manufacturers, WiSA Technologies aims to create new revenue streams through enhanced WiSA E technology.

The company has developed stringent specifications compliance and fostered close working relationships with consumer electronics manufacturers and chip makers, enabling WiSA to produce high-volume, lower-cost solutions that will have a direct impact on the company's bottom line. By expanding interbrand operability among premier audio manufacturers and delivering premium technology solutions to mass-market audio systems, WiSA is solidifying its position as an industry innovator.
