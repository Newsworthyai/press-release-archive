# A New Era for On-Chain Airdrops! HTX Liquid Restaking: Your Gateway to Effortless Airdrop Rewards

--News Direct--

Following the recent distribution of the first Merlin Chain (MERL) Airdrop, Restaking has once again taken center stage as a highly sought-after sector among investors in the crypto sphere. HTX Liquid Restaking has distinguished itself in this airdrop event by adhering to on-chain airdrop rules, offering lucrative yields, and providing individual users with the opportunity to receive up to 112,816 MERL tokens as airdrop rewards. Once more, these qualities have earned HTX praise and recognition from the investment community.

As the first exchange to introduce Restaking services, HTX Liquid Restaking has revolutionized how users participate in on-chain airdrops. With features like zero-threshold, no-staking, and no-lockup, it provides unparalleled convenience and flexibility, making it effortless for users to claim on-chain rewards.

No Lock-up, More Flexibility! What Else Makes Liquid Restaking on HTX the Preferred Choice?

Restaking, at its core, involves re-staking already staked crypto assets to earn additional rewards. HTX Liquid Restaking, however, breaks away from the conventional model of restaking, ushering in a groundbreaking new dimension for airdrops.

In comparison to on-chain staking, HTX Liquid Restaking eliminates the need for staking and lock-up assets, offering the following distinct advantages:

1. Easy Accessibility: Traditional staking models typically require users to lock up a specific amount of crypto assets in a smart contract for a set period to earn corresponding rewards. HTX's zero-staking, no-lockup model, represented by Liquid Restaking, revolutionizes the staking landscape by eliminating these limitations. Users can join the event at any time without the need to pre-lock their assets, significantly reducing the entry barrier.

2. Flexibility and Liquidity: HTX's zero-staking, no-lockup model guarantees users full control over their assets. With HTX Liquid Restaking available for both spot and futures accounts, users have the freedom to withdraw and trade their funds at any time without facing lock-up constraints. This flexibility empowers users to adjust their investment strategies according to market conditions, enabling them to seize opportunities more effectively.

3. Reduced Risk: Users do not need to perform complex on-chain transfers, mitigating potential asset risks linked to improper management of on-chain wallets.

4. Enhanced User Participation: HTX's zero-staking, no-lockup model allows participants to join the event at any time and earn rewards effortlessly, boosting user enthusiasm and investment drive. Conversely, traditional staking models, which often require prolonged asset lock-up, make participants more cautious and hesitant.

Therefore, HTX's Liquid Restaking, characterized by its zero-staking, no-lockup model, is uniquely designed to cater to user needs. This approach empowers participants to join the event at any time and effortlessly earn airdrop rewards, free from the constraints of asset lock-ups. This truly provides participants with a straightforward participation experience.
