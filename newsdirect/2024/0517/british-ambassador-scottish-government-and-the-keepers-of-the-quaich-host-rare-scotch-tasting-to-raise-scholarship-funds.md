# British Ambassador, Scottish Government, and the Keepers of the Quaich, Host Rare Scotch Tasting to Raise Scholarship Funds

--News Direct--

The British Ambassador Dame Karen Pierce, DCMG, the Scottish Government, and the Keepers of the Quaich USA (KOTQUSA.org), the US arm of the international Scotch heritage society, hosted a gala at the Ambassador’s official residence to celebrate the King of Spirits and raise scholarship funds.

This exclusive gathering to sample rare whiskies and new expressions brought together a distinguished group of guests, including members of Congress; senior Administration officials; media; top industry executives; major trade association heads; other ambassadors; and members of Keepers of the Quaich USA society.

The evening benefited the Entrepreneurial Scotland Foundation (EntrepreneurialScotland.com), a charity dedicated to creating scholarship opportunities in the U.S. for Scottish students, many of whom are first-generation college students, and the foundation's support plays a vital role in their academic success.

The Ambassador welcomed the 2024 Gathering saying, “Thank you for joining us in celebrating Scotch Whisky, while raising funds for ESF scholarships. These rarities and new expressions demonstrate the range and vibrancy of the category and its long heritage. From the Highlands to Speyside, from Orkney to Islay, the diversity of Scotland’s whiskies is treasured around the globe.”

Chris Thomson, Head of the Scottish Government in the USA, added, “We are delighted to be able to support Keepers of the Quaich USA and the Entrepreneurial Scotland Foundation, bringing top students at Scottish universities to the US for internships. Scotland is rightly proud of our whisky, and also of our incredible higher education sector – both contribute both to stronger communities and economies at home, and to our transatlantic relationship with the US. To be able to support both tonight, and sample these incredible whiskies, is a great pleasure.”

KOTQUSA Co-chair and Diageo NA CMO Ed Pilkington pointed out, “While Scotch whisky is exported to well over 100 countries around the globe, the United States is by far its most valuable market.”

KOTQUSA Co-chair Frank Coleman added, “American consumers continue to savor super premium blends and single malts, with over nine million cases sold last year, worth over $2.5 billion to distillers, and much more to distributors and retailers across the country.”

The event featured eight individual company sampling tables as well as a full bar where cocktails were served with premium mixers provided by Fever Tree. In the fountain courtyard there was a cigar lounge sponsored by Cigar Aficionado magazine.

The guests also enjoyed pairing the whiskies with a lavish buffet of fresh Scottish seafood supplied by Seafood Scotland —artfully prepared by embassy Chef Craig Harnden, as well as cheese provided by Lactalis and oatcakes provided by Nairn’s.

Keeping Scottish tradition alive, the evening’s toast featured the Scottish Quaich, also known as the ‘Cup of Friendship,’ the two-handled drinking vessel that dates back to the 16th century, from which the Society takes its name. Founded in 1988 and headquartered at Blair Castle in the Scottish Highlands, the Keepers of the Quaich honors individuals who have made significant contributions to the world of Scotch whisky. With around 3000 Keepers from more than 100 countries, the society fosters camaraderie and appreciation for this iconic spirit. The US Chapter has approximately 300 members, many from C-Suites of all three tiers of the industry.
