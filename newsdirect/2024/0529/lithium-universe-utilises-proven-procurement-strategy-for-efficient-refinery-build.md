# Lithium Universe utilises proven procurement strategy for efficient refinery build

Lithium Universe Ltd (ASX:LU7) will implement the 'same equipment, same supplier' procurement strategy for its planned Bécancour Lithium Refinery in Québec, Canada. This strategy, previously successful at Galaxy Resources’ project, involves using proven equipment designs from top-quality suppliers. Key LU7 personnel visited Hatch Ltd’s Shanghai office and suppliers to solidify this approach, ensuring reliable quality and reducing engineering work for the project’s definitive feasibility study (DFS). This strategy is expected to expedite the engineering process, reduce costs and leverage suppliers' experience to mitigate scheduling disruptions. The company aims to bridge North America's lithium conversion gap and support Canada’s battery supply chain. Test work at Linyi University Lithium Research Centre demonstrated that Bécancour’s design could produce battery-grade lithium carbonate from various spodumene concentrates, meeting stringent specifications. The facility's ongoing test program is crucial for the DFS, with results validating the process design. LU7 plans to establish a vertically integrated lithium processing hub, leveraging its design's flexibility to process feedstocks from multiple sources globally.
