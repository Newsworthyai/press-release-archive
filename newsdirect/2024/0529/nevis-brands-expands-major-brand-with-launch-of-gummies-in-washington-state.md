# Nevis Brands Expands Major Brand with Launch of Gummies in Washington State

Nevis Brands CEO John Kueber joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce the exciting expansion of the Major brand from beverages to gummies. Major Gummies will be offered in 100mg packages, containing ten 10mg gummies per package. Notably, these gummies are the only ones in the Washington market to utilize SoRSE emulsion, the same innovative ingredient used in Major beverages, which allows for improved taste and rapid onset. The flavors of Major Gummies will be consistent with the beverage line and will initially be available in Orange Mango and Blue Raspberry.

Kueber explained that Nevis' licensee for Major in Washington State has completed its initial round of production, with initial sales set to begin in the first week of June. This timely launch positions Major Gummies to make a significant impact on Q3 financial results. According to the Imarc Group, a research firm, the cannabis edibles market is estimated to be approximately $3.4 billion, indicating substantial market potential for Major Gummies.

The introduction of gummies represents a strategic expansion for the Major brand, leveraging the success and consumer trust built through its beverage line. The use of SoRSE emulsion ensures that the gummies will deliver a consistent, high-quality experience with a rapid onset, a key differentiator in the competitive cannabis edibles market.

Kueber emphasized that the new product aligns with Nevis Brands' commitment to innovation and quality. By maintaining the flavor profiles and effective delivery system that customers expect from Major beverages, the company aims to capture a significant share of the growing edibles market. The initial focus on Orange Mango and Blue Raspberry flavors highlights the brand's strategy to offer familiar and popular tastes to its consumers.

Looking ahead, Nevis Brands plans to expand the distribution of Major Gummies beyond Washington State, exploring opportunities in other markets to further enhance its footprint in the cannabis industry. The successful launch and anticipated positive reception of Major Gummies could pave the way for additional product lines and continued growth.
