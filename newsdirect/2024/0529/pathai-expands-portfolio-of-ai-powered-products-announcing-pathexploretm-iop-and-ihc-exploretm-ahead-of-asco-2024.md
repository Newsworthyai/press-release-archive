# PathAI Expands Portfolio of AI-Powered Products, Announcing PathExplore™ IOP and IHC Explore™ Ahead of ASCO 2024

PathAI, a global leader in AI-powered pathology, unveiled two novel AI products, PathExplore™ Immuno-Oncology Profiling (IOP) and IHC Explore1™ to empower cancer drug developers and clinical researchers with AI-powered insights. The product pairing provides unprecedented single-cell and spatial resolution of the tumor microenvironment from routine pathology samples to facilitate biomarker discovery and deeper understanding of treatment response for the next generation of cancer therapeutics. The expansion of the Explore™ portfolio comes at a time when AI-pathology is experiencing accelerated large-scale adoption across the diagnostic and biopharma industries.

“As cancer rates continue to rise, the demand for advanced precision medicine tools that provide accurate biological insights has never been greater. Our mission to make a difference in patient lives is unwavering, and these new products showcase our commitment to providing researchers with the tools they need to make meaningful advancements in cancer research, treatment and care,” said Andy Beck, PathAI CEO. “We're thrilled to introduce these two groundbreaking products ahead of the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting.”

PathExplore IOP: H&E-Based Immune Phenotyping

The composition of the tumor immune microenvironment plays a crucial role in characterizing tumors likely to respond to immunotherapy. PathExplore IOP expedites characterization of immune phenotypes by quantifying tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and their spatial distribution using routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) samples. With this new product, researchers have the ability to quantify TIL spatial arrangements within tumor core and periphery, and gain insights around the sample’s immune inflamed, desert, or excluded characteristics.

PathExplore IOP was designed specifically to quantify patterns of immune infiltration characteristic of a strong immune response, and ultimately improved patient survival. Immune infiltration has been previously shown to be prognostic of positive outcomes, however; standardized and scalable approaches for investigating these phenotypes remained elusive.

“PathExplore IOP illustrates the power of AI by visually interrogating the dynamics between cancer cells and immune cells with unparalleled resolution for highly accurate and efficient immune phenotype classification,” said Benjamin Glass, VP of Product & Translational Research. “Researchers can now access insights at scale to better inform biomarker strategies for patient stratification and mechanisms of response and resistance.”

PathExplore IOP will be featured in a poster presentation at the upcoming ASCO 2024 meeting, demonstrating the product’s application for stratification of patient response to checkpoint inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer.

IHC Explore™: AI-Powered Biomarker Quantification

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a widely utilized approach for identifying biomarkers unique to certain cancers, informing treatment strategies, measuring prognosis, and patient classification for clinical trials. IHC scoring in the early clinical settings can be time-consuming, subjective, and low-resolution. Especially in early stage biomarker development, defining an optimal scoring system for a novel IHC assay can be complex. IHC Explore™ fills a need for spatial quantification of IHC biomarkers in single-cell resolution with broad target compatibility.

IHC Explore provides a panel of standardized and structured features that quantify IHC stain abundance within and around cells of the tumor microenvironment, enabling drug developers to build biomarker scoring strategies from scratch for most IHC stains – and to precisely find those patients most responsive to treatment. PathAI’s partnership with Roche streamlines the translation of these AI insights and scoring strategies into companion diagnostic development.

“Drawing on our advanced computational pathology expertise, we're extending the impact of our Explore product suite, which enables us to seamlessly support AI-powered assay development,” said Hisani Madison, VP of Precision Medicine and Medical Device Development. “This advancement is poised to revolutionize biomarker-based drug development for new immunotherapies, antibody drug conjugates, and paving the way for the analysis of the next generation of targeted cancer therapies.”
