# PureFacts Financial Solutions Selects BridgeFT’s WealthTech API to 
Enhance Data Infrastructure for End-to-End Revenue Platform

PureFacts Financial Solutions, a leader in revenue management, fees calculation, incentive compensation and insights for the asset and wealth management sector, announced today it has selected BridgeFT’s WealthTech API to aggregate total wealth data to power and enhance PureFacts’s award-winning software for end-to-end revenue management.

Through this partnership, PureFacts will leverage BridgeFT’s WealthTech API data infrastructure platform to:

* Secure efficient, direct access to normalized, accurate multi-custodial client and investment account data.
* Leverage that data to onboard and upgrade clients faster and more easily.
* Enrich data for enhanced AI and analytics

BridgeFT capabilities will further support PureFacts in connection with its new partnership with BNY|Mellon’s PershingX, which recently announced that it has selected PureFacts to provide billing, fee reporting, advanced revenue management, incentive compensation and sales performance for its new wealth management platform, Wove.

“We are committed to helping wealth management firms grow and succeed,” said PureFacts Chief Executive Officer Robert Madej. “As a global WealthTech company, we rely on clean, high-quality data to drive accelerated growth in new markets. Our partnership with BridgeFT will allow us to better service our clients while also streamlining and capturing data on their behalf more effectively.”

BridgeFT is a cloud-native, API-first wealth infrastructure software company that enables financial institutions, fintech innovators and registered investment advisors (RIAs) to deliver better, data-driven outcomes for their clients. Its WealthTech API is the industry’s first WealthTech-as-a-Service platform, offering a single, open API to AI and analytics-ready, multi-custodial data aggregation, advanced analytics, and application services. WealthTech API removes the need for individual data feeds from a range of custodians and back-office providers, allowing wealth management firms and technology companies to create differentiated, next-generation wealth management applications.

“PureFacts continues to break new ground for wealth and asset managers by fundamentally rethinking the complete revenue management lifecycle in order to increase revenue certainty and improve operational efficiencies through their best-in-class technology,” said Joe Stensland, Chief Executive Officer of BridgeFT. “We are thrilled to partner with the PureFacts team to enable streamlined access to critical client and investment account data that is foundational to integrating and automating the revenue process across the enterprise. Together, PureFacts and BridgeFT offer a unique combination of capabilities and expertise to help financial institutions and their teams achieve better business outcomes.”
