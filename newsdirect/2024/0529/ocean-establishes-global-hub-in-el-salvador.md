# OCEAN establishes global hub in El Salvador

San Salvador, SV, May 29, 2024 – OCEAN [link], the Bitcoin mining pool backed by Jack Dorsey and spearheaded by longtime Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr, announced today that it has formed an entity in El Salvador, which will function as the company’s international hub of business development. OCEAN MINING S.A. de C.V will be headquartered in the capital city of San Salvador, and plans to use this hub to continue the advancement of decentralization of Bitcoin mining across the globe.

OCEAN’s co-founder and CTO Luke Dashjr, who earlier this year spoke to university students at the San Salvador CUBO+ program, commented: “El Salvador is on the leading edge of Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining adoption, and we believe OCEAN’s presence here will help to advance these efforts here and create new opportunities for El Salvador and elsewhere.”

OCEAN’s President Mark Artymko added, “To further our decentralization efforts we needed a global presence, and El Salvador was the obvious choice. With places like Venezuela and the EU imposing legislation to ban Bitcoin mining, El Salvador’s political stance was in stark contrast and a beacon of hope for the industry.”

El Salvador has earned itself the esteemed title of “Bitcoin Country'' as a result of its decision to not only make Bitcoin legal tender in 2021 but also in remaining steadfast in their commitment to Bitcoin only. It is, in fact, in large part because of the Bitcoin Country brand that OCEAN, the only mining pool focused exclusively on Bitcoin, is interested in establishing a presence in the country so as to differentiate themselves from other more crypto focused mining pools.

Stacy Herbert of El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office welcomed the news by OCEAN, saying, “This decision by the OCEAN Mining team reaffirms that the Bitcoin-first culture we are building in El Salvador is providing the tools that entrepreneurs around the world need to thrive in a Bitcoin economy. We welcome OCEAN and all other companies working to advance Bitcoin adoption.”

Speaking to OCEAN’s upcoming plans for decentralization, Bitcoin Mechanic, Global Head of Sales at OCEAN, said, “Stratum V2 is just the start. For us it goes much deeper and is about shifting the balance of power away from a handful of pools and bringing miners of all sizes closer to the nucleus of Bitcoin. Bringing these features to market from our new global hub in El Salvador will ensure maximum reach and adoption in a safe regulatory environment.”

OCEAN Mining said that it is looking forward to providing resources to continue the education and development of Bitcoin communities in El Salvador, including places like El Zonte, commonly known as “Bitcoin Beach”, which have prospered thanks to their organic circular economies.
