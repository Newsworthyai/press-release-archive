It finally happened. Bitcoin (BTC) has reached the prophesied $100k landmark and then some, sending the whole crypto community into a frenzy. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s ETF has also cleared a new milestone, amassing 500,380 BTC, holding roughly half of the total BTC across all US-based ETFs.

Cutoshi, a newcomer, continues to make waves in the meme coin space, as investors are funneling the market-wide euphoria into the incredibly successful presale of the $CUTO token.

Bitcoin Celebrates $100K, What’s Next?Although this move has been already teased for weeks, once a $100k BTC became reality, it cemented the legitimacy of Bitcoin in the eyes of even the most outspoken skeptics. At the time of writing, Bitcoin sells for $101k with a 7.2% intraday decrease as selling pressure intensified just below the $104k mark. The massive influx of liquidity resulted in a 131% spike in volume, with over $138 billion worth of BTC traded on exchanges.

Although the dust from the rocket still hasn’t settled, some experts have already stepped in with new predictions. For starters, prominent trader and analyst CrediBull Crypto has been vindicated, as his Bitcoin projection during the most bearish months of the, played out almost exactly as portrayed on the chart. The next targets for Bitcoin are eyeing the $110k level, although a cool-off phase is likely to take place first.

Institutional investors continue to bid heavily on Bitcoin. The largest spot BTC ETF, BlackRock’s IBIT, is now holding over $50 billion worth of Bitcoin or roughly 2.3% of the 21 million BTC in existence. In the first few days of December, Bitcoin ETFs have recorded a massive $1.5 billion in inflows, highlighting exponential interest in the asset.

However, not everyone is happy, as over the last 24 hours a staggering $137 million in short positions were liquidated.

Many investors who took profits are now taking advantage of the discounted prices of low-cap alts that could yield much greater gains. One such glaring example is Cutoshi as it's just starting to gain traction.

Cutoshi Raises The Bar For Meme CoinsCutoshi draws inspiration from the Lucky Cats present in Japanese tradition. These cats are believed to bring good fortune to businesses and households. Meanwhile, Cutoshi aims to bring good fortune to the blockchain and its rapidly growing community through the revolutionary Cutoshi Farming system.

Cutoshi unites memes and DeFi into a unique MemeFi ecosystem that empowers and rewards users.

Cutoshi incentivizes users to engage with the ecosystem via the Cutoshi Farming mechanism.

On top of this, during and after the presale, individuals can participate in special events and complete various tasks in exchange for points that can be later redeemed for CUTO tokens post-presale.

One of Cutoshi’s most interesting features is the Cutoshi Academy. This is a learning platform that will help newcomers navigate the DeFi space and learn the ins and outs of trading and portfolio management. This initiative will also help spread the word about Cutoshi, organically growing the user base.
