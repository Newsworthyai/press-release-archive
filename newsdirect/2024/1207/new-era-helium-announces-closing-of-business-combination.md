The combined company will operate under the new name, “New Era Helium, Inc.”

The trading of the Company’s shares on Nasdaq represents a pivotal milestone in New Era Helium’s mission to establish itself as a leading consolidator of helium and natural gas production. With over 137,000 acres in Southeast New Mexico and 1.5 billion cubic feet of proved and probable helium reserves, NEH is well-positioned to drive growth in this critical sector, expected to see a surge in demand amid growth in data centers powering artificial intelligence.

Last month [read here], NEH announced a non-binding joint venture with Sharon AI, Inc. (“Sharon AI”) to build a 90MW net-zero Tier 3 data center to be located within the Permian Basin. This joint venture combines Sharon AI’s expertise in high-performance computing with NEH’s extensive helium and natural gas reserves. The state-of-the-art facility will feature a liquid-cooled Tier 3 data center powered by sustainable energy, offsetting approximately 250,000 metric tons of CO2 annually through carbon capture technology.
