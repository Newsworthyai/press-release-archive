The E-File engine inside Real Business Solutions W2 Mate 2024 meets the 1099 electronic filing requirements of the Internal Revenue Service and many state departments of revenue by proving the ability to generate files in the IRS 1099 electronic filing format for IRS FIRE system and CSV format for IRIS portal. The W2 1099 software by Real Business Solutions (RealTaxTools.com) also fully supports the EFW2 format for e-filing W2's with the Social Security Administration and states that accept EFW2 submissions. W2 Mate is one of the very the first 1099 software products to introduce the ability to generate secure PDF 1099s and W2s.
