# Silexion Therapeutics Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results and Provides Business Update

Silexion Therapeutics Corp. (NASDAQ: SLXN) ("Silexion" or the "Company"), a clinical-stage biotech developing RNA interference (RNAi) therapies for KRAS-driven cancers, today reported its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided an update on recent business developments.

Recent Milestones & Q3 Business Highlights

Merger Completion: On August 15, 2024, Silexion completed its business combination with Moringa Acquisition Corp, becoming a publicly traded company on Nasdaq under the ticker “SLXN.” This strategic milestone provides Silexion with greater access to capital to advance its clinical pipeline.

Clinical Program Progress: The Company's first-generation candidate, LODER™, has previously demonstrated promise in clinical settings for non-resectable pancreatic cancer. As previously reported on September 24, 2024, the Phase 2 trial of LODER showed a 56% objective response rate (ORR) in patients with KRAS G12D/V mutations, with tumor resectability improving to 67% for some non-resectable cases. The trial data underscore LODER’s potential to improve surgical outcomes and overall survival for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC).

Preclinical Advancements for SIL-204: Silexion's next-generation candidate, SIL-204, designed to expand the therapeutic reach across a wider range of KRAS mutations, demonstrated substantial anti-tumor effects and enhanced stability in preclinical studies. As previously reported on October 1, 2024, a single administration of SIL-204 encapsulated in an extended-release formulation yielded tumor necrosis in pancreatic cancer models.

Advancing toward SIL-204 Clinical Trials: As previously reported on October 1, 2024, Silexion is preparing SIL-204 for toxicology studies, with plans to initiate Phase 2/3 clinical trials by the first half of 2026, targeting LAPC.

Exploring Colorectal Cancer Applications: In parallel, the Company plans to initiate preclinical studies for SIL-204 in colorectal cancer models, expanding its potential applications across additional KRAS-driven cancers, as previously reported on October 1, 2024.

Ilan Hadar, Chairman and CEO of Silexion, commented, “The last few months and Q3 specifically has been pivotal for Silexion as we achieved notable progress across our clinical and preclinical programs and successfully completed our Nasdaq listing. LODER’s promising data reinforce our pipeline’s potential as a transformative solution for patients with challenging pancreatic cancer. As we prepare for Phase 2/3 trials in SIL-204, our recently reported pre-clinical findings underscore the potential to address the complexities of KRAS-driven cancers. Looking ahead, we remain focused on expanding our clinical pipeline to deliver groundbreaking treatments for these hard-to-treat cancers, with the goal of having a real impact on patient lives.”

Third Quarter 2024 Financial Result Highlights:

Cash Position: Cash and cash equivalents were $2.0 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $4.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease primarily reflects operating expenses and strategic investments in advancing clinical and preclinical development as well as one-time payments associated with the SPAC merger and our public listing on NASDAQ.

Operating Expenses: Total operating expenses for the Q3 2024 were $8.0 million, compared to $0.7 million in the same period of 2023. This increase was primarily driven by investments in the advancement of the company's clinical pipeline, including $3.2 million in research and development expenses (compared to $0.5 million in Q3 2023). The R&D increase was primarily attributable to $2.4 million in non-cash share-based compensation expenses. General and administrative expenses increased to $4.8 million (compared to $0.2 million in Q3 2023), with $3.4 million attributable to non-cash share-based compensation and $0.6 million in professional services costs primarily related to one-time legal, accounting, and other expenses associated with the costs of becoming a public company and the SPAC merger.

Financial Expenses: Financial expenses, net for Q3 2024 were $3.8 million, compared to $0.1 million in Q3 2023. This increase was primarily driven by a one-time loss of $4.8 million upon entering Transactions, partially offset by $1.1 million in revaluation income from changes in fair value of financial liabilities.

Net Loss: Net loss for the third quarter was $11.9 million, up from $0.8 million in the same period of 2023. The increase was mainly due to higher research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, and financial expenses, including significant non-cash items related to share-based compensation, transaction costs and costs related to becoming a public company.

Funding Updates: During Q3, Silexion drew down on its Equity Line of Credit (ELOC) agreement raising approximately $0.6 million in net proceeds to support its development and growth. Through the date of this report, including the Q3 transactions, the Company has raised total net proceeds of $2.5 million
