![](https://public.newsdirect.com/165051259/DB0ZqIW5.jpg)

Spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted a record-breaking inflow of close to $1.4B on Thursday, according to Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust collected more than $1.1B of this total. Other funds, including the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, also attracted a noticeable daily inflow exceeding $8M. The surge coincided with BTC hitting the $76,943 mark.

Tron also recorded an unprecedented surge in its transfer volume, which increased by 1928% over the year, as per data from Symbiosis. Moreover, as the two crypto giants continue to record impressive milestones, a new DeFi hybrid known as Cutoshi has also stood out, raising over 730K in its presale, which is only in 3rd stage.

Cutoshi Farming Continues To Attract Major InvestorsDue to its unique innovations, Cutoshi is quickly becoming a viral crypto project. The project is designed to bring utility and luck to its investors through its unique hybrid DeFi ecosystem. Moreover, Cutoshi farming, now live, aims to provide its community members with a new way of earning money by completing quests and being rewarded with CUTO tokens.

Cutoshi also stands out due to its decentralized exchange, offering users a low-fee, high-speed asset training experience across blockchains. The project also focuses on educating investors through the Cutoshi Academy, which helps learners understand the basics of DeFi and cryptocurrency technology. Through this feature, new investors could educate themselves about DeFi and discover new approaches to building a profitable portfolio.

With a stage three presale price of $0.0259, Cutoshi is already offering over 70% ROI to early buyers. Given the CUTO token's capped supply of just 440M, this price is also set to surge in the next presale, which could help drive immense demand for the token, leading to token scarcity and driving the Cutoshi price even higher.

Bitcoin Price Hits $77K Two Days After U.S. ElectionThe price of Bitcoin crossed the $77K mark on November 8, setting a new ATH for the second consecutive day. This latest price mark was set just two days after Donald Trump won the US presidential election, topped with the election of several pro-crypto policymakers to Congress. With a market cap of over $1.5T, BTC is now the world’s ninth most valuable asset, surpassing Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta.

Bitcoin’s YTD growth has also surged by over 115% as the BTC price trades around the $76,600 mark. Over the past month, the price of Bitcoin has surged by over 26%, with seasonal trends and halving-year data suggesting bullish prospects. Moreover, Bitcoin has always hit new highs during the previous two election cycles without returning to pre-election levels.

Supported by technical indicators and the recent daily inflows of Bitcoin ETFs, the price of BTC could hit the $100K target before the year ends, followed by $200K by 2025. Adding to this momentum, the US Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates by 0.25%, a rare cut that could contribute to Bitcoin’s bullish sentiment.

Tron Dao Unveils Tron-Peg USD Coin For Cross-Chain Transactions On BlockchainTron Dao has unveiled the Tron-Peg USD Coin within the TRX blockchain, a new cross-chain designed to streamline global transactions while expanding Tron’s stablecoin ecosystem. This launch will allow users to leverage USD Coin across the TRX network, enhancing cross-chain functionality for a seamless and secure transaction.

Tron-Peg USD Coin will simplify USDC transfers within Ethereum and Tron, establishing itself as a stablecoin bridge. Moreover, qualified users can acquire the Tron-Peg USD Coin through a straightforward cross-chain process. This strategic launch comes when Tron’s price performance has recorded a weekly dip of over 3% to trade around the $0.16 mark.

If Tron’s price manages to overcome the $0.16 position, it would be on a path for further gains towards $0.17. Its RSI is also at 47, which suggests that the asset is still in a neutral position. Its 50—and 100-day SMAs, which are at $0.1593 and $0.1526, provide significant support should the TRX price dip.

Can Cutoshi Mirror BTC Price Performance In Q4?As Bitcoin continues to experience significant price performance, Cutoshi is also looking to push Ethereum-based meme coins back into the limelight. Due to the project's DeFi ecosystem and built-in utilities, its growing presale is set to record significant price performance in Q4.
