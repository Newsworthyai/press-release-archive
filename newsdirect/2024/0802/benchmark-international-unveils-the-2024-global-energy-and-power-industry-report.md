Benchmark International is proud to announce the release of its highly anticipated 2024 Global Energy and Power Industry Report. This comprehensive report provides crucial insights into the evolving landscape of the global energy sector.

With electricity demand forecasted to grow at an average of 3.4% annually through 2026 and a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.84% from 2024 to 2028, the report highlights the significant factors driving this growth. Key contributors include increasing energy needs in emerging markets, global electrification, and the rising demand for green hydrogen.

The report underscores the global shift towards renewable energy, noting that the share of renewables in the global power mix is expected to more than double over the next two decades. Despite the push for reduced fossil fuel consumption, the demand for oil, gas, and coal is predicted to reach record levels this year, driven by specific regional needs and market dynamics.

Key highlights from the report include:

* Solar Energy: Projected to lead U.S. electricity generation growth in 2024, with a 36-gigawatt increase in solar generating capacity.
* Energy Storage: Set to experience significant growth, with current projects potentially increasing battery manufacturing capacity by nearly eight times.
* Wind Energy: Slower growth compared to solar due to higher costs and supply chain challenges, though China continues to dominate the market.
* Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A): Anticipated consolidation in the oil and gas sector, along with active M&A activity in the renewable energy space driven by valuation imbalances and increasing digitization demands.

Benchmark International's report provides valuable insights for stakeholders across the energy sector, from government agencies to private companies and investors. As the industry navigates through a critical phase of transition, this report serves as a vital resource for strategic planning and investment decision-making.
