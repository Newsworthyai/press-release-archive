# Apple Rush Company, Inc.  Announces Acquisition of Trucking Company to Fuel Growth. Acquisition expected to increase top line revenues by over 10 million dollars in 2025

Stotland Trucking, LLC is a last mile hauler based in Texas with a pipeline for growth over the next 24 months. Stotland specializes in short haul logistics and is adding additional business monthly. Current revenues are more than $7 million.

CEO of APRU, Tony Torgerud, states, “I am excited to execute on our plans of being a fully vertically integrated holding company. We have been implementing our roll up strategy over the last year and have seen good success in our top line revenues. Our brewing, co-packing, and extraction businesses are setup to do over $10 million in revenue in 2025 and with this acquisition will push us north of $20 million dollars. Our profitability in 2025 will be strong with margins as high as 200% on our websites and 50% in co-packing. We will be producing multiple lines of functional beverages along with our current craft beer production.” He goes on to say, “We know freight is the largest expense we have within the beverage industry and being able to utilize our own delivery system will save us and our customers money. Derik Stotland came to us with a plan to help his growth and give us the important parts of logistics with software, insurance, and industry knowledge without us having to create it on our own.”

Derik Stotland, president of Stotland Trucking, commented “We have been executing on our business plan and were looking for a partner to grow with. We decided based on the options available to us that Tony and the Apple Rush Company would give us both upside on being a partner and an additional hub to grow our system from. Illinois is a great place to expand to from Texas and a terminal there will give us additional opportunities for exponential growth. Our plan is to acquire additional contracts for hauling, adding the trucking assets needed as we grow, and building out a regional system creating higher efficiencies in deliveries.”
