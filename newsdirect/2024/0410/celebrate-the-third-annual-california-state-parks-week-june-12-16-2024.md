Launched in 2022, California State Parks Week advances the “Outdoor Access for All” initiative championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom, and the Natural Resources Agency’s “Outdoors for All” initiative. These initiatives expand outdoor access to all Californians through focused investments in open space infrastructure, outdoor programming, and improvements to permit applications, with a priority to support underserved communities.

Why California State Parks Week?

California’s state parks preserve and protect the state’s natural and cultural history. In recent years, it has become abundantly clear that public lands play a critical role in making communities stronger, happier, and healthier. Our shared parks are places where everyone can connect with nature and find inspiration and joy. California State Parks Week is a fun way to celebrate the wonder and sense of community that the outdoors provide to Californians and visitors from all over the world.

* Armando Quintero, director of California State Parks: “The third annual State Parks Week celebrates the diverse natural and cultural heritage preserved within California's 280 state parks. This week also reminds Californians that ‘This is where you live.’ All Californians deserve to enjoy these public outdoor spaces. There are many ways to explore them including with free park passes for select state parks. Welcome – Bienvenidos – 欢迎 – Maligayang pagdating.”

This week presents a special opportunity for both residents and visitors to California to fully immerse themselves in the beauty and significance of the state's protected spaces, including its state parks. By engaging with these natural and cultural treasures, individuals have the chance to develop a deeper connection to the land and its history. It's a time to embrace the wonder of these protected spaces and to reflect on the role each of us plays in their conservation and stewardship.”
* Sam Hodder, president and CEO of Save the Redwoods League: “Research consistently demonstrates the numerous health benefits associated with spending time outdoors and experiencing nature. California's state parks serve as invaluable access points to these experiences for people of all backgrounds and ages. By providing opportunities for outdoor recreation, connection with nature, and encounters with awe-inspiring landscapes and cultural treasures, California's state parks play a vital role in promoting overall health and fostering a deeper appreciation for the natural world and human history.”

California State Parks protect the best of the state’s natural and cultural history; more than 340 miles of coastline; the tallest, largest and among the oldest trees in the world; and deserts, lakes, rivers and beaches. There are more than 5,200 miles of trails, and 15,000 campsites, prehistoric and historic archeological sites, ghost towns, historic homes and monuments—all waiting to be explored.
