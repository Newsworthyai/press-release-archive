CuFe Ltd (ASX:CUF) executive director Mark Hancock sits down with Proactive’s Jonathan Jackson to share insights about the promising outcomes of a comprehensive soil geochemical program and the strategic Heritage Protection Agreement ahead of drilling at the North Dam Project. Hancock discusses the geochemical results, which have not only broadened the scope of lithium oxide anomalies but also sharpened the focus for the initial drilling stage. This development signifies a leap forward in CuFe's exploration efforts, bolstering the company's prospects in identifying viable lithium resources. The partnership with Marlinyu Ghoorlie Native Title Claimant Group through a Heritage Protection Agreement was highlighted as a pivotal step, ensuring exploration activities proceed respectfully and beneficially for both parties. This collaboration underscores the importance of local support and the mutual advantages of sustainable and responsible resource development. With heritage surveys pending, CuFe anticipates starting its drilling operations this quarter, aiming to unveil the potential of a significant lithium system in the Spargoville and North Dam region. Hancock points out the active exploration by various junior and major companies in the area, which underscores the region's mineral potential. Hancock also talks through the company’s copper and iron ore projects and the news expected to flow from those.
