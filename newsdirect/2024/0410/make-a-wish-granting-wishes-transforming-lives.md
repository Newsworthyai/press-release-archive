Make-A-Wish stands as a beacon of light for children battling critical illnesses. Through their unwavering dedication, this remarkable organization has been transforming lives, one wish at a time.

Make-A-Wish is more than just wish fulfillment; it’s an important part of the medical journey that can lead to improved medical outcomes.

All of this work wouldn’t be possible without the support of countless “WishMakers” stepping up throughout the process. That’s why Make-A-Wish – with the help of celebrity supporters – is announcing a bold initiative aimed at recruiting 1 million “WishMakers” worldwide.

On March 28th, a nationwide media tour was conducted featuring Leslie Motter, president and CEO, Make-A-Wish America, and Chris Campbell, a Make-A-Wish alum (i.e., former wish recipient) who had a wish granted to meet the New York Giants in 2001 while undergoing treatment for a brain tumor. Chris’ wish inspired him to pursue a career as a registered nurse and complete the 2023 New York City Marathon to raise money to grant more wishes. They were joined in interviews by WWE Superstar, Cody Rhodes.

Topics they discussed during the media tour included:

· How Make-A-Wish was started, and the stories of previous wishes granted.

· The launch of “WishMakers Wanted.”

· Hearing from Make-A-Wish alum Chris about the impact of his wish being granted and how it inspired him to go into the medical field and complete the New York City Marathon.

· Why Cody Rhodes choose to grant wishes and be involved with Make-A-Wish.

· How people can get involved throughout World Wish Month (April) and on World Wish Day (April 29).
