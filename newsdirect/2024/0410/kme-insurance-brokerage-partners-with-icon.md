--News Direct--

ICON, a joint venture between AIMCOR Group, LLC (“AIMCOR”) and AmeriLife Group, LLC (“AmeriLife”), announced today that it has entered into a partnership with KME Insurance Brokerage, a leading, national brokerage firm that specializes in corporate and individual disability and life insurance. Per the agreement, terms of the deal were not disclosed.

“I’m excited to partner with Steve Heney and his team and look forward to a bright future for KME as part of ICON,” said Marc Verbos, president of ICON. “This partnership further highlights our vision and dedication to create a platform that combines expertise, resources and innovation to offer value to our affiliates. KME's knowledge of the disability market strengthens our overall capabilities and enables our affiliates to broaden the range of services they offer their agents, allowing them to have a greater impact on the lives of their clients."

Founded in 2007 and headquartered in Chicago, KME was built to serve and grow the businesses of employee benefit firms and independent producers to assist their clients with disability and life insurance protection. With more than 100 years of combined industry experience, KME’s in-house experts provide comprehensive support, including point-of-sale assistance, benefits implementation, case manager coordination, underwriting assistance and post-issue client administration. The team’s hands-on approach and deep product knowledge have helped the firm earn a strong reputation for excellence in service, which has been a major engine for its growth and persistency.

“The KME Team is excited to partner with ICON,” said Heney, principal of KME. “This collaboration will allow us to expand our footprint and further educate producers on the importance of income protection and life insurance. This partnership will not only enhance our services, but also provide our producers with even more valuable resources and support.”

As part of ICON, KME will gain access to new life insurance and annuity products, among other leading resources, and become a part of a rapidly expanding AmeriLife Wealth Group, which aims to deliver best-in-class services to the modern agent and financial professional to ensure their clients – no matter their stage of life – never outgrow them.

“Continuing to add to ICON’s strong, diverse roster of partners is a crucial piece of AmeriLife Wealth Group’s long-term strategy to transform wealth distribution,” added Mike Vietri, Chief Distribution Officer of AmeriLife Wealth Group. “I’m thrilled to welcome Steve to our growing platform and look forward to watching his business grow and thrive under Marc’s leadership.”
