Unfortunately, an increase in early-onset pancreatic cancer has garnered significant media attention lately. From 2010-2019, gastrointestinal cancer rates jumped almost 15% for people under 50, alarming doctors around the globe. With only a 12% five-year survival rate, pancreatic cancer is anticipated to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. by 2030. It is projected that 64,440 Americans will receive a pancreatic cancer diagnosis in 2024.

In 2022, the global market for pancreatic cancer was valued at $2.22 billion, and it is projected to reach approximately $7.91 billion by 2032. This highlights a crucial need for more therapeutic options for pancreatic cancer. Oncotelic Therapeutics (OTCQB: OTLC), a therapeutics company with a focus on cancer and viral infection treatments, is attempting to provide more hope for Americans who are facing a pancreatic cancer diagnosis.

The company’s lead immuno-oncology drug candidate is OT-101. Oncotelic Therapeutics says it is showing promise in the treatment of deadly cancers like pancreatic cancer. It is a first-in-class anti-TGF-β RNA therapeutic that inhibits a protein called Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-β). TGF-β is known to suppress the immune system, help cancer cells evade the immune system and increase the growth and spread of cancer cells.

Clinical Trial For OT-101Phase 2 studies of OT-101 have shown promising results in treating pancreatic cancer, melanoma and glioblastoma, with strong efficacy and safety outcomes among treated patients. Pancreatic cancer is one of the most highly aggressive types of cancer that can be difficult to treat and has a high unmet need.

Oncotelic Therapeutics is now seeking participants for its upcoming STOP-PC clinical trial. The trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the TGF-β2 Targeting Antisense Oligonucleotide OT-101 in combination with mFOLFIRINOX compared to mFOLFIRINOX alone in patients with advanced and unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

Previous data has shown that OT-101 has significant activity as a standalone treatment, with reported overall survival rates surpassing existing drug outcomes. In this phase 2/3 trial, participants will be assigned to either receive OT-101 plus mFOLFIRINOX or mFOLFIRINOX alone as second-line therapy after their cancer has progressed.

"STOP-PC trial is the combination of mFOLFIRINOX and OT-101 based on our demonstration that reduced TGF- β2 resulted in outstanding improvement in survival among patients treated with Irinotecan with survival beyond 34 months for the low TGF-β2 expression cohort. The mFOLFIRINOX was chosen as the most well tolerated combination of choice through discussion with regulatory authorities and key opinion leaders. We believe this trial will deliver the decisive win against pancreatic cancer," said Dr. Vuong Trieu, CEO of Oncotelic.
