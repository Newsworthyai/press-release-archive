# American Rare Earths shares assay results expanding Rare Earths at Halleck Creek in Wyoming

--News Direct--

American Rare Earths Limited CEO Donald Swartz joined Steve Darling from Proactive to share significant news regarding assay results from a recent mapping and sampling program conducted in the Cowboy State Mine area. These results provide valuable insights that will enable the company to target higher-grade areas contiguous to the mining area identified in the recently published scoping study. Swartz emphasized that these findings complement the updated JORC resource estimate of 2.34 billion tonnes and demonstrate consistently enriched mineralization at Halleck Creek.

Swartz explained that the mapping and sampling campaign focused on achieving a higher resolution of data. A total of 95 samples were sent for analysis at ALS Global, including 5 quality assurance/quality control samples of standards, blanks, and duplicates. Surface samples revealed concentrations of up to 6,221 ppm total rare earth oxides (TREO), indicating the potential for a larger, higher-grade rare earth element (REE) resource area within the Cowboy State mine area. Notably, the mine planning in the recent scoping study averaged 3,805 ppm TREO.

Additionally, the samples showed significant concentrations of magnetic rare earths, averaging 27% of TREO. This data will be instrumental in supporting future drilling efforts aimed at delineating higher-grade resources.

Swartz expressed confidence in the company's prospects, highlighting the importance of these assay results in guiding future exploration and development activities. The findings underscore American Rare Earths' commitment to advancing its projects and unlocking the full potential of its rare earth element deposits in the Cowboy State Mine area.
