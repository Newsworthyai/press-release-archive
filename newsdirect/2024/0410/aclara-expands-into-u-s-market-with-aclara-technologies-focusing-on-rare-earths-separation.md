# Aclara Expands into U.S. Market with Aclara Technologies, Focusing on Rare Earths Separation

--News Direct--

Aclara Resources Chief Executive Officer Ramon Barua joined Steve Darling from Proactive to share exciting news about the company's strategic expansion into the United States market. Aclara has incorporated a U.S.-based subsidiary, Aclara Technologies, with the aim of developing its rare earths separation capabilities in the country. This strategic move comes following Aclara's joint venture with CAP to develop metal and alloys capabilities, positioning the company to become the first vertically integrated heavy rare earths company outside of Asia.

Barua explained that this move was made possible by Aclara's unique feed of clean heavy rare earths, particularly Dysprosium and Terbium, which are expected to be sourced from two stable and investment-friendly countries in the Americas. The decision to integrate vertically addresses the need for creating a geopolitically independent supply chain for permanent magnets, which are crucial for the performance of electric vehicles, wind turbines, robotics, and other applications associated with the decarbonization of the planet.

Aclara Technologies will source high-purity mixed rare earths carbonates from Aclara's extraction modules in Chile and Brazil. These carbonates will then be converted into individual rare earths oxides in the separation facility. To support this process, Aclara Technologies has awarded a contract to the Saskatchewan Research Council to develop a production flowsheet specifically designed for its premium carbonate.

This strategic expansion into the United States market underscores Aclara's commitment to establishing a robust and sustainable supply chain for rare earth metals and alloys, further solidifying its position as a key player in the global rare earths industry.
