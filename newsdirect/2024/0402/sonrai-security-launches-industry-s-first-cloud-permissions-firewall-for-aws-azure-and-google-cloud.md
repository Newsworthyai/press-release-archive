# Sonrai Security Launches Industry's First Cloud Permissions Firewall for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud

--News Direct--

Sonrai Security, a leader in cloud security solutions, today unveiled the launch of the industry's first Cloud Permissions Firewall for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. This groundbreaking technology revolutionizes cloud access and permissions security, offering a seamless one-click least privilege solution with zero disruption for cloud operations and development teams.

Sonrai's Cloud Permissions Firewall transforms the complex landscape of cloud access and permissions security into a streamlined process with just one click. By leveraging sensitive access and permissions intelligence, the Sonrai Cloud Permissions Firewall identifies and determines the necessary access or rights required for running workloads in the cloud. It then instantaneously blocks unnecessary and risky access to cloud services and permissions across the entire cloud estate. Development is uninhibited with automated exceptions for needed access and a frictionless permission-on-demand workflow that supports permission expansion as needed.

Between AWS, Azure and GCP, there are over 42,000 possible permissions, with new permissions added daily. Thousands of permissions can be leveraged to do damage – including exposing data, nefarious entry, privilege escalation and lateral movement. As companies scale their clouds, unused sensitive access and privileges balloon, leaving gaping security holes. The Sonrai Cloud Permissions Firewall closes these holes instantly.

“We have worked with companies and developers tasked with 1000’s of extra things to fix in their code, and it’s not working to solve this pressing security problem or privilege and access bloat,” said Brendan Hannigan, CEO and co-founder of Sonrai Security. “We knew there was a better option than just another ‘visibility tool’ – The Cloud Permissions Firewall delivers action that automatically closes these security vulnerabilities with zero-disruption to ongoing operations.”

The Cloud Permissions Firewall delivers:

* 92% reduction in the cloud permissions attack surface
* 97% time saved accomplishing least privilege
* 100% protection of new identities

“The challenge about deleting unused identities or enforcing least privilege is we know it's the ‘right’ thing to do, but everyone’s afraid it’ll break something or interrupt our development cycles,” said Preetam Sirur, Chief Information Security Officer of Eye Care Leaders. “However, the assurance the Cloud Permissions Firewall brings us has eliminated our hesitations. Now we just deploy – confidently.”

The Cloud Permissions Firewall will be generally available on April 15th for AWS. Azure and GCP will soon follow.
