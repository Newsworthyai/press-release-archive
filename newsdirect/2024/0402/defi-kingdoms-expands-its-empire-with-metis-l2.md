Today, DeFi Kingdoms’ (DFK) crown token $JEWEL launched for trading on the Metis Layer 2 network and its leading DEX, Hercules.

DFK emerged on the Web3 gaming scene in 2021, when people were still learning about Web3 gaming. It’s so far garnered industry-wide attention, massive user adoption, and booming transaction volumes, earning its place among the top Web3 games and one of the most fun to play.

The gaming protocol recently partnered with Metis to launch its upcoming Player vs Player Arena (PvP), known as The Colosseum, exclusively on the Metis Layer 2 network – the only L2 sharing operational control and revenue with its community via a Decentralized Sequencer.

The launch of DFK token $JEWEL on Hercules boosts the already booming growth trajectory of Metis’ leading DEX.

Hercules launched less than a month ago and has already amassed significant TVL, earning its place among the top dApps on Metis as the first Sustainable DeFi Liquidity Platform built for LPs. The launch of the $JEWEL/$METIS pool is the latest opportunity offered during Hercules’ Genesis Pools period, which closes on April 7.

Those looking to get into Web3 gaming are encouraged to check out DeFi Kingdoms and swap into $JEWEL on Hercules DEX. Users holding $JEWEL will earn extra rewards for joining the liquidity pool, with emissions in $TORCH, xTORCH, and xMETIS.

The partnership of DFK and Hercules will leverage the Metis ecosystem’s recent growth and decentralization push, creating an avenue for long-time DFK users and $JEWEL holders to onboard to Metis, and seamlessly trade $JEWEL with deep liquidity on the ecosystem’s newest and already largest DEX: Hercules.

“The partnership with Metis will allow us to accelerate some timelines,” wrote DeFi Kingdoms in its recent community update. “PvP will now be brought to our players sooner and with more features than originally anticipated! Additionally, having PvP content opens opportunities for more competitive gameplay, tournaments, streaming content, additional use of in-game items such as potions, and more demand for higher-level and stronger Heroes.”

Fans and players of DFK will enjoy the lower fees, faster transaction speeds, and Metis rewards distributed to further incentivize gameplay and tournaments.
