# Korean Beauty Brand MIXIK SKIN Launches With Industry First, All-Mist Skincare Line

--News Direct--

MIXIK SKIN, a Korean beauty brand based in Los Angeles, launched today on a mission to break down the barriers of skincare, making it accessible for all, irrespective of age, gender, or skin type. Teaming up with first retail partner Thirteen Lune, MIXIK SKIN’s innovative all-mist skincare line introduces a minimalist yet effective skincare collection designed to simplify routines while delivering exceptional results.

Founder Sunny Oh created MIXIK SKIN out of an essential need for a convenient, sanitary, and travel-friendly skincare solution that was fun yet effective. Inspired by Korean beauty practices, Oh joined forces with co-founders Christine Moon and Lena Park, who recognized the transformative potential of mists in skincare, especially for those with active lifestyles, and embarked on a mission to integrate the ease of mists into every facet of skincare rituals.

"Society often dictates rigid standards of beauty and skincare, but we believe that everyone deserves access to products that enhance their natural beauty without limitations," said Sunny Oh, CEO and Co-Founder of MIXIK SKIN. "With MIXIK SKIN, we're not just offering sanitary skincare; we're offering empowerment – the freedom to embrace your unique skin journey confidently, conveniently, and consistently."

MIKIK SKIN blends the best of both worlds with roots in Los Angeles and production and innovation from Korea. At MIXIK, crafting skincare solutions from luxury-quality ingredients at an affordable rate is imperative to its ethos as the brand aims to cultivate a diverse and inclusive beauty landscape, ensuring that everyone’s skincare needs are addressed at every price point.

"As a Korean-American, I've always felt a deep connection to both cultures, and MIXIK SKIN is a reflection of that fusion," said Christine Moon, Managing Director and Co-Founder of MIXIK SKIN. "We're proud to bring the essence of Korean beauty to a global audience, while also championing diversity in an industry that often lacks representation."

MIXIK SKIN's debut collection features four essential products: the Cleansing Oil, Jelly Toner, Botanical Serum, and Hydra Cream, all formulated with the rejuvenating properties of blue agave and rosewater. Crafted with a commitment to ethical practices, all MIXIK SKIN products are cruelty-free and vegan, embodying the brand's core values of inclusivity, simplicity, and quality.

"We believe that skincare should be both effective and enjoyable, which is why we've curated a line that prioritizes simplicity without compromising on results," said Lena Park, Brand Director and Co-Founder of MIXIK SKIN. "Our products are designed to fit seamlessly into any routine, providing nourishment and hydration for every skin type."

MIXIK SKIN is available to shop at www.mixikskin.com and at Thirteen Lune. For more information and updates, visit www.mixikskin.com and follow @mixikskin on social media. Hi-res images, interviews, and media samples are available upon request.
