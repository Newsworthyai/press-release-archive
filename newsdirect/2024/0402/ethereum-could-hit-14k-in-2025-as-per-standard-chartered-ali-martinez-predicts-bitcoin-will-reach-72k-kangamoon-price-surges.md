An Ethereum Price Prediction by Standard CharteredRecently, Ethereum (ETH) has been on the rise. As per CoinMarketCap data, the Ethereum price surged from $2,947 to $3,467 over the last 30 days. In that time, its market cap also rose from $354B to $416B. According to Standard Chartered, the Ethereum ETF approval may push its value to $8,000 in 2024 and $14,000 in 2025.

In the next two years, Ethereum is expected to perform at or surpass Bitcoin. The Ethereum crypto also trades above its 100—and 200-day EMAs while boasting 25 green technical indicators. Thus, experts foresee ETH hitting $4,500 within Q2 of 2024.

Ali Martinez with a Bullish Bitcoin Price PredictionBitcoin (BTC) is another crypto that has been soaring recently. In fact, the Bitcoin price rose from $51,100 to $67,250 in the last month. During that period, its market cap increased from $1T to $1.31T. Analyst Ali Martinez predicts that Bitcoin may reach $72,880 soon.

The technical analysis of the Bitcoin crypto also paints a bullish picture. For instance, BTC is now trading above its 100 and 200-day EMAs while having 26 technical indicators showing buy signals. For all these reasons, market analysts forecast Bitcoin to reach a value of $84,000 within Q3 of 2024.

KangaMoon (KANG): On Pace To Hit $1While Ethereum and Bitcoin dominate headlines, meme coins like KangaMoon (KANG) are also making waves. This rising presale star has already obtained over $3.4M and is projected to reach $4M before April ends.

KangaMoon is preparing to release a play-to-earn (P2E) game that uses its native token, KANG. With KANG, players can buy in-game items and boost their characters’ abilities. This immediately sets KANG apart from 99% of meme coins, which have no utility. Because of this, KangaMoon could emerge as one of the best new meme tokens.

What makes KangaMoon different is how they build community. Before its official launch, KangaMoon gives active members of its community free KANG coins through engagement on various social media platforms. In other words, if you share, like or comment on KangaMoon’s social media posts, you may win free KANG before its launch.

Currently, in Stage 4 of its presale, KANG has a value of $0.014 - up 180% from its starting price of $0.005. According to experts, this meme coin could be worth around $1 in Q2 of 2024 as a Tier-1 CEX listing is coming..They also base this prediction on KangaMoon’s ties to the P2E games market which Yahoo Finance projects will reach $885M by 2028.

Will KangaMoon Pump Faster Than Ethereum and Bitcoin?Currently, KangaMoon has a market cap of $14M. With such a low market cap, KANG has a good chance of faster and more notable growth than Ethereum and Bitcoin. Because of this, KANG could become the next member of the meme coin titans.
