# Stanton Chase Expands to Burgeoning Huntsville, Alabama Through Its New Office

--News Direct--

Stanton Chase proudly announces the inauguration of its newest office in Huntsville, Alabama. Two of the company’s leading executives are spearheading the initiative. Al Smith, Jr., is the youngest managing partner in Stanton Chase’s history and is collaborating with seasoned advisor Daniel Casteel. Casteel is also a managing partner and the Stanton Chase Global Functional Leader for CEO Search and Succession, bringing nearly 25 years of industry experience to the new office.

The Huntsville office gives Stanton Chase a “boots on the ground” presence in Alabama’s fastest-growing market. Nicknamed “The Rocket City,” Huntsville’s population has surged in recent years and has been named the number one best job market in the U.S. Already the largest city in the state and an affordable place to live, the area also has a reputation as an aerospace, defense, and technology hub. Bioscience and advanced manufacturing also have a strong presence, and the city’s population growth is driving commercial, residential, and industrial construction.

The strategic location of the new Stanton Chase office places it in close proximity to esteemed organizations such as Dynetics, ADTRAN, SAIC, and Toyota Manufacturing. These industry leaders align seamlessly with Stanton Chase's expertise in executive recruitment and leadership advisory, facilitating tailored partnerships with organizations poised for success. As the inaugural Stanton Chase presence in north Alabama, the Huntsville office serves as a pivotal hub, catering to the needs of forward-thinking businesses and fostering impactful collaborations statewide.

“I am honored to be part of Huntsville's dynamic growth and flourishing business community," stated Al Smith, Jr. "Amidst its palpable energy and burgeoning enterprises, Huntsville stands poised to emerge as a leading business hub in the Southeast. I look forward to collaborating with local organizations, leveraging our expertise in executive search and leadership advisory to drive strategic growth and foster impactful leadership development initiatives across the region.”

Daniel Casteel echoed this sentiment, saying, “I have been in this industry for years, and it is clear that Huntsville has significant potential for growth.” The managing partner added, “At Stanton Chase, integrity, transparency, and discipline are at the core of every client and candidate relationship we build. These are the standards that we intend to bring to the Huntsville office. By immersing ourselves in our clients’ cultures, operations, and leadership dynamics, we gain valuable insights into their vision and needs, which enables us to forge enduring partnerships that will last.”

Both Smith and Casteel eagerly anticipate the challenges and opportunities ahead as they collaborate to establish the new Huntsville office as a pivotal asset within the broader Stanton Chase global community.
