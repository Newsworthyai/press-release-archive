Grant Haywood, CEO of Horizon Minerals Ltd (ASX:HRZ), sits down with Proactiveâ€™s Jonathan Jackson to share his insights into the company's strategic blueprint for gold production near Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. The plan encompasses four key phases: developing the Cannon and Pennys Find underground mines, advancing the Kalpini open pit and conducting short-term development and feasibility studies at the Boorara project.In the current climate of record gold prices, Horizon aims to capitalise on this opportunity by advancing its large resource endowment towards development, thereby generating cash flow. Haywood emphasizes the company's methodical approach to negotiations and approvals, ensuring a steady progression of development assets towards sustainable gold production.The impending merger with Greenstone Resources is set to enhance Horizon's portfolio, introducing new, high-grade, near-term mining opportunities in the Coolgardie region.
