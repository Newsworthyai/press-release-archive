--News Direct--

Coniagas Battery Metals CEO Frank Basa joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce the company's strategic acquisition of key ground near SOQUEM’s Cardinal Property, located 80 km southeast of Chibougamau, Quebec. This acquisition underscores Coniagas’ commitment to capitalizing on high-grade copper-nickel-cobalt-platinum group element deposits in the region.

Basa explained to Proactive that Coniagas has staked a total of 28.3 square kilometers of ground in multiple packages, with the new package containing 531 claims covering 28,397 hectares. This newly acquired property package, named Dartagnan, is strategically located with highway access to the southern part and a network of logging roads providing access to other areas. Additionally, Dartagnan South benefits from a power corridor leading to Chibougamau.

By strategically staking ground adjacent to SOQUEM’s Cardinal Property, Coniagas has capitalized on local prospectors’ expertise and regional geological data, including magnetic features and lake sediment samples with anomalous base metals. This proactive approach underscores Coniagas’ dedication to identifying and securing promising exploration targets with the potential for significant mineralization.

The acquisition of the Dartagnan property represents a significant milestone for Coniagas Battery Metals as it expands its footprint in a highly prospective mining region. With access to key infrastructure and leveraging geological data, the company is well-positioned to advance exploration efforts and unlock the potential of the Dartagnan property.

In summary, Coniagas Battery Metals' strategic acquisition underscores its commitment to exploration and development in the Chibougamau region. The Dartagnan property presents exciting opportunities for the company to identify and develop high-grade copper-nickel-cobalt-platinum group element deposits, further enhancing its position in the battery metals sector.
