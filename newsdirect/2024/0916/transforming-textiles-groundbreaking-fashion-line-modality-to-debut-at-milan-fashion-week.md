# Transforming Textiles' Groundbreaking Fashion Line ‘Modality’ to Debut at Milan Fashion Week

Sweden / ThriveNewsWire / September 16, 2024 / Transforming Textiles AB fashion brand Modality, under the creative direction of Sara Rosberg, is set to make a significant impact on the runways of Milan Fashion Week. The groundbreaking collection themed 'Endangered Animals’ and named “Fading Fables” combines innovative Sense-Tex fabric technology, focusing on environmental conservation and sustainable fashion.

The collection will be unveiled on September 20th, at Museo Della Scienza in Milan, hosted by Friend of the Earth and the World Sustainability Organization. The runway show, titled “Beyond the Claim,” will showcase certified fashion brands and materials by Friend of the Earth, including Sense-tex. Sense-Tex is an innovative biobased 5-fiber yarn technology that combines style, functionality, and sustainability.

The Sense-Tex technology, which can be described as a “canvas”, enables sensors (external or embedded) to be applied and integrated onto or inside the fabric to measure vitals. Sense-Tex as a fabric offers health-enhancing benefits and strong ethical values, standing on its own as a sustainable textile without requiring technological integration. Due to pressing upcoming EU regulations affecting the industry, the organizers removed all added sensor tech for this show to focus on the Artistry and Sense-Tex as sustainable fabric.

The sensor customization incurs higher costs per unit and requires research and development for each specific sensor project. Therefore, the company is seeking tech partnerships and collaborations with companies that are interested in tailoring their product with sensors to fit their specific needs and budgets.

Sense-Tex is a certified material by Friend of the Earth that aligns with the upcoming new EU regulations for the Textile Industry, which requires 10% biobased material in all collections. The multifunctional Sense-Tex yarn and fabric developed by Transforming Textiles (www.Sense-tex.com) has also received a “Seal of Excellence” from the Materials Connexion lab in NYC, where it became part of their exclusive materials library (addressing both the public and private sectors globally).

The Sense-Tex yarn/fabric serves various verticals by scaling up the company (Transforming Textiles AB) with subsidiary divisions and a holding structure for the approved IP, as they aim to raise capital to scale up.

The Transforming Textiles pitch deck can be reviewed here.

This Fading Fables collection by Modality showcases the material's versatility and demonstrates how it can be used in various fashion styles, moods, and genres. Modality is presenting handmade pieces made by Sara Rosberg herself, using scrap fabrics and upcycled garments, combined with prints on Sense-Tex, seamlessly merging art, fashion, and sustainable textile solutions.

“The Fading Fables collection is more than just a fashion collection,” says Sara Rosberg. “It tells a story, raises awareness, and highlights the inseparable connection between the future of fashion and the future of our planet. By utilizing upcycled materials and incorporating biobased technologies like Sense-Tex, we not only meet the new EU regulations but also set a new standard for the industry, helping them to transition into the new regulatory landscape.”

The theme of the show centres on displacement and the plight of endangered animals, poignantly speaking to the loss of home and the need to flee. As models walk the runway, a powerful video will play in the background, depicting the destruction of animal habitats, the urgent need for conservation, and why we need to support Friend of the Earth and the World Sustainability Organisation. The video was created by Ayesha Saboor, Sara Rosberg, and Charlotte Kehler. The collection will also feature endangered animal-inspired accessories by Charlotte Kehler, made from waste and scrap fabric, with designed artwork printed on Sense-Tex fabric.

Modality has partnered with Elobina.com and the Head of Operations, Vilma Gustafsson as a sustainable solution for designers. This collaboration allows Modality to create its own designs and utilize print-on-demand services. By focusing on smaller quantities and producing only what is necessary, this approach fosters a more sustainable production model.

Sara Rosberg emphasizes, “Sustainability is not just a trend, it is a necessity. This collection is more than just fashion; it is a call to action, urging the industry and consumers to embrace a more responsible relationship with our environment."

For Buyers

We offer the fashion garments showcased on the runway for pre-order sales to boutiques, retailers, and others through our look-book and website www.Modality.store. Please note that due to the complexity of producing Sense-Tex, the estimated delivery time is 5-6 months, but can vary. As some garments have been upcycled by hand, there may be small variations in the sourcing of identical fabrics for larger orders. We want to ensure that the buyers and retailers are aware of this extended timeline, as it differs from traditional textile materials and standard production.

We have planned to coordinate bringing smaller orders together with the larger volume orders in one production batch in the coming weeks after MFW. Should we be unable to deliver the combined small quantities due to not reaching the MOQ of 1000kg, Modality will notify you beforehand.

Sense-Tex is produced in 3 different factories to ensure the highest quality and performance for safety. A Yarn factory (Kipas), a fabric manufacturer (Ozen Mensucat), and a garment producer (Fethi Tekstil). Due to the brand being in a start-up phase without external funding, there are no fibers in stock, which will delay the production process in this first batch.

In the future, when Modality has secured funding, lead times of Sense-Tex will be a maximum of 3 months, when Modality branches out with external funding as a subsidiary of Transforming Textiles AB.

Modality also offers options to purchase only the yarn or the fabric in the desired quality, with Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) requirements (1000kg= 40-60 rolls of fabric approx.) for volume production. These prices include Modality receiving a percentage of the future data revenue if sensors are applied and sold together with Sense-Tex. If there is a preference to order Sense-Tex without this clause when using sensors/tech, we add 20% on top of the current prices stated. However, there are ethical requirements attached from Modality and Transforming Textiles AB in the purchase order agreement to protect the end-user and ensure the handling of data is GDPR compliant and ethical use of the product. If you only wish to buy the fabric and not attach sensors/tech, the prices are as below.

For independent designers, we aim to trade Sense-Tex through fabric retailers shortly, enabling purchases of small quantities for slow fashion production.

Sense-Tex fabrics and yarns are available in three different compositions: Qty A, Qty B, and Qty C. Each composition caters to different production and manufacturing needs in the Fashion industry, accommodating different focuses and margins.

Fabric Prices (Approximately)

QTY A: 32EUR/M

QTY B: 24 EUR/M

QTY C: 21 EUR/M

Yarn Prices (Approximately)

QTY A: 78EUR/KG

QTY B: 57EUR/KG

QTY C: 47/EUR/KG

**Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) requirements 1000kg.
