# Babson College Enhances the Student Experience with AI-Powered Tools and Grants for AI Experimentation

As a new academic year begins, Babson College is empowering its students with new AI-driven tools and opportunities. The College has introduced the MathBot, developed jointly with Microsoft and Terawe, to support student learning across various academic backgrounds. Additionally, Babson has committed $250,000 in AI-focused student grants to provide additional financial support to explore innovative AI solutions. All students will also have access to Microsoft Copilot, further enhancing their educational experience.

Babson empowers students to harness AI technology's potential and pair it with an entrepreneurial mindset, enabling them to act as purposeful, innovative entrepreneurial leaders who transform ideas into reality and make a lasting impact on their careers and the world. Flagship courses including Foundations of Management and Entrepreneurship and Foundations of Business Analytics prepare students to immediately impact business decision-making regardless of industry. However, under a national concern for math literacy and the course’s heavy reliance on probability and statistics, Babson faculty recognized an academic gap that AI could help solve.

Babson partnered with Terawe and Microsoft’s Azure Services to create the MathBot, an innovative solution and a significant leap forward in educational technology. The MathBot pairs academic material with generative AI capabilities to streamline the learning process, meet the unique needs of each individual student through customized learning pace and style, and provide opportunities for future learning by offering additional online resources.

“Babson College is dedicated to fostering student success by actively identifying and addressing the obstacles they face,” said Patty Patria, CIO of Babson College. “Our educators are constantly sourcing state-of-the-art tools and innovative solutions to accelerate learning and ensure student success. The rise of AI provided a perfect opportunity to bring individualized learning to students and better equip the next generation of entrepreneurs and business leaders.”

Babson has also dedicated a total of $250,000 in grants to be awarded to students for AI implementation in educational or entrepreneurial endeavors. Up to 250 students will be granted $1,000 each, after application and approval, to meet these needs. In addition, all students will be granted access to various Generative AI models that will help build innovative solutions for real-world problems.

“Babson College has a long history of embracing new and innovative approaches to the entrepreneurial process that has positioned us as the flagship institution for entrepreneurship education,” said President Stephen Spinelli Jr. MBA’92, PhD. “Our community’s embrace of generative AI provides the next generation of entrepreneurial leaders with important access to crucial resources and emerging technologies. These valuable initiatives, which represent a portion of Babson’s greater strategy related to AI, will position us well to remain a global leader operating at the intersection of entrepreneurship and technological innovation in academia.”
