# Moneytree Software Unveils Innovative Financial Planning Solution to Revolutionize Client-Advisor Relationships

Moneytree Software has launched a new, game-changing financial planning solution that empowers advisors to capitalize on changing investor expectations and grow their business.

Recent research has shown that today’s clients care as much about their relationship with their advisors as they do about their portfolio performance. They value trust and understanding, and they want more consistent and personalized engagement.

This is where the new Moneytree solution excels, according to Moneytree Software Managing Director Patrick Spencer.

“Long-term success depends on all of us in this industry rethinking how we interact with clients and prospects,” Spencer said. “With this new solution, you have the tools you need to both cultivate more client relationships and develop deeper ones.”

Moneytree developed the new cloud-based solution with a focus on the company’s foundational values of accuracy, comprehensiveness, and transparency. Furthermore, the modern interface and intuitive user experience enables advisors to plan with precision in a way that is more satisfying, more time-effective, and more scalable.

“With the new Moneytree, you can focus less time on understanding and navigating your planning software and more time on building relationships that grow your business,” Spencer said.

Features include:

* Both goal-based and cash-flow based planning modules to meet the needs of every client, regardless of where they are in their financial journey.
* Interactive, client-centric reporting tools that help turn insights into action.
* A wealth of specialized planning tools that save advisors time and money and help them cultivate deeper, more authoritative relationships by supporting retirement planning, income distribution, tax planning, and estate planning.
* The industry’s only transparent audit trail, which allows you to show highly engaged clients how you arrived at your answers.
* Advanced analytics that encourage client collaboration and drive better decision-making.

In developing the solution, Moneytree spent countless hours on surveys, phone calls, emails, and pouring over market research. Product developers listened to what advisors like about various solutions, and equally importantly, what they found cumbersome.

Already, Moneytree’s new solution is receiving rave reviews.

“This is one of the best financial planning softwares I have seen, and I have been doing this since 1999,” said Greg Gilbert, CEO of Infinity Financial Services.

The new Moneytree is currently available in the comprehensive “Elite” planning package, which replaces the previous Moneytree Plan software. Moneytree is continuing to support Plan, but will no longer sell it.

A more streamlined, goals-based-only planning package called “Essential” will become available in early 2025. That product will replace what is currently Moneytree Advise.
