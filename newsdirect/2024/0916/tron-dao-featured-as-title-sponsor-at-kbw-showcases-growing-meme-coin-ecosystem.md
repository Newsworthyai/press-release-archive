Geneva, Switzerland - September 16, 2024 - TRON DAO took center stage as a Title Sponsor at Korea Blockchain Week (KBW), an annual global blockchain and Web3 festival in Seoul, South Korea. Dave Uhryniak, Community Spokesperson at the TRON DAO, delivered a compelling keynote on the fast-growing meme coin ecosystem within the TRON network, highlighting its evolution and unique position in the crypto space. KBW 2024 featured a wide range of discussions, including the integration of AI with blockchain and the resurgence of DeFi through real-world asset tokenization.

Korea Blockchain Week (KBW) is a global event celebrating blockchain and Web3 innovation. Organized by FACTBLOCK since 2018, the event brings together industry leaders, cutting-edge technologies, and a range of activities designed to foster communication and collaboration within the blockchain ecosystem. As one of the most significant blockchain events in South Korea, KBW continues to make a substantial impact across the East Asia region, driving forward innovation and dialogue in the space.

In his keynote speech, Uhryniak highlighted the explosive growth of the meme coin market, which is approaching a total valuation of $40 billion. He emphasized that as the market continues to expand, institutional investors are likely to increase their involvement, recognizing the significant opportunities and potential within the space. Uhryniak compared meme coins to a modern form of digital art, highlighting their accessibility for anyone to create. He stated, "Meme coins are a piece of a reaction to culture and they're often very much a statement on culture at a specific time or on a specific event. They give everyone the opportunity to become an artist. They're the perfect Web3 application. They democratize making social commentary and making art".

Uhryniak also emphasized the critical need to build a truly decentralized network that empowers creators and developers. With the recent push to expand the meme coin ecosystem, TRON is providing users everywhere the ability to unleash their creativity and connect with communities. At its core, the TRON ecosystem is designed to equip creators and developers with the tools and freedom they need to turn their ideas into innovative projects.

TRON DAO is pushing forward with its goal to decentralize the internet, creating new and innovative blockchain solutions while building strong connections with communities around the world. Being part of Korea Blockchain Week shows TRON DAO’s dedication to shaping the future of decentralized technology and continuing to educate and inspire people in the blockchain space.

About TRON DAO

TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.

Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of September 2024, it has over 256 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 8 billion total transactions, and over $20 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN.

In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government’s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (“DMC”), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica’s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.
