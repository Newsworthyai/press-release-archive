Historian Amanda Podany says that "many of the details of modern life...have origins that go back for thousands of years." One of the most significant is the important role water plays in our lives, especially for cleaning. One company is augmenting water's cleaning power with the most important element of life.

Cleaning With Cutting-Edge Nanobubble TechnologyThe cleaning power of ozone is well established. The odorless, colorless gas made up of three oxygen molecules has been scientifically proven to be a safe and effective way to purify water in some applications and to preserve the quality and freshness of fruits and vegetables, and one company is applying this science in a number of new ways.

CleanCore Solutions (AMEX: ZONE) has developed a patented technology to infuse water with ozone gas to create what it says is the cleaning industry’s most effective all-natural and chemical-free cleaner. Referred to as Aqueous Ozone, CleanCore’s highly concentrated solution of dissolved ozone is delivered in the form of nanobubbles.

Smaller than a 1/1000th of a grain of sand, these nanobubbles deliver a powerful oxidizer remarkably effective at killing bacteria and other forms of germs, reports the company. CleanCore’s process is completely natural, so it is simpler, healthier and more sustainable than other disinfectants.

CleanCore’s environmentally friendly solution eliminates the need for harsh chemicals in most cleaning processes. The company’s patented technology effectively turns water and oxygen into a detergent.

CleanCore says the ozone nanobubbles its products create can completely cover the pitch and contour of any area to which they are applied. This means that CleanCore offers an effective way to clean and sanitize flat surfaces like countertops and floors, as well as objects like tools, instruments and equipment.

Using CleanCore’s products can eliminate the bacterial odors that often remain after traditional cleaning and that chemical disinfectants try to mask with added fragrance. The only residue of Aqueous Ozone is pure, clean oxygen.

Cleaning Up Around The WorldCleanCore is building a global business by delivering products that are easy to use. Their systems effectively dissolve ozone into regular tap water to create a powerful disinfectant that attacks and destroys contaminants.

Applicable in settings as diverse as restaurants, offices, single-family homes, healthcare facilities, schools, sports and entertainment arenas, government offices and other buildings, the benefits of CleanCore’s Aqueous Ozone have wide application.

Eliminating harsh chemicals makes CleanCore’s products healthier for people to use. They have little environmental impact and give consumers cost-efficient cleaning solutions that the company says are sustainable and more effective than traditional cleaning options.

This seems to have aided CleanCore in recently launching a successful pilot program with one of the nation’s largest logistics companies and two major hotel groups. The company also reports that it is rolling out an additional pilot program with the largest commercial property manager in the country and a leading building services company.

CleanCore’s global customer segments include hospitality and food service, household cleaning (including laundry), commercial cleaning and health care, and the company shares that its technology is used at more than 20 international airports as well as in universities and hospitals around the world.

Key Industries Driving CleanCore’s GrowthAn important market segment for CleanCore is janitorial sanitization. This part of the company’s business extends its reach to many Fortune 500 companies.

CleanCore’s success selling to these large companies may be the result of what public relations firm, Purpose Brand LLC, says is the Fortune 500’s desire to weave sustainability “into the fabric of business operations." Many of those operations depend on providing a clean working environment.

CleanCore serves these companies with its PowerCaddy and MiniCaddy product line, high-pressure spray and vacuum systems that deliver on-demand surface cleaning. The Caddy line has demonstrated an improvement of 65% to 97% over conventional chemicals and helps users reduce the cost of storing, ordering, handling and distributing cleaning products, reports CleanCore.

In addition to surface cleaning equipment, CleanCore also manufactures ice-making solutions proven to continually purify the water used to make ice. The systems are used by hotels, restaurants and other facilities where potable ice is made.

CleanCore also provides laundry solutions to both industry and individual consumers. The company’s commercial laundry offering focuses on hospitals, hotels and other laundry facilities. CleanCore notes that its laundry units can reduce dry time up to 60% by eliminating chemical residue that traditional methods leave behind.

Third-party assessments of CleanCore’s Aqueous Ozone technology have shown its effectiveness at eliminating a number of pathogens including Legionnaires’ disease. It has also been proven to eliminate protein residue from surfaces.

Adding to the potential appeal of CleanCore’s products is that they are significantly less expensive than traditional chemical cleaners. Because the base ingredients are natural, CleanCore says its technology won’t subject customers to the type of price hikes that inorganic compounds can. CleanCore says its systems pose no health risks to a company’s employees, customers or guests – adding to its appeal.

An Up And Comer In A Huge Industry?The demand for green, or eco-friendly, cleaning products that are safe and effective is on the rise. The global cleaning services market is projected to reach some $630 billion by 2030. According to Fortune Business Insights, that represents a 168% increase over where it was just a couple years ago.

The future of the cleaning equipment and supplies industry seems bright. Still, CleanCore is a relatively small player in the market. Recent government regulations could change that.

The Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration recently took steps to ban perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS) in the United States. These substances, commonly referred to as forever chemicals, are present in many cleaning products.

The health risks of PFAS are well-known, and the annual cost to the healthcare system to treat them is estimated to be as high as $59 billion in the U.S. This could provide a catalyst to drive demand for CleanCore’s solutions and potentially be a catalyst for its growth – making this a company worth watching for interested investors.
