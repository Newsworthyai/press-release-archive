BELLAMI, the #1 hair extension brand, globally, takes its partnership with renowned Brand Ambassador Eric Vaughn to the next level with the highly anticipated re-launch of the BELLAMI x Eric Vaughn Collection, which debuts today after its unveiling at BELLAMI’s Las Vegas Showcase.

“BELLAMI has always been a brand I can trust. Not only does the BELLAMI name mean hair of unparalleled quality, but the brand has always believed in my vision and helped bring it to life,” says Vaughn. “Together, we’ve created a collection with rich dimensionality so that we, as stylists, have more versatility behind the chair. This collection is meant to make our lives easier, while giving us the inspiration and tools to create a more refined, elegant vibe full of depth for our clients.”

BELLAMI x Eric Vaughn features ten pre-blended, multi-tone shades, each with up to four warm, neutral and cool tones. The ready-to-use collection reduces prep-time and increases styling efficiency and is available across Flex Weft, Tape-In, and K-Tip methods for a customizable approach. Its diverse and complex shade range enables stylists to impart high style with natural movement, seamlessly.

Vaughn’s deep-rooted history with BELLAMI resulted in his first collection with the brand in 2022, which is now part of the best-selling shades within the BELLAMI portfolio. With new additional and reimagined classics including Smoked Ice, Caramel Sticky Buns, Cinnamon Twist and Cookie Dough, the BELLAMI portfolio is even richer in ‘flavor’.

“Supporting our hair stylist community is essential in everything we do,” says Mary Burns. “They inspire us to challenge ourselves. With Eric as our long-term brand ambassador, we are excited to bring these highly complex blends to market and continue to grow the BELLAMI brand through innovation.”
