# SPARK Microsystems to Demonstrate Bit-Perfect Wireless Audio Delivery at AES Show 2024 NY

SPARK Microsystems, a Canadian fabless semiconductor company specializing in next-generation short-range wireless communications, will showcase an industry-first breakthrough in wireless audio delivery at AES Show 2024 NY (October 8 -10, Jacob Javits Convention Center, New York).

At the event, SPARK will share the results of an exhaustive third-party expert analysis comparing SPARK ultra-wideband (UWB) digital audio performance versus the performance delivered with a digital wire. On Thursday, October 10, 11AM in Demo Room 3D04, audio industry expert Jeff Anderson will present an audio transmission data comparison of UWB and straight S/PDIF wire links at data rates up to 24 bits and 96Ks/s.

In a major breakthrough for the audio industry and a giant leap beyond legacy Bluetooth wireless, the results will show that SPARK UWB audio delivery is indistinguishable from a wired transmission, exhibiting bit-perfect fidelity. Data shows that the SPARK UWB transmission scheme delivers a pristine, uncorrupted audio bit depth at ultra-low latency. Headsets, speakers and audio equipment harnessing this bit-perfect performance profile can deliver wired-like sound quality – without the wires.

AES Show 2024 NY attendees are invited to experience SPARK’s breakthrough wireless audio quality for themselves via demonstrations of SPARK’s headset demo kit. Delivering pristine uncompressed 96kHz 24-bit audio quality, the SPARK UWB audio technology featured in the headset design ensures that listeners can enjoy their music and entertainment with flawless sound fidelity.

SPARK’s headset demo kit offers support for up to 96kHz stereo audio and a 48kHz 16-bit microphone back channel with an impressive low latency of sub-7ms, making the technology ideal for applications where clear, uninterrupted communication is essential. SPARK audio technology far outperforms legacy Bluetooth in data throughput, low latency and power efficiency, while enabling lower latency and significantly lower power consumption than Wi-Fi-based audio technologies to ensure longer battery life.

“SPARK’s reputation for audio excellence has been embraced by prestigious audio brands from Focal to Sonus Faber,” said Fares Mubarak, Chief Executive Officer, SPARK Microsystems. “Expert analysis now affirms what these brands and their discerning customers already know – SPARK’s wireless audio delivery performance is unrivaled. I’m looking forward to meeting with attendees, customers and stakeholders at AES Show 2024 NY to discuss the future of wireless audio delivery.”

AES Show 2024 NY attendees are invited to visit SPARK Microsystems at Booth 542 for live demonstrations of SPARK’s headset demo kit. Audio industry expert Jeff Anderson will present his research and findings on Thursday, October 10, 11AM, in Demo Room 3D04.
