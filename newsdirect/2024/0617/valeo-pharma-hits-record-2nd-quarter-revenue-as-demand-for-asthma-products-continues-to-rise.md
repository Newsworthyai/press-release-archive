# Valeo Pharma hits record 2nd quarter revenue as demand for Asthma products continues to rise

Valeo Pharma CEO Steve Saviuk joined Steve Darling from Proactive to discuss the company's financial results for the second quarter, which saw record-breaking revenue for the period. The company reported revenues of $14.1 million for Q2, an increase from the $13.6 million recorded in the same quarter of 2023. This represents a growth of 4%. The revenue increase was primarily driven by a boost in sales due to promotional activities in the respiratory segment, Allerject, and sustained growth from other core products such as Redesca and Simbrinza.

However, Saviuk emphasized that these top-line numbers do not fully capture the extent of the company's progress. Despite the overall growth, the company faced revenue softness in several of its non-core brands and encountered short-term structural delays in Ontario that impacted Redesca. These challenges somewhat masked the robust performance of Valeo's asthma franchise, which saw a 52% increase in Q2 revenues compared to the same quarter the previous year. Specifically, total prescriptions for Enerzair and Atectura for the 12 months ending April 30, 2024, surpassed 88,000, marking a significant 96% increase over the 12-month period ending April 30, 2023.

In addition to discussing revenue figures, Saviuk announced that Valeo Pharma is undertaking a comprehensive restructuring of its commercial field operations. This initiative aims to improve profit margins, reduce operating expenses, align the company's commercial infrastructure with current market dynamics, and accelerate its journey towards profitability. These cost reduction measures are expected to decrease operating expenses by more than $5 million annually. Combined with previously implemented cost-saving strategies, Valeo anticipates that total cost savings will exceed $7 million.
