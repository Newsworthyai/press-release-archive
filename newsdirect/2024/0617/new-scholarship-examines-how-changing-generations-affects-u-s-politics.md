# New Scholarship Examines How Changing Generations Affects U.S. Politics

As we approach another presidential election, attention will return to polls and how we can expect voting to vary by generation. Already New York Times articles in 2024 have featured the headlines “Young Voters Have an Entirely Different Concept of Politics” and “Prospect of a Rematch of Biden-Trump Causes Young Voters to Retreat.” Our pop culture often assumes that different generations have different political leanings and beliefs—that the Silent Generation is all Republican, white, and conservative, or that Millennials are liberal and diverse—but are these assumptions true? The University of Michigan Press is publishing a book that explores this very question: Generational Politics in the United States: From the Silents to Gen Z and Beyond edited by Sally Friedman & David Schultz.

"What's in a generation? How do we know when a new one begins, while an old one ends? Going beyond public opinion to also explore how generations manifest themselves within elite behavior, this book is bound to be a cornerstone in the study of generational politics and political socialization, shaping the discourse for years to come."

— Elias Dinas, European University Institute

This is the first comprehensive book that examines the concept of generations from a political science perspective. It brings together chapters from an array of political science scholars that will give readers insight into the role of generations in American politics, how generations relate to other variables such as age, race, gender, and socioeconomic status, how politics in the United States are impacted by changes in generations, and how the passing of the Baby Boom generation and rise of the Millennials and Gen Z will change American politics.

This book is part of the University of Michigan Press's "Dialogues in Democracy" collection, which invites all readers to find books that contextualize their experiences of voting in America. To make sure all interested readers have an opportunity to engage with this scholarship, the book will be published open access and will be immediately available free-to-read online.
