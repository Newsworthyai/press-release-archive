Enhancing Client Experience

PriceOn will empower ATFX to manage trading flows more effectively and efficiently, ensuring clients benefit from superior execution and competitive pricing. The advanced technology underpinning PriceOn, which leverages artificial intelligence and sophisticated algorithms, is designed to handle complex client flows seamlessly. This capability will enable institutional clients flows to match with a broad range of retail client flows, (and vice-versa) even those with challenging characteristics, without compromising execution performance.

Advanced Technology and Client-Centric Approach

PriceOn’s AI-based algorithms represent the cutting edge of trading technology, providing precise and strategic execution that maximizes profitability for clients. Unlike traditional models, this partnership focuses on delivering enhanced returns for ATFX’s global clients.

Building an Integrated Trading Ecosystem

By integrating PriceOn, ATFX is bridging the gap between retail and institutional trading environments, fostering a cohesive ecosystem that supports diverse global trading needs. This strategic move aligns with ATFX’s broader project of creating an integrated trading environment where different client types can interact seamlessly.

Client-Centric Vision

He stated, “This strategic partnership will revolutionize our pricing capabilities and provide our clients with more competitive and accurate pricing. We are committed to constantly adapting and improving our services to meet the ever-evolving needs of our clients.”

The integration of PriceOn into the ATFX platform is the latest milestone that underscores the company’s dedication to innovation and excellence in trading solutions.
