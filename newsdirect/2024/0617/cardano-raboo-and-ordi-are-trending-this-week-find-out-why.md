Cardano's trend this week and its causesCardano (ADA) has always been present in the crypto news arena, and recently, it has been back in the news again. As of June 17, 2024, it is being traded around $0.402. But it's not just about the price; the attention that is paid to Cardano is mostly focused on the next steps in its evolution.

On June 9, Charles Hoskinson, creator of Cardano, announced on X that Cardano’s upcoming Chang fork is approaching quickly and that Cardano Node will likely reach version 9.0 this month. This update will improve the network for executing smart contracts. This is a significant development in Cardano and can place it at the same level as some of the leading Smart Contracts platforms, such as Ethereum. Cardano has many enthusiasts waiting for the actualisation of the proposed technology, and with this update, Cardano may pave itself as one of the great blockchains. While some analysts remain bullish about Cardano, we have seen that the future of this coin is still undecided, and only time will tell whether it will bring hope to its army of investors.

The recent trend of OrdiOrdi (ORDI) is the dark horse newcomer shaking things up in the crypto world. While it may not be a household name yet, ORDI has recently seen a surge in interest. As of June 17, 2024, ORDI is trading around $41.80. But what's behind this uptick in attention?

One factor could be Ordi’s new partnership with BidoFinance, a Bitcoin staking protocol, which has garnered significant community interest and contributed to the token's breakout. Ordi's unique value proposition as an "Inscriptions" cryptocurrency is also generating interest. This is where inscriptions are helpful; users can write informative text on the Bitcoin blockchain, and the information can never be erased, which paves the way for owning digital art or having a decentralised way of storing particular data.

Altogether, Ordi is quite a young project, but its potential and new essential features alongside new partnerships attracted attention. On one hand, market gurus have undertaken forecasts that Ordi is a coin with the potential to grow in the future, while on the other hand, there are sceptics who are of the contrary opinion. Only time will tell if Ordi can live up to the hype, but one thing's for sure: it is a coin we should watch.

Raboo: The memecoin with a mastermind Cardano and Ordi might be grabbing headlines, but the real party is happening in the meme coin realm, and Raboo is the guest of honour. This isn't your average doge-faced token chasing fleeting trends. Raboo's more like a meme maestro conducting an orchestra.

Raboo's presale has been a smash hit, bringing in over a cool $1.7 million and rocketing a mind-blowing 60% since the presale started. But Raboo's not just about the hype. They've got the tech chops to back it up. Raboo's AI-powered meme generator lets you easily unleash your inner creator and craft viral content. Also, Raboo's "Post-to-Earn" platform rewards you for your humour.

Experts are predicting a meteoric rise for Raboo, with some whispers of a 100x surge. With its innovative features and gamified social experience (coined SocialFi), Raboo is poised to become a memecoin leader. This is your chance to join the Raboo revolution. While Cardano and Ordi ponder their next moves, Raboo's already started the party. Get in early and make massive profits.
