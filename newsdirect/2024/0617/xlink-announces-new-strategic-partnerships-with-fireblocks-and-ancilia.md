# XLink Announces New Strategic Partnerships with Fireblocks and Ancilia

ALEX Lab’s XLink, as part of its continuing commitment to remain at the forefront of security in the DeFi space, is announcing several strategic partnerships to enhance both its security framework and operational capabilities.

The first new partnership will see XLink join forces with Fireblocks, an enterprise-grade platform renowned for its secure infrastructure in managing digital asset operations. The collaboration aims to enhance XLink’s wallet and smart contract management by leveraging Fireblocks’ advanced MPC (Multi-Party Computation) technology.

Fireblocks’ MPC technology will provide XLink with robust security measures for wallet and smart contract management, ensuring the highest levels of protection for digital assets. The integration will streamline XLink’s digital asset operations, enabling secure, scalable, and efficient digital asset management while paving the way for future innovations and growth in the space.

Fireblocks is the first company to achieve Cryptocurrency Security Standard (CSSS) Qualified Service Provider Level III certification by the Cryptocurrency Certification Consortium (C4). It’s also SOC2 Type III Certified and has received ISO certifications for security (ISO 27001), cloud (ISO 27017), and privacy (ISO 27018).

The second partnership announcement is in response to the recent security breach. XLink is taking immediate and decisive action to strengthen its security framework and restore user confidence by partnering with leading Web3 security firm Ancilia. Through this partnership, XLink aims to become the most secure Bitcoin liquidity aggregator in the DeFi space, ensuring robust protection for users.

Teaming up with Ancilia will help fortify XLink’s platform in a number of ways, including continuous monitoring and real-time threat detection which provides instant alerts and enables proactive measures to prevent breaches. Ancilia’s technology offers a holistic security framework, covering all aspects of XLink’s operations from smart contracts to user interactions.

By adopting Ancilia’s advanced security measures, XLink aims to instill confidence in its users that their digital assets are protected by the most robust security infrastructure available. This partnership underscores XLink’s unwavering dedication to security and user protection.

XLink has already partnered with digital asset custody provider Cobo to enhance crypto management and establish new security standards in the blockchain industry. The collaboration is an essential part of XLink’s strategy to grow its influence in the Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi) space.

By integrating Cobo’s advanced MPC technology, XLink has ensured unmatched security management of digital assets on its platform, preventing unauthorized access and boosting trust.
