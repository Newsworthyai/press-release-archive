# Family Justice Center of Washington County Selects Comcast Business to Support Bandwidth and Reliable Connectivity

Comcast Business is providing Family Justice Center of Washington County (FJCWC) – an organization dedicated to ending the cycle of domestic and family violence by providing safety, healing and hope to residents in Washington County, Oregon – with Comcast Business Ethernet Dedicated Internet (EDI) and Comcast Business Voice Mobility Solutions. The services help ensure reliability and speed for FJCWC’s network, creating a technological foundation that supports the organization’s growing connectivity needs today and in the future.

Often, survivors of violence and abuse have to travel to multiple disparate locations to access the valuable resources they need – but because many don’t know how to go about finding these resources, they give up. Since 2018, this hasn’t been the case in Washington County, OR, as FJCWC offers a variety of services to survivors in one convenient place, including access to advocacy, counseling, restraining orders, safety planning, legal aid, food assistance and much more. FJCWC is built on a foundation of trust, mutual collaboration and connection. Survivors of violence trust the organization to provide top-notch services that help put their minds at ease – and technology is crucial to doing so effectively and efficiently.

“Comcast understands what it is that we're trying to do and the importance of what we’re trying to do, and has really stepped in and stepped up to support our organization,” said Rachel Schutz, Executive Director of FJCWC. “They've stepped in to provide support in multiple different ways so that our service is reliable, and so that we can partner in the longer term.”

Comcast Business Voice Mobility Solutions streamline how FJCWC communicates with survivors, staff and partners. An important feature of this solution is the ability to route calls when someone is unable to pick up, as the organization’s phone system includes 24/7 crisis lines and acts as a call tree for partner organizations. Meanwhile, Comcast Business EDI provides the speed to tackle high bandwidth needs, a key component to supporting FJCWC’s virtual court system and virtual legal and benefits assistance. While these systems use significant bandwidth, it’s critical they are always able to function, emphasizing the importance for FJCWC to work with a reliable connectivity provider.

The virtual court, which FJCWC offered prior to the pandemic that popularized virtual meetings, allows survivors to avoid being in the same room with somebody who has harmed them. Comcast Business’ connectivity is key to provide reliable connectivity for virtual court sessions and meetings, especially if a survivor has applied for a restraining order.

“Technology is essential to the day-to-day operations of organizations, like FJCWC, that support victims of abuse, as it can help these organizations provide their clients with a sense of comfort and security that they may have never felt in the past,” said Rob Brenner, Vice President of Comcast Business for Comcast’s Pacific Northwest Region. “Comcast Business has established itself as a company that deeply cares about both the quality of solutions it provides as well as how those solutions can best help the often-critical missions of its customers. We’re proud to be supporting the FJCWC with technology solutions that enable their team to help and heal survivors within our community.”

About Family Justice Center of Washington County In 2014 our community convened a group of over 60 stakeholders including elected officials, service providers, law enforcement, community members, and most importantly, survivors, to design something new. After four years of planning, the Family Justice Center of Washington County opened its doors. Now, in one place, survivors have access to advocacy, counseling, restraining orders, safety planning, legal aid, food assistance and much more provided by a committed group of agencies, and coordinated for seamless access. Since opening in 2018 we have served over 21,700 survivors, and we envision a future in which that number is zero.
