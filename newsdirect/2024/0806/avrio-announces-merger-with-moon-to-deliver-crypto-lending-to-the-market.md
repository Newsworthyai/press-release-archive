# Avrio Announces Merger With Moon To Deliver Crypto Lending To The Market

Avrio Worldwide, PBC (Avrio) announces a merger with Moon Mortgage Inc. (Moon) through a bi-directional common stock acquisition between Avrio and Moon. The merger partnership will focus on delivering crypto lending products to retail and non-retail markets, including through the Avrio ecosystem of companies and partners.

Moon specializes in collateralized crypto lending products to enable customers access to money for discretionary expenses, purchases, and mortgages, without losing the ability to trade those crypto assets once the loan is taken out. Customers can trade crypto and borrow against it with confidence knowing Moon does not lend out their assets.

AVRIO is the parent of several companies delivering digital financial market infrastructure, services, and data across public, private, and digital markets. The deal marks another milestone for Avrio’s ecosystem of companies that develop and scale new and innovative digital financial products and services to retail and non-retail markets.

Commenting on the merger with Moon, Avrio CEO Lawrence Wintermeyer said, “The success of the launch of the bitcoin and ETH ETFs has demonstrated the pent-up demand in the market for crypto with BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF setting the record of the fastest growing ETF in history. Moon’s un-hypothecated lending products mean customers can be assured that when they borrow against their BTC or ETH, that their assets are not then lent out, and they can trade against those assets with confidence.”

Aaron Nevin, Moon Co-founder, and CEO says, “Of all the partners we were looking at for a Moon strategic partnership, Avrio offered the most innovate platform with a world class team and ecosystem of companies and partners for us to work with. The opportunity to get our products in the market in weeks through the Avrio ecosystem, with the opportunity to extend to global markets, was the real deal maker for Moon.”
