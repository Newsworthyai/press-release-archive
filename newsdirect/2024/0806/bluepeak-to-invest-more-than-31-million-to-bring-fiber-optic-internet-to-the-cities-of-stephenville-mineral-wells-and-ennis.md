# Bluepeak to Invest More Than $31 Million to Bring Fiber Optic Internet to the Cities of Stephenville, Mineral Wells, and Ennis

Bluepeak is investing more than $31 million to expand its fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) network to the cities of Stephenville, Mineral Wells, and Ennis, Texas. The network expansion will bring a new fast, affordable, reliable fiber internet option to more than 22,000 homes and businesses starting in 2025.

“We promised to build out our network in underserved areas, reaching more new locations with fiber in 2025,” said Bluepeak CEO, Rich Fish. “This latest network expansion actively delivers on that commitment in areas where connectivity will make a dramatic impact to the local economy. In all three of these markets, we aim to empower local businesses, support educational advancements, and facilitate seamless connectivity for residents.”

“Reliable access supports the core needs of every community, both homes and businesses, serving as a catalyst for growth, innovation, and opportunity,” said Mike Harry, Chief Business Development Officer of Bluepeak. “We look forward to continuing to work closely with local leaders and community members to ensure our services are contributing positively to their everyday lives.”

Since 2021, Bluepeak has been dramatically improving broadband options by bringing fast, dependable, fiber internet with transparent pricing to residents of Oklahoma, Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota and soon-to-be Texas. With Bluepeak Fiber Internet service, customers get fiber-fast speeds, equal upload and download speeds and whole-home WiFi. Bluepeak service features all-in pricing, where the price on the website is the price on the bill, with a minimum service tier of 1 gigabit-per-second (Gbps). Homes can get up to 5 Gbps and businesses 10 Gbps and beyond. Each fiber internet speed package includes Wi-Fi powered by eero, along with the added value of eero Secure, which protects devices from online threats, ads and allows for customized content filtering. Bluepeak's fiber network provides reliable connectivity and the bandwidth to connect more devices for internet, streaming, gaming and more.

Ultimately, Bluepeak service increases broadband competition for internet consumers by offering an advanced fiber connection in communities where choices have traditionally been very limited.
