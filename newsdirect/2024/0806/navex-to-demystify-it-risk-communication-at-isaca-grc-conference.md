# NAVEX to Demystify IT Risk Communication at ISACA GRC Conference

NAVEX, the global leader in integrated risk and compliance management software, will deliver a key session at the upcoming ISACA Governance, Risk, and Control (GRC) Conference in Austin, Texas, August 12-14, 2024. The session, "Getting Our Wires Crossed: How to Speak IT Risk as a Compliance Professional," will be presented by Kyle Martin, Vice President of GRC Solutions at NAVEX, and Robert Clark, Chief Audit and Compliance Officer at Howard University.

In an era where cybersecurity threats and regulatory pressures are at an all-time high, the ability to effectively communicate IT risks across organizational silos has become a critical skill for compliance professionals.

Attendees can join the session, CS 7–4, on August 13th at 11:00 to gain valuable insights into:

* Understanding and translating risk and compliance terminology.
* Evaluating program maturity levels and their organizational implications.
* Assessing risks and controls across all business facets, including third-party risk management.
* Crafting compelling IT risk reports for executive teams and board directors.

"In today's interconnected business environment, the ability to translate IT risk insights into compelling narratives for CEOs is no longer optional—it's essential," said Kyle Martin. "As a result, this session aims to empower compliance professionals with the tools they need to navigate this critical intersection confidently."

The ISACA GRC Conference, now in its 11th year, brings together leading minds in governance, risk management, and control to provide world-class content and practical guidance. NAVEX's participation underscores its commitment to advancing the field of integrated risk and compliance management.
