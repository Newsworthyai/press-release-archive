“We are excited to bring back an event that celebrates the artistry and innovation within the hair extensions industry. It is a unique platform for stylists and extension artists to connect and learn from each other,” says BELLAMI President Mary Burns. “We are the only extension company to host an event this large and this year’s showcase will be the first glimpse into our diverse range of Advanced Education offerings for 2025 and provide a sneak peek into several new innovations including a collection that will expand our offerings to a broader, more inclusive audience.”

The three-day event takes place at The Palms Hotel, Las Vegas, and encompasses informative mainstage presentations, business panels, advanced hands-on classes and networking events including a celebratory party.

Jessica Iozzo and Caitlin Meehan will join the business panel to share their experience building successful businesses out of hair extensions.

The dynamic mainstage presentations and business panels, accessible to all General Admission and VIP guests, will encompass stimulating visuals on cutting edge styling techniques, recounts of the personal journeys from some of our most successful partners, and illuminating discussions on trending topics within the extension business industry. The advanced ‘Look & Learn’ classes will take a deeper dive into these subjects and are available with an additional ticket purchase. Guests can purchase bundled packages to attend up to three courses at a discounted rate.

The ‘Look & Learn’ classes serve as a pilot program for a comprehensive educational series in 2025 and provide real-time feedback on what BELLAMI’s audience is most excited about.
