# Comcast Partners with Legendary Mexican Rock Band EL TRI to Provide Sign Language Interpretation for the First Time at Upcoming Music in the Park Concert

Comcast has partnered with legendary Mexican rock band, EL TRI to provide sign language interpretation for their June 22 Music in the Park performance at Plaza de Cesar Chavez in San Jose. This marks the first time that EL TRI, whose lyrics are in Spanish, will perform with sign language interpreters to provide greater accessibility to deaf and hard-of-hearing, fans.

Comcast recently announced the availability of live American Sign Language (ASL) interpreting services at eight Bay Area Xfinity Store locations. Customers who need ASL support can visit any of the eight Bay Area Xfinity Stores, where representatives will utilize ASL Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) to access a live interpreter provided by partner, Communication Service for the Deaf (CSD).

EL TRI, one of Latin America's most iconic rock bands, will perform as part of San Jose’s popular Music in the Park summer concert series. The addition of ASL interpreters underscores Comcast’s dedication to accessibility and community engagement.

"We are thrilled to be part of this wonderful initiative," said Alex Lora, lead singer of EL TRI. "Music is a universal language, and it’s important that everyone, regardless of their hearing ability, can share in the experience and energy of our live performances. We can’t wait to rock out with all our fans in San Jose!"

In addition to the interpreting services at the concert and in its stores, Comcast recently announced $60,000 in grants to three community partners: San Francisco LightHouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired, California School for the Deaf and the World Institute on Disability. These grants aim to broaden the scope of digital inclusion and accessibility to deaf and hard-of-hearing students, families, seniors, and community members.

The American Community Survey (ACS) estimates that 3.6% of the U.S. population is “deaf or have serious difficulty hearing.” Additionally, according to Pew Research Center, 23% of people with disabilities say they never go online, with 57% saying they do not have a home broadband connection. That’s why, through its Project UP initiative, Comcast is working to address and eliminate the unique barriers to connectivity through a series of efforts, including Internet Essentials, Lift Zones, and skill development and training.

Continuing Comcast’s ongoing commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility, this event, in collaboration with Pro Bono ASL, aims to make the EL TRI concert more inclusive for the deaf and the hard-of-hearing.

“This historical event is meaningful because these interpreters are trilingual. They know Spanish, English and American Sign Language which is creating inclusivity within the Latino deaf community which often tends to be left behind,” said Rorri Burton, Founder and Director of Pro Bono ASL, an organization that specializes in bringing immigrant, first-gen, transracial adoptees, queer, multilingual and multicultural ASL interpreters to concerts, festivals and events across the U.S. “We are grateful to Comcast for demonstrating inclusivity and commitment to the Latino deaf community.”

In addition to interpreting the iconic lyrics of EL TRI to fans at the concert, interpreters from Pro Bono ASL will translate the announcers of the traditional Lucha Libre matches that Music in the Park will offer as entertainment to attendees before the concert. The matches will feature local wrestlers such as "El Gladiador del aire” El Viento and "Rey de las pesadillas” El Cucuy.
