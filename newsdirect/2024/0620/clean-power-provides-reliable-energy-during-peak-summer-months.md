Staying cool in your home in the hottest months of summer is dependent on enough energy being produced and reliable delivery of that energy. On a state and local level, as the electricity grid becomes more stressed not only by increasingly frequent severe weather events, but also by increasing electricity demand, clean energy is serving as a fundamental pillar in bolstering grid reliability.

According to the American Clean Power Association, clean energy industry powers more of the United States every day and contributes more to the economy than any other source of energy. Nearly one fifth of all energy in the U.S. is provided by clean power.

With just the utility-scale solar, wind, and energy storage systems operating in the U.S. today, we’ve achieved massive environmental benefits through reducing carbon emissions. Clean energy projects already on the grid avoid 426 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year – that’s equivalent to the total emissions 50 billion gallons of gasoline would produce.

As the world becomes more susceptible to extreme weather, clean energy remains sustainable by not using precious water resources for cooling like conventional power plants. These projects save an estimated 211 billion gallons of water each year across the country, enough to fill 319,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools.

On June 6th Jason Grumet, American Clean Power Association, Chief Executive Officer conducted a nationwide media tour discussing these topics:

· The role clean energy will play in powering the US in the summer.

· Local data on your state ranks in clean energy creation and share of electricity.

· How is it affecting the air we breathe.

· National security implications and the usage of clean energy.
