ACE Resource Network hosted “Coffee con Conchas,” a celebration of community and connection, in downtown Sacramento last month as part of its ongoing campaign, Together in Healing. Based on current available data, the campaign has reached millions nationwide, including tens of thousands throughout the Sacramento community.

A vibrant event, “Coffee con Conchas'' brought together community leaders, media, and influencers to participate in a variety of immersive activities and engage with resources curated to help support healing from childhood trauma.

Designed to provide a platform for community resilience and healing, the day included a community art project, space for meditation and quiet reflection, healing circles, and space for connecting in conversation. Attendees engaged in activities designed to help foster emotional and mental well-being, informed by NumberStory.org.

The Together In Healing campaign offers resources in both English and Spanish. Much of the social media content for the campaign uses a combination of both languages. This inclusive approach ensures that a wider audience can benefit from the valuable information provided, helping to bridge cultural and generational gaps, and strengthen community ties.

The Together In Healing campaign continues to engage and support community members in Sacramento County and beyond.
