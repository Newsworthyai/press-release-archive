# Arrow Exploration Announces Successful Production and Future Plans at Carrizales Norte Field

Arrow Exploration CEO Marshall Abbott joined Steve Darling from Proactive to share significant updates on the company's operational activities, focusing on the multi-horizon Carrizales Norte field in the Tapir Block, located in the Llanos Basin of Colombia. Arrow has successfully commenced production from the first of four planned Ubaque horizontal wells for 2024. This inaugural horizontal well on the Carrizales Norte "B" pad has exceeded expectations, achieving a restricted flow rate of 3,150 barrels of oil per day (BOPD) gross, with less than 1% water cut while still recovering load fluid.

Abbott detailed that this well was drilled to a total measured depth of 11,680 feet, featuring a horizontal section of approximately 2,042 feet. The pay zone is composed of clean sandstone, exhibiting consistent 28% porosity and high resistivity, characteristics similar to those observed in previous wells.

The drilling rig has now been relocated to the second cellar on the Carrizales Norte B Pad. The company plans to drill a dedicated water disposal well (CNB-2) next. Following this, Arrow Exploration intends to drill three additional horizontal wells on the B pad, with longer horizontal sections expected to enhance production rates and ultimate recovery. Additionally, the company will drill the Baquiano-1 exploration well, which aligns with the trend of the Carrizales Norte field.

These developments underscore Arrow Exploration's strategic efforts to optimize production and enhance recovery rates at the Carrizales Norte field, reinforcing the company's commitment to expanding its operational footprint and maximizing resource extraction in the Llanos Basin.
