# Fueled by Seed Round and Partner Adoption, Synergist Technology Delivers Always-On AI Governance and Compliance

Synergist Technology, a leader in Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance and compliance, is poised for expansive growth following the company’s debut in 2023. Upon closing its $5 million seed funding round last month, the company has significantly grown its client base, working with partners like Microsoft to ensure AI solutions meet industry compliance and global governance standards. Synergist Technology's AFFIRM software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering enables users to implement a holistic AI governance framework that encompasses model documents, proactive monitoring of AI policies and assets to detect compliance and model risks, and governance, risk and compliance (GRC) reporting, empowering users to navigate the complexities of the AI governance landscape.

“With the global AI market projected to reach $1.81 billion by 2030, it’s imperative to have transparency and compliance integrated into the integrations we’re seeing across industries,” said Elycia Morris, Chief Executive Officer Synergist Technology. “That’s what we’re looking to do at Synergist. We’re encouraged to see our partners prioritize responsible AI and are thrilled to work alongside them in forums such as Microsoft’s Government AI Summit.”

With a unique system that tests against published standards and any AI assets, AFFIRM leverages human expertise to manage risks and build trust in client’s AI systems. This safeguard ensures that AI produces fair and unbiased outputs, enhances companies’ reliability and trustworthiness, and ensures alignment with current and future government policies. AFFIRM monitors the performance of AI integration executed by businesses, governments, and consultancies and assists in understanding risks by providing real-time risk assessment dashboards.

“I absolutely recognize the growing need for AI compliance, and I believe Synergist Technology is a trusted partner who has shared our vision of understanding the present challenges of both mitigating risk and data compromise in today’s climate of national and global security,” said Vishal Amin, General Manager of Security Solutions, Microsoft. “Their commitment to developing responsible AI compliance tools is both clear and concise. We are beyond excited about the current and ongoing collaboration between both our teams as they empower every organization, agency and governmental entity to achieve more.”

“AI uptake is moving at warp speed, and knowing that the information is trustworthy is a real concern for regulators and the public alike,” said Executive Chairman Brad Levine. “Synergist Technology has built a total compliance solution that helps business leaders ensure that their AI systems are used safely and competently. With AFFIRM, we have created a solution that places trust and peace of mind at our clients' fingertips; we help them stay ahead of the compliance curve in an ever-changing AI environment.”

With the growing complexity and widespread deployment of AI systems, Synergist Technology’s platform is tailor-made to provide fairness and transparency in AI. This starts by building trust with regulators, the public, and its clients' customers and user bases.
