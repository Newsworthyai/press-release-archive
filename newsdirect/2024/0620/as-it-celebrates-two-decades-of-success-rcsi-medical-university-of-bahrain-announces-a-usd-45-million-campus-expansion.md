RCSI Medical University of Bahrain Announces a USD 45 Million Campus Expansion

The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland - Medical University of Bahrain (RCSI Bahrain) announced its plans for the expansion of its campus in a strategic project valued at USD 45 million, as it marked the celebration of its 20th anniversary in Bahrain. In line with a steadfast commitment to contributing with excellence towards the improvement of human health, patient care, and societal well-being, the University has consistently achieved pivotal milestones since its establishment, placing innovative research at the heart of its services through the School of Postgraduate Studies and Research, with a focus on interdisciplinary clinical and patient-centred research, as well as addressing key national, regional, and global health challenges.

Recently, RCSI Medical University of Bahrain signed an agreement with Nass Corporation for the construction of the University’s campus expansion project. The ambitious expansion includes a brand new state-of-the-art academic building designed to address the growing demand for advanced medical education and research facilities with the addition of 7,912 sqm of usable space, featuring the addition of enhanced teaching facilities, cutting-edge research labs, a modern library, social spaces, and a spacious event hall. Emphasising a vested commitment towards sustainability, the project includes adopting low-carbon transportation options through bike racks and EV charging stations. Beyond this, the design will incorporate energy-efficient features such as solar panels, LED lighting, and water conservation systems, with a focus on incorporating heat-reduction practices through the incorporation of native plants and green spaces into the landscape, as part of RCSI Bahrain’s commitment to fostering an environmentally friendly ecosystem that nurtures a sense of well-being.

Professor Sameer Otoom, President of RCSI Medical University of Bahrain, said, “As we celebrate our 20th anniversary in Bahrain, we are proud to celebrate this milestone, boasting a diverse network of over 3,000 alumni and healthcare professionals from 56 nationalities comprising 459 doctors and 1,321 nurses, which have significantly contributed to strengthening Bahrain's comprehensive healthcare system.”

The President of RCSI Bahrain added, “A living reflection of RCSI's dedication to sustainability and commitment to providing an ideal environment for our faculty and students to thrive and developing new programmes, our planned campus expansion aligns with Bahrain's vision to cement itself as a leading regional hub for healthcare and education, benefiting from a highly skilled workforce, welcoming and tolerant community, and exceptional lifestyle.”

Munther Almudawi, Executive Director of Business Development for Healthcare, Education, and Tourism at Bahrain EDB said, “At Bahrain EDB, we offer our support to investors through every step of their journey, long after they first set up in Bahrain. First founded as the national training body for surgery in Ireland, RCSI has continued to be at the forefront of healthcare education since its establishment in 1784. With a long-standing history of innovation, we take pride in RCSI Bahrain’s 20 years of milestone successes on the island and look forward to witnessing the development of its sustainably-led campus expansion project, which will add value to the diversity of Bahrain’s highly-developed education and healthcare ecosystems, which aims to provide service quality on par with the global playing field.”

In a comprehensive National Economic Contribution Report delivered by PwC Ireland, the impact of RCSI Medical University of Bahrain on the national economy was determined to be an estimated annual contribution of USD 91 million. The calculated contribution encompasses various aspects of the University's operations, including day-to-day activities, cutting-edge facilities, state-of-the-art equipment, student expenditures, and the economic ripple effect generated by the spending of visiting friends and relatives of international students enrolled. Furthermore, the upcoming construction and outfitting of the new academic building is projected to inject an additional USD102 million into the economy over a four-year period.

Beyond its economic impact, RCSI Medical University of Bahrain continues to play a pivotal role in Bahrain's socio-economic development by initiating programs to enhance the skills of the local healthcare workforce, contributing to national research priorities, and championing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) sustainability. The University's activities directly and indirectly support 437 jobs, fostering growth and opportunity within the community. Furthermore, the university's staffing requirements continue growing to meet the expanding student body and research endeavours. Of the 227 full-time staff members employed by RCSI Bahrain, 50% are Bahraini nationals who benefit from a wide range of continuous professional development programs.
