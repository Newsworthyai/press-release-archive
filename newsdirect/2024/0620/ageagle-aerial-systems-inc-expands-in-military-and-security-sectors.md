# AgEagle Aerial Systems Inc. Expands in Military and Security Sectors

AgEagle Aerial Systems CEO Bill Irby joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce a significant new contract for the company. AgEagle has secured a purchase order to deliver 20 eBee VISION full-stack systems, including control systems, batteries, backpacks, and limited spares, to a leading distributor in the United Arab Emirates. This contract is valued at approximately $2 million for the fiscal year 2024. The company operates three centres of excellence concentrating on drones, specialty cameras, and control software. The company delivers fully integrated systems combining sensors, aircraft, robotic technologies, and control systems.

Irby emphasized that this contract underscores the global need for enhanced public safety and security. The deal supports a government customer with best-in-class UAV defense solutions for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions.

This announcement follows closely on the heels of another milestone for AgEagle: the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) recently completed training for National Guardsmen using AgEagle's eBee TAC drone. This drone, which is NDAA-compliant, is the first fixed-wing UAV to be added to the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) Blue UAS list and cleared to fly over humans.

Looking forward, AgEagle aims to maintain its growth in the military domain while continuing to support its legacy customers in agriculture and other civil sectors. The primary goal for the remainder of the year and into 2025 is to fulfil customer commitments and further develop their strategic plans.
