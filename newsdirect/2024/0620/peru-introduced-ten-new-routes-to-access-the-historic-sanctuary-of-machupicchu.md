# Peru introduced ten new routes to access the Historic Sanctuary of Machupicchu

Peru introduced ten new routes to access the Historic Sanctuary of Machupicchu during the high season, from June 1 to October 15, 2024 and from December 30 to 31, 2024. Also, within this period, the visitors maximum capacity at this wonder of the world expanded to 5600 per day.

The routes are articulated and programmed with established capacity and shifts in order to preserve the archaeological heritage and guarantee an optimal visitor experience.

Peru has developed initiatives to ensure the long-term sustainability of its tourism sector. The country's commitment to sustainable tourism practices protects its emblematic destinations. For example, Machu Picchu is the first tourism destination to achieve carbon neutral international certification.

The IPERÚ service, provided by the government free of charge, offers tourists official and up-to-date information about the country.
