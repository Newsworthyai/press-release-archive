# Inc. Magazine Names Goodway Group One of the Best Places to Work for Third Year in a Row

Goodway Group, a leading independent digital marketing agency, is proud to announce that it has been recognized as one of Inc. Magazine's Best Workplaces for the third consecutive year. This prestigious award honors companies that have created exceptional environments where employees are engaged, motivated, and committed to their work.

Goodway Group continues to lead how the future of work evolves. With a steadfast commitment to a 100% remote workforce since 2008, the company’s values are rooted in employee well-being, continual learning, and unparalleled flexibility. By embracing work-life integration, teams are encouraged to bring their authentic self to work each day to deliver exceptional outcomes for clients.

"Our approach, inspired by the infinity loop, is both simple and transformative: By prioritizing our employees, we ignite client success, creating an endless cycle of shared prosperity," said Kandi Gongora, Chief Transformation and People Officer at Goodway Group. "We are unwavering in our commitment to our team, offering flexible scheduling and fully remote work to support their personal and professional aspirations. Our dedication to continuous skill development ensures our employees remain relevant and future-ready, evolving alongside the ever-changing needs of our clients."

Inc. Magazine's Best Workplaces 2024 list is the result of a rigorous evaluation process, including a comprehensive survey of employees and an evaluation of company policies, practices, and culture. The winners are chosen based on their ability to create a positive and productive work environment, as well as their commitment to employee satisfaction and engagement.

The selection process involves the following steps:

1. Employee Survey: Inc. Magazine conducts an anonymous survey of employees at participating companies, asking questions about their job satisfaction, company culture, and overall work environment.
2. Company Evaluation: Inc. Magazine's editorial team evaluates the company's policies, practices, and culture, including factors such as employee benefits, professional development opportunities, and work-life balance.
3. Data Analysis: Inc. Magazine analyzes the survey data and company evaluations to identify the top-scoring companies in each category.
4. Final Selection: The top-scoring companies are selected as Inc. Magazine's Best Places to Work.

"Our infinity loop principle ensures that everything we do for our clients makes Goodway a great place for employees to grow their career, and everything we do for our employees grows our clients’ business," said Jay Friedman, CEO of Goodway Group. " When thousands of companies’ employees are asked anonymously by an outside party to rate their workplace, these are results worth paying attention to and for us, something to be proud of."
