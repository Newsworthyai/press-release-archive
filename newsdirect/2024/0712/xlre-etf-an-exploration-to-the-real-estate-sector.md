DISCLOSURES

The S&P 500 Index is an unmanaged index of 500 common stocks that is generally considered representative of the U.S. stock market. The index is heavily weighted toward stocks with large market capitalizations and represents approximately two-thirds of the total market value of all domestic common stocks. The S&P 500 Index figures do not reflect any fees, expenses or taxes. An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, fees and expenses before investing.

One may not invest directly in an index.

Transparent ETFs provide daily disclosure of portfolio holdings and weightings

All ETFs are subject to risk, including loss of principal. Sector ETF products are also subject to sector risk and non-diversification risk, which generally will result in greater price fluctuations than the overall market. Diversification does not eliminate risk.

An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses carefully before investing. To obtain a prospectus, which contains this and other information, call 1-866-SECTOR-ETF (732-8673) or visit www.sectorspdrs.com. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
