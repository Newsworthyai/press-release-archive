# PROMPERÚ Launches Campaign Inviting Peruvians to Celebrate Their Cultural Diversity

In the latter half of the last century, composer Mario Cavagnaro emerged as an iconic figure, deeply enriching the country’s music. Among his most recognized songs is “Qué viva el Perú señores,” (Long live Peru, ladies and gentlemen) a gem of Creole music and a love letter to Peru.

This beautiful piece, updated with new rhythms and sounds, is the chosen song for the video manifesto of the new campaign presented by the Commission for the Promotion of Peru for Export and Tourism (PROMPERÚ): “Peru, land of infinite gifts.”

Performed by a Peruvian singer specializing in pop fusion and Andean music, and by an established cumbia band, the song's lyrics are illustrated by images showcasing invaluable heritage sites, renowned gastronomy, and cultural diversity.

In this month of national celebrations, the campaign aims to foster pride and unity among Peruvians. Peru’s brand, driven by PROMPERÚ, invites the public to connect with Peru's cultural diversity, infinite wealth, and ancient wisdom—essential elements for building national identity and a better future.
