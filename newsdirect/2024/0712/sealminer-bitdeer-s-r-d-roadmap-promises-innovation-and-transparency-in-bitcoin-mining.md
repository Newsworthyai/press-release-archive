In the spirit of driving greater transparency in the Bitcoin mining industry, Bitdeer has introduced its highly anticipated research & development (R&D) technology roadmap for its SEALMINER Bitcoin mining rig. The company is targeting the mass production of innovative power efficiency 5J/TH chips by Q4 2025 through strategic investments in research and development (R&D).

The motivations for SEALMINER are multi-pronged. As a Bitcoin mining leader, Bitdeer believes that transparent advancements in mining rig development are critical to miners’ success. As a result, miners can gain greater clarity into the entire Bitcoin hardware lifecycle, including technological advancements and timely deliveries of Bitcoin mining machines as well as a view into the data analytics of mining machine capabilities, investor buying behaviors, and equipment inventory.

“We believe that the financial models of Bitcoin miners are significantly impacted by price uncertainty. If these two aspects of transparency are not addressed, the mining community is more likely to suffer severe financial losses,” said Bitdeer Chief Business Officer Linghui Kong.

Bitdeer’s SEALMINER Roadmap Revealed The first milestone on Bitdeer’s SEALMINER roadmap is dubbed SEAL01, which involves the release of chip energy efficiency 18.1J/TH, announced in Q1 2024. That technology has already been integrated into SEALMINER A1, the company’s maiden mining machine.

Next is SEAL02, with an impressive energy efficiency of 14J/TH, reflecting wall-mount energy consumption in the range of 15J/TH-16.5J/TH. The upgrade, whose launch is expected in Q3 2024, represents Bitdeer’s second-generation SEALMINER mining machine. SEAL02 is on track for mass-production and deliveries by year-end 2024.

The introduction of the SEAL03 machine improves energy efficiency to 10J/TH, with a wall-mount power consumption of between 11J/TH and 12J/TH. SEAL03 represents Bitdeer’s third-generation SEALMINER mining machine and is poised for mass production and deliveries in Q2 2025.

Lastly, the SEAL04 machine, with an energy efficiency of a low 5J/TH, has an expected launch date of Q2 2025. The optimization of the mining machine's wall-mount power consumption is expected to be in the range of 5.5J/TH to 6J/TH. This fourth-generation SEALMINER mining machine is planned for mass-production with expected delivery starting in Q4 2025.

Bitdeer has a team of top engineers, representing 25% of the company’s total headcount, committed to the R&D process across specific chip technology applications, including ASIC design, algorithm development and platform architecture, as well as hardware and software design.

Bitdeer Grows By Leaps And Bounds Bitdeer is having a groundbreaking year in which it has entered its next phase of growth and development. In addition to its transparent SEALMINER roadmap, the company has ushered in a $150 million private placement by leading stablecoin provider Tether International, and has bolstered its ASIC chip capabilities through the recent acquisition of fabless crypto ASIC design company Desiweminer.

With Q1 revenue of $119.5 million, an annual increase of 64.6%, Bitdeer has momentum on its side. The company’s innovative ASIC technology led to a 65% increase in the number of bitcoins mined in the first three months of the year as Bitdeer inches closer toward a quarterly threshold of 1,000 bitcoins.

Investors who are bullish about the ASIC technology of the future, including a sustainable approach to the power-intensive process of Bitcoin mining that aims to reduce the industry’s carbon footprint and silence critics, could look into Bitdeer, during one of the most exciting times in Bitcoin history.
