# Mosquito Control Urgent as Virginia Faces Worst Season: Diamond Exterminators Provides Relief

This year, mosquitoes are proving to be a bigger nuisance than ever, particularly in Virginia. Multiple cities in Virginia have made the top list for the worst mosquito problems, with Norfolk ranking in the top 25 worst cities for mosquitos. Diamond Exterminators, a leader in pest control services, is stepping up to help residents combat this growing issue with their comprehensive mosquito control services.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the total human disease count of West Nile Virus (WNV) in 2023 was over 2,400, with 47 states, including Virginia, reporting cases. Experts warn that the problem could be even worse this year due to the mild and wet winter, making mosquito control more crucial than ever.

Connor Eason, Vice President of Diamond Exterminators, commented, “We recognize the heightened problems mosquitoes are causing this year. Balancing a treatment program that effectively controls mosquitoes while protecting pollinators is crucial. Significant advances in mosquito control have introduced safe alternatives. However, effective control involves more than just spraying; a skilled exterminator can also help you find simple ways to reduce the mosquito population and recommend natural alternatives.”

Diamond Exterminators not only offers advanced mosquito treatment programs but also provides valuable tips for homeowners to reduce mosquito populations in their yards. Here are some expert tips from Diamond Exterminators:

1. Eliminate Standing Water Mosquitoes breed in stagnant water, so regularly emptying water from flowerpots, birdbaths, and gutters can significantly reduce their numbers.

2. Maintain Your Yard: Keep grass and shrubs trimmed to minimize resting areas for mosquitoes.

3. Use Natural Repellents: Plant mosquito-repelling plants such as citronella, lavender, and marigolds.

4. Install Screens: Ensure all windows and doors have screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering your home.

5. Utilize Mosquito Traps: Strategic placement of mosquito traps can help reduce the mosquito population around your home.

As mosquito problems continue to rise, Diamond Exterminators remains committed to providing safe and effective solutions for the community. Their comprehensive approach to mosquito control ensures that residents can enjoy their outdoor spaces without the constant nuisance of mosquitoes.
