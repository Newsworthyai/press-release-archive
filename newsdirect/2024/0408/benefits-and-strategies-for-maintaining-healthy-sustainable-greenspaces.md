# Benefits and Strategies for Maintaining Healthy, Sustainable Greenspaces

--News Direct--

Homeowners are once again embracing the outdoors and taking steps to make sure their lawns are in top shape for the summer season. Recently, an expert from ScottsMiracle-Gro, Dr. Lakshmy Gopinath, and Professor at Utah State University, Dr. Kelly Kopp, participated in a nationwide satellite media tour to provide tips for establishing and maintaining a healthy lawn.

There are several things homeowners can do when it comes to sustainably establishing and maintaining their lawns this year.

First, it’s important to embrace turfgrass specific to your region, as grass types can vary widely depending on your particular climate. For example, cool season grasses like bluegrasses and fescues are suited best for the Northeast, while warm-season grasses like bermudagrass or buffalo grass are best for Southern regions. For another interesting option, you can opt for native turfgrass varieties that typically require less water and maintenance.

Second, be proactive about lawn care. Spring is when your lawn is waking up from dormant winter conditions, and is an essential time to seed and feed your lawn to ensure lush conditions later in the season. Seed with Scotts Turf Builder Grass Seed, then feed your lawn with Scotts Turf Builder Lawn Food. When considering the first watering for your lawn, try to delay as long as possible. This will put stress on your turf and drive deeper roots, ultimately encouraging a stronger and more resilient lawn.

Finally, mow at the right height. Grass mowed at the proper height develops a deeper root system to better find water and nutrients in the soil. Taller grass also shades the soil keeping it cooler - so try to set your mower to one of the highest settings to get a 3-4 inch cut.

There are many benefits to having sustainable green space, including:

● Improved ecosystems: Natural turfgrass has many benefits for the environment. Turfgrass absorbs carbon dioxide, releases oxygen, traps dust and dirt, reduces erosion by absorbing stormwater runoff, and can help protect nearby bodies of water. Greenspaces also have a cooling effect on the surrounding environment, which can offset urban heat.

● Improved quality of life: Natural green spaces provide immense health and wellness benefits for humans through physical and social activities, stress reduction, play, and reduced noise levels.

● Reduce water use with water-efficient turfgrasses: Choose turfgrass varieties specifically bred for water efficiency, such as fine fescues or buffalo grass, to save on your water bill. These grasses have evolved to thrive with minimal irrigation, helping conserve water resources while maintaining a lush, green lawn.

● Replenishing groundwater reserves: Natural turfgrass has the ability to absorb rainwater through a process called infiltration and help restore groundwater reserves, which is frequently tapped into by municipalities.
