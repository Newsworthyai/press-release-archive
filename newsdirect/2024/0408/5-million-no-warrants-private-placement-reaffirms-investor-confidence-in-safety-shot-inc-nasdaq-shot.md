# $5 Million No Warrants Private Placement Reaffirms Investor Confidence In Safety Shot Inc. (NASDAQ: SHOT)

--News Direct--

On April 4, Safety Shot, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHOT) announced a private placement of $5 million from a private institutional investor, Core 4 Capital Corp. The deal involved issuance of 2,369,668 shares at a price of $2.11 per share, and most importantly, no warrants were attached in the terms of the offering, illustrating investor confidence in the company. Safety Shot also didn't pay commissions in connection with the financing and incurred minimal expenses compared to most offerings that result in less than 90% of the proceeds actually going to the company.

Safety Shot CEO Jarret Boon commented, “We are thrilled to announce this straight equity investment into the Company from a single institutional investor priced at market price. This no-warrants private placement conveys that sophisticated investors are feeling confident about the Company and its new executive team.”

Proceeds from the private placement will be used for general corporate purposes and to primarily fund the continued advancement of the company’s Safety Shot beverage, which is positioned to create its own product category—rapid alcohol detoxification—in the growing alcohol detoxification market.

SHOT has emerged as a trailblazer in the beverage industry, pioneering a first-of-its-kind beverage designed to alleviate the effects of alcohol consumption rapidly. Their patented formula accelerates the detoxification process, leaving consumers feeling better faster, revolutionizing both nightlife experiences and morning recoveries.

Safety Shot, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHOT) leverages a meticulously crafted blend of scientifically proven ingredients, including vitamins, minerals, and nootropics, to enhance metabolic pathways responsible for breaking down blood alcohol levels. The formulation promotes faster alcohol breakdown, aiding in recovery and rehydration, thus setting a new standard in post-alcohol consumption care.

The formulation’s efficacy was established via rigorous blood alcohol content testing on dozens of test subjects. These subjects were administered breathalyzer tests to determine blood alcohol (BAC) levels both before and after consumption of Safety Shot. Within 30 minutes of consuming Safety Shot, subjects saw marked decreases in BAC.

To put Safety Shot’s massive opportunity in perspective, consider this: According to a recently released report from Zion Market Research, the global Hangover Cure Products market was worth around $3.22 billion in 2023 and is predicted to grow to around $9.45 billion by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of roughly 14.5% between 2024 and 2032. This growth is expected to be driven by the rise in social drinking and alcohol use, particularly among younger people.

In order to capitalize on this trend, Safety Shot, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHOT) has recently announced a number of new partnerships and distribution deals that will better position it in this rapidly growing market.

For instance, Safety Shot revealed a new collaboration with Launch 33 Brands, a leading brand-building agency and distributor based in Los Angeles, to amplify its presence in the vibrant Southern California market. Launch 33 Brands will execute a strategic brand building and placement plan for Safety Shot products in over 250 key retail accounts across the Los Angeles area. This agency and distributor partnership builds upon Safety Shot's existing success, complementing its presence in other key chain retailers.

Furthermore, the integration of GoPuff and BevMo into Safety Shot's distribution network marked a significant milestone in its expansion strategy. GoPuff and its beverage-themed BevMo link consumers to everyday necessities by acting as an interface of accessibility and convenience. With its inventory of approximately 4,000 products stored in local micro-fulfillment centers, GoPuff promises swift delivery of goods directly to consumers' doorsteps, redefining the shopping experience with unparalleled ease and efficiency.

This strategic partnership will not only enhance Safety Shot's market reach and visibility but will also position it as one of the key players in the wellness beverage industry. By leveraging these established platforms, Safety Shot gains access to a broader consumer base and opens doors to new avenues of growth and market penetration.

In addition to these new partnerships, Safety Shot, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHOT) has made several key management changes. For starters, the company had a pivotal leadership transition as Jarrett Boon succeeded Brian John as Chief Executive Officer. Boon has over 30 years of experience building successful businesses from creation to exit. He was one of the original thought leaders and investors in LifeLock, a leading identity protection provider that grew to over $500 million in revenue and was later acquired by Symantec in 2016 for $2.3 billion.

Safety Shot also appointed serial entrepreneur John Gulyas as Chairman of the Board. Gulyas was the Founder and President of GBB Drink Lab and co-founder of the Safety Shot beverage, and with multiple 7-figure exits under his belt, John Gulyas will help lead Safety Shot in its ongoing efforts to become a leading wellness beverage brand.
