# Genflow Biosciences attracts new institutional investors with £715,000 fundraise

--News Direct--

Genflow Biosciences PLC (LSE:GENF, OTCQB:GENFF) CEO Dr Eric Leire tells Proactive's Stephen Gunnion the company has successfully raised £715,000 through a mix of placements and subscriptions for new stock. This fundraising effort was notably supported by company directors, including Leire, and new institutional investors.

Leire highlighted the importance of this move as a strategic effort to stabilise and grow the company, especially noting the significance of attracting institutional investment. Historically, Genflow relied on grants and research funding, making this step a notable shift in its funding strategy.

Leire also mentioned the company's focus on longevity and healthspan, pointing out the increasing gap between lifespan and healthspan as a major healthcare and economic challenge. Genflow's approach to addressing age-related diseases has started to attract attention from the institutional market, recognizing the potential high upside in the longevity sector.

The funds raised are earmarked for continuing clinical trials in their three main programs: progeria, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and sarcopenia, aiming to reduce both financial and scientific risks by diversifying their portfolio.
