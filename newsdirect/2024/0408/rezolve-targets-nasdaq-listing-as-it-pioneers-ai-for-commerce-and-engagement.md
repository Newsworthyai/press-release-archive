# Rezolve targets Nasdaq listing as it pioneers AI for commerce and engagement

--News Direct--

Rezolve founder and CEO Dan Wagner joins Proactive's Stephen Gunnion with details of the platform specialising in commerce and engagement through innovative use of mobile and desktop technologies.

The company has developed a novel way for merchants to connect with consumers, notably through AI-generated watermarks in audio streams that prompt user engagement, and geofencing that triggers location-based interactions. It has been focusing on conversational AI, enabling seamless transactions like booking flights through voice commands.

Despite the complexity of interpreting product descriptions, Rezolve has addressed AI challenges like model drift and hallucinations, securing three patents in the process. Wagner highlighted Rezolve's unique position in the AI space, particularly in preventing AI from malfunctioning, a problem noted in technologies developed by giants like OpenAI and Google.

Recently, the company has attracted significant investment from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, supporting expansion into sectors beyond retail and commerce. Additionally, the company has partnered with Handlerbund in Germany, leveraging Europe's largest online trade association to further distribute its technology.

Wagner explained that Rezolve's revenue model revolves around three main products: Brain Commerce, Brain Checkout, and Brain Assistant, each catering to different aspects of digital commerce and corporate knowledge management.

A business combination with Armada Acquisition Corp is underway, aiming for a Nasdaq listing, underscoring Rezolve's global ambition and technological prowess.
