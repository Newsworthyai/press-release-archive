--News Direct--

Hank Helton, EVP and Chief Stakeholder Officer of Pathway Lending, Tennessee’s largest non-depository Community Development Financial Institution headquartered in Nashville, Tenn., was elected Chair of the Board of Directors of the CDFI Coalition during its March 15th meeting in Washington, DC.

The CDFI Coalition, formed in 1992, is the unified national voice of community development financial institutions. This year celebrates the 30th Anniversary of the passage of the Community Development Financial Institutions Bill which created the CDFI Fund at the US Department of Treasury.

“Hank’s leadership and expertise is a true asset to the Coalition, and its work bringing fair access to financial resources for America’s underserved people and communities,” said Coalition spokesperson Bob Rapoza.

Helton is a founding member of Pathway Lending, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year. As Chief Stakeholder Officer, Hank leads the cultivation and management of relationships with financial institutions, philanthropy, and local, state, and federal agencies.

“It’s a privilege and honor to serve as Chair of the CDFI Coalition, dedicated to advancing access to capital and resources for communities nationwide,” said Helton. “I extend my gratitude to the departing Chair, Ceyl Prinster, President and CEO of the Colorado Enterprise Fund, for her outstanding leadership. I am eager to build upon the progress already achieved to make an even greater impact.”

Helton was appointed as the Director of Development and Affordable Housing for Nashville/Davidson County Metropolitan Government from 2001-2007. Under Helton’s direction, the city received national attention for its initiatives and was recognized repeatedly for its creative and innovative approach to community development, particularly in the areas of affordable and downtown housing.

Helton also has more than a decade of experience at The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, advising financial institutions on safe, sound, and profitable community investment activities. His work has been recognized in the Harvard University Innovations in American Government Brookings Press publication "Governing by Network: The New Shape of the Public Sector," highlighting his efforts in building collaborations between public, for-profit, and non‐profit organizations.

Hank holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Community Planning and Development with a concentration in finance from Georgia State University, Atlanta. He is also certified as a Housing and Economic Development Finance Professional by the National Development Council.
