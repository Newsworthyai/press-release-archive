# Western Metallica Resources Intensifies Exploration at Luz Maria and Cana Brava 1 targets

--News Direct--

Western Metallica Resources Vice President of Exploration Giovanni Funaioli joined Steve Darling from Proactive to shared updates regarding the company's exploration activities at the Luz Maria and Cana Brava 1 targets.

Funaioli revealed that Western Metallica Resources is currently conducting geophysical and field mapping activities at these projects, building upon previous work that identified strong magnetic anomalies coincident with large alteration footprints characteristic of Andean copper-molybdenum porphyry systems.

The company plans to complete approximately 16-line kilometers of pole-dipole Induced Polarization (IP) geophysical surveys in the near term. These surveys aim to identify areas of sulphide-rich mineralization and potential blind intrusions beneath altered Cretaceous sedimentary rocks and recent colluvium.

Funaioli emphasized that the acquisition of geophysical data is supported by an in-house geophysicist with extensive experience in exploring for porphyry and intrusion-related systems in the Andes region. This geophysicist is responsible for daily quality control of the data, as well as processing and modeling.

Simultaneously, Western Metallica Resources is conducting systematic portable-XRF soil data acquisition to vectorize the distribution of copper (Cu) and molybdenum (Mo) at the surface. This is complemented by pole-dipole IP geophysical data acquisition to identify sulphide-rich and/or resistivity anomalies, indicating potential mineralized bodies beneath sedimentary and recent colluvial covers.

The ongoing field programs aim to extend mapping and sampling beyond the main creeks where mineralized intrusive outcrops have been found to date. This is intended to confirm the presence of significant and continuous copper-molybdenum porphyry mineralization with a higher level of geological confidence and across a broader alteration footprint.

Western Metallica Resources believes that integrating this large dataset will provide a comprehensive understanding of the prospects' potential, supporting the next phase of scout drilling expected to commence by Q3-2024.
