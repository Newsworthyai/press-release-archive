# Lisk Launches Mainnet and Airdrop Campaign with 15M LSK Tokens Available to Earn

Lisk, a leading Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain dedicated to empowering web3 builders in high-growth markets, is pleased to announce the launch of the Lisk Mainnet and the introduction of its Airdrop campaign, beginning on November 21st. This will be followed by an App Bounty Quest campaign launching by the end of the year. The first season of the airdrop will run for four months, incentivizing new users and builders to engage with Lisk’s blockchain ecosystem. In alignment with this effort, Lisk is implementing a comprehensive plan reflecting its past year's progress through strategic partnerships and various programs. This launch represents a new phase for Lisk, and the results will be closely monitored.

A 2023 report by analyst firm Chainalysis reveals that high-growth markets, which dominate its Crypto Adoption Index, are driving web3 adoption and highlight a key trend in global finance. Lisk's focus on high-growth markets is strategic, considering these regions' notable growth and adoption rates, positioning Lisk firmly for the future.

Key Highlights of the Airdrop Campaign:

1. User Engagement through Task Completion: Participants can earn points by completing tasks on the Lisk platform. The more tasks completed, the more points earned, leading to more LSK tokens airdropped based on total points accumulated.
2. Partnership-Driven “Super Tasks”: In collaboration with partners, including Oku.Trade, Ionic, Creo Engine, Angle Protocol, Soccersm, and Momint, Lisk will offer special tasks open for two weeks, providing boosted rewards designed to incentivize user engagement. Each partner will have a dedicated two-week period for users to complete the super tasks and earn immediate rewards. These super tasks will include educational and engagement-focused challenges announced throughout the campaign, encouraging users to actively participate and deepen their knowledge of the platform.
3. App Bounty Quests: Launching by the end of the year, the App Bounty Quests will reward applications that meet specific milestones set by the Lisk team, such as achieving a certain volume or number of active users monthly. Successful participants will receive a sizable LSK token bounty via airdrop.

“We designed this airdrop campaign to be seamless, engaging, educational, and even fun, reflecting our mission to create web3 applications that are easy to use and beneficial,” said Dominic Schwenter, COO of Lisk. “The promise of mass adoption rests in the vision and dedication of builders in high-growth markets who are solving everyday problems for their communities and businesses via blockchain technology. I hope participants find a deep connection to our mission as we pave the way together. This launch marks a new era for Lisk, and we can’t wait to see the results of what we are creating."

Lisk is one of the few historical projects that continues to thrive and was the first Layer 1 to evolve into a Layer 2. In December 2023, Lisk announced its migration to an Ethereum Layer 2 solution and became one of the earliest members of the OP Superchain alongside Optimism and Base, and followed more recently by significant projects like WorldChain (by WorldCoin), Soneium (by Sony), Unichain (by Uniswap), Ink (by Kraken), to name a few. This announcement comes on the heels of significant progress for Lisk. The network is poised for substantial growth and user engagement, with partnerships forged with major players such as:

* Circle: Launched the Circle Bridged USDC Standard, offering Lisk projects seamless access to USDC. This enhances both developer and user experiences, while reducing liquidity fragmentation across EVM blockchains and rollups.
* Rarible: Lisk NFTs are now available for live trading, with the initial mint launched at Coinfest Asia in September. The launch featured an exclusive airdrop from Indonesian artist Yahya Rifandaru.
* LayerZero: Enables seamless token transfers and omnichain application development across supported chains, enhancing interoperability within the Lisk ecosystem.
* Rainbow Wallet: Native integration of the Lisk network into the Rainbow Wallet app and browser extension allows automatic token balance detection, NFT indexing, DeFi position tracking, in-app swaps, and cross-chain asset bridging.
* Fireblocks: Lisk will be supported by Fireblocks for secure asset storage and transfer, ensuring institutional-grade security for token management and enterprise solutions.
* Velodrome: The leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on Optimism’s mainnet, Velodrome, is launching on Lisk from day one, aiming to enhance liquidity and leverage the existing Superchain ecosystem.

In addition to the above, Lisk has partnered with Angel Hack, Aya Labs, CV Labs, Key Difference Labs, and others to establish accelerator programs to support developers building real-world solutions in high-growth markets.

In September, the Optimism Foundation accepted Lisk’s grant proposal for 500,000 OP tokens to grow USD and non-USD-backed stablecoins on Lisk and the Superchain. The overall airdrop campaign boasts a budget of up to 15 million LSK tokens.
