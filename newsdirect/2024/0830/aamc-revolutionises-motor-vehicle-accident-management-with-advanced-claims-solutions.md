AAMC, a premier provider of motor vehicle accident management services, is setting a new standard in the industry with its innovative approach to Repair Management and in particular, Intermediated Motor Claims.

AAMC's founders, Steve Chapman and Simon Manolaros, identified gaps in the motor loss assessing market over two decades ago. The motor assessing industry was fragmented, with small, localised providers dominating the landscape. AAMC was born out of a desire to offer a more structured, consistent service, and today, they stand as a testament to operational excellence. Their experienced team of motor loss assessors and customer service representatives are committed to delivering top-tier outcomes for their clients, who represent the majority of the Australian motor insurance sector.

AAMC's latest innovation, the Intermediated Motor Team (IMT), represents a transformative approach to motor claims management. This unique framework is the first of its kind in Australia, designed to initiate expert intervention from the moment a motor incident occurs. By setting up the claim for success from Day Zero, IMT ensures a streamlined, efficient process that benefits all stakeholdersâ€”brokers, insurers, commercial customers, and supply chain managers alike.

The IMT framework takes charge of all accident management activities immediately after an incident. From triaging damage to facilitating communications, assisting with repair estimates, and beginning the assessment process, IMT provides a seamless claims experience. The focus on early intervention and proactive management means that claims progress quickly through the triage, booking, assessment and repair stages, reducing delays and ensuring that all parties are kept informed and satisfied.

The time between the initial incident and the lodgement of a claim is crucial. Policyholders can sometimes be left to navigate repairs and manage business interruptions on their own, with insurers unable to implement cost-saving strategies until much later in the claim cycle.

AAMC's IMT changes this dynamic by offering immediate support and guidance, allowing for meaningful cost control and a well-supported claims experience.

For brokers, the IMT model represents a significant enhancement to their insurance offerings. It enables them to provide a high-quality, best-practice claims capability, ensuring that their clients receive the support they need during a critical time.

This early intervention approach mitigates costs, identifies damage early, and engages with repairers and third parties proactively, resulting in a smoother, more efficient claims process and reduces the need for brokers or their clients to chase up insurers for updates, saving valuable time and resources.

The transparency provided by IMT ensures that all parties involved in a claim have clear visibility of its status and what to expect next.

By offering early expert intervention, IMT delivers a seamless, efficient claims process that benefits brokers, insurers, and clients alike, leading to higher satisfaction among all stakeholders.

AAMC's commitment to operational excellence and customer satisfaction continues to set them apart as leaders in the field.
