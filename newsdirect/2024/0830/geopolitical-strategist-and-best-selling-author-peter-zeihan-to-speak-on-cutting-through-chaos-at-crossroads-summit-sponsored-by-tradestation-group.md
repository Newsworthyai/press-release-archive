Tickets for the upcoming Crossroads Summit are still available for investors looking to navigate in a changing world.

World finance and international investment face unprecedented change. The disruptive potential of artificial intelligence (AI), the uncertainty of political and economic change and regional conflicts and a push toward decentralized cryptocurrencies present today’s investors with challenges.

However, they may also present investors with potential opportunities. The goal of the Crossroads Summit, sponsored by TradeStation Group, is to explore the chaos of a dynamic world and identify the innovations it fosters.

Zeihan To Put Geopolitical Chaos Into PerspectiveThis focus on global dynamics is why internationally renowned geopolitical strategist Peter Zeihan will be the keynote speaker on Day 1 of the November 2024 Crossroads Summit. His address is entitled Navigating the End of the World: Geopolitics and the Future of America.

Zeihan will illustrate how geography redefines global power, how demographics doom the current trade order and how America’s energy revolution has fundamentally shifted global realities from Russia to Iran to China.

The Crossroads Summit selected Zeihan – who has a background in private intelligence and is the bestselling author of four critically acclaimed books – because of his experience discussing the importance of leveraging world events into market forecasts.

Jon Horsman, the Former Chairman and CEO of Calgary, Canada-based AltaCorp Capital, said Zeihan’s “insights have significantly influenced my worldview, investments and business perspective.”

Horsman notes that when Zeihan speaks there is a purposeful provocation at work that drives thoughtful discussion. He is widely regarded as a global affairs expert and is a frequent contributor to major media outlets including newspapers and television news programs.

Zeihan’s clients have included JP Morgan Asset Management (NYSE: JPM), Blackstone (NYSE: BX), KPMG, Bank of Montreal, Raymond James & Associates (NYSE: RJF) and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. More information about Peter Zeihan is available on his company website.

Lineup Of Expert Speakers Round Out Two-Day EventAn integral component of the Crossroads Summit is to help participants cut through the chaos, embrace innovation and redefine their investing future. The first day of the event will focus on chaos and disruption and identify some of the trends that may impact investors.

Growing political instability, uncertainty over regulatory direction, immigration and government spending will be among the topics discussed. Other topics will include the consequences of expanded armed conflict in various regions around the world – namely Eastern Europe and the Middle East.

Day two of the event will focus on identifying investment themes that might thrive in a rapidly changing world. Potential topics might include the end of near-zero interest rates, persistent inflation and higher borrowing costs.

Panel discussions will include potential strategy shifts away from value investing toward growth and the growing importance of alternative investments like private credit, hedge funds and blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Technological advancements impacting productivity, like AI and robotics, will be key topics for discussion.
