# Brightberry Adds Lids to their Line of Non-Toxic Bowls for Infants

Brightberry, a trusted name in children's silicone tableware, is excited to unveil the latest update to its product line: spill-prevention lids to fit their non-toxic bowls designed specifically for infants.

The newly launched bowls are made from non-toxic silicone and certified Foods, Consumer Goods and Feedstuffs Code (LFGB), the highest standard. LFGB is generally viewed as the European FDA, though they’re far stricter on certifications – LFGB is required for companies operating in France and Germany. These LFGB non-toxic bowls and lids contain no BPA, PVC, lead, phthalates, or any other toxins.

Brightberry’s products are crafted from premium, food-grade silicone, free from harmful chemicals such as BPA, phthalates, and PVC. With growing concerns over the safety of children's products, Brightberry has taken a proactive approach to ensure their products exceed safety standards, offering peace of mind to parents everywhere.

These bowls feature a unique suction base that securely adheres to most surfaces, significantly reducing the likelihood of spills and accidents during mealtime. The bowls are designed with practicality in mind; they are dishwasher-safe for easy cleaning and microwave-safe for convenient reheating. Available in a range of vibrant colors, the bowls add a fun element to feeding time while supporting developmental milestones such as self-feeding.

"We understand the importance of providing products that are both safe and functional," says the team at Brightberry. "Our new line of non-toxic bowls not only meets the highest safety standards but also incorporates thoughtful design elements that make feeding easier and more enjoyable for both parents and children."

This product launch represents Brightberry's dedication to innovation and customer satisfaction. The company regularly updates its product lines based on customer feedback and emerging market trends. By combining safety, durability, and aesthetic appeal, Brightberry continues to set the standard for excellence in children's tableware.

Brightberry's new line of non-toxic bowls for infants is now available for purchase through their website and at select retail partners. The company invites parents and caregivers to explore this latest offering and experience the difference that quality design and materials can make.
