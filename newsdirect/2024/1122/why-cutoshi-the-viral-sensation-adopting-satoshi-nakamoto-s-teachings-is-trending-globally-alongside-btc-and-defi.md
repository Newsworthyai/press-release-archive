As Cutoshi trends on X for the second time this month, Bitcoin also trends as it hits fresh all-time highs of $98,300.

Why Is Cutoshi Trending?On November 20th, Cutoshi’s native token $CUTO hit the number one trending spot on X, with BTC and DeFi. As the coin makes it to the top spot of X for the second time this month.

The team has many inspirations and that’s the work and ethics of Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi stood for privacy, decentralization and financial autonomy and that’s exactly what Cutoshi is giving to people.

So What Will DeFi Look Like With Cutoshi?Cutoshi’s plan is to leverage the mass appeal of memes to bring new people into the fold of crypto investing, trading, DeFi and the Cutoshi ecosystem. The next step is to make DeFi fun and easy to use. Currently, over 2000 community members are participating in token farming, which will result in airdrops, a big part of DeFi over the last few years.

After that comes the Cutoshi DEX, currently in development. This will be easy to use, especially due to its cross-chain capabilities. This is important since bridging across blockchains can be daunting and risky, even for those competent in DeFi.

The DEX will also offer peer-to-peer trading for true anonymity, another important part of the ethos of Nakamoto. Other features will include the possibility to stake and provide liquidity, essential features for decentralized exchanges, which rely on automated market makers and liquidity pools rather than CEXs order book styles.

What Good Is All Of That If People Don’t Understand How To Get Involved? That is the question that prompted the Cutoshi team to start creating an education platform. Keeping with the meme style of Cutoshi, this will be fun and easy to learn with, to encourage people to get involved whatever their experience or skill levels.

Early community members are in line to be eligible for a limited edition set of NFTs that will be beautiful but also functional, providing DeFi-based utility within the ecosystem.

What’s Next For The Project?In the short term, Cutoshi has its sights set on $1 million in funds raised in the presale. With approximately $65k to go before this milestone is hit.

Cutoshi will continue to raise funds and build the DeFi ecosystem while the price increases throughout the presale. They will continue their marketing efforts as the project and community build hype.

The project is then set to launch on a DEX and later on a tier 1 CEX. If previous meme coins that have DeFi functionalities (e.g. SHIB) are anything to go by, this could be a presale that brings massive gains.
