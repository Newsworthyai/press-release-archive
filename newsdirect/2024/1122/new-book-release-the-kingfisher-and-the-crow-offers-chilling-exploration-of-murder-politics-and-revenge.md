# New Book Release: "The Kingfisher and the Crow” Offers Chilling Exploration of Murder, Politics, and Revenge

In the wake of the contentious national election, debut thriller “The Kingfisher and the Crow” offers a chilling exploration of ambition, revenge, and the dark side of power.

“The Kingfisher and the Crow” follows freshman Congressman Jerry Sharpe's insidious campaign to destroy Mildred Hawthorne, the matriarch of one of the nation's most powerful families. Sharpe's plan starts with the gruesome murder of Hawthorne's firstborn, then quickly escalates into a brutal double homicide of the family's remaining siblings. Each murder brings Sharpe closer to his goal—making the Hawthorne matriarch suffer as he did nearly 30 years ago when he found his mother lifeless in the bathtub.

Disgraced reporter Skylar Nicholson, crime correspondent for “The Thread,” a digital newspaper in the beltway, catches the scent of Sharpe's intentions. The story of a congressman on a murderous rampage could capture the city's imagination and save her career. Is diving into the middle of this violent family feud worth the risk?

In a confrontation where one party is blinded by revenge and the other clutches to secrets about identity and a life never lived, the final battle is destined to inflict maximum damage.

"It is fast-paced and moves flawlessly through a multitude of scenes with some interesting characters that are well etched into their background stories, along with a few twists and surprises that keep you turning pages until you realize there is no chance for a full night's sleep," said JJ Partridge, Rhode Island author of the Algy Temple murder mysteries and “Under Blood Moons.”

TIM DIAZ is the Executive Director of Meals on Wheels of Rockingham County in southeastern New Hampshire. A former executive in the footwear, apparel, and craft beer businesses, Diaz's passion for writing has led him to this thrilling debut novel.

PETER MARINO is the CEO of Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island, a seasoned political strategist with decades of experience working with elected officials. His insights into the world of power and politics inform the intricate plot of “The Kingfisher and the Crow.”

The book is available for purchase in paperback, hard cover, and e-book on the book’s website, Amazon, and at Barnes & Noble bookstores.
