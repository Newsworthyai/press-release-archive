Designed for investors keen on exploring Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and real estate management and development markets, XLRE offers a focused strategy that includes key sectors like Industrial, Data Center, and Telecommunications.

Portfolio and Holdings*

The fund currently maintains a portfolio of 31 stocks dedicating a substantial share—more than 60%—to its top ten holdings. This allocation strategy demonstrates XLRE's approach to maintaining a focused portfolio of real estate investments.

Transparency and Reporting

XLRE prides itself on transparency, offering daily reporting on portfolio holdings and allocations. This practice allows investors to have a clear and up-to-date understanding of where their funds are invested.

S&P 500 Component Companies

By including only S&P 500 component companies, XLRE ensures that its portfolio is primarily comprised of large-cap names in the real estate sector. This alignment offers investors a predictable and reliable pathway for real estate investment.

DISCLOSURES

The S&P 500 Index is an unmanaged index of 500 common stocks that is generally considered representative of the U.S. stock market. The index is heavily weighted toward stocks with large market capitalizations and represents approximately two-thirds of the total market value of all domestic common stocks. The S&P 500 Index figures do not reflect any fees, expenses or taxes. An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, fees and expenses before investing.

One may not invest directly in an index.

Transparent ETFs provide daily disclosure of portfolio holdings and weightings

All ETFs are subject to risk, including loss of principal. Sector ETF products are also subject to sector risk and nondiversification risk, which generally will result in greater price fluctuations than the overall market. Diversification does not eliminate risk.

An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. To obtain a prospectus, which contains this and other information, call 1-866-SECTOR-ETF (732-8673) or visit www.sectorspdrs.com. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
