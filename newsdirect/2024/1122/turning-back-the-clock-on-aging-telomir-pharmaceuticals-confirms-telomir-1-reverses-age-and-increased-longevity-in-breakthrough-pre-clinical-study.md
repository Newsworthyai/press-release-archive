Turning back the clock on aging is the holy grail for the longevity industry, but is something that has proven elusive. That may be changing, thanks to companies like Telomir Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: TELO). The pre-clinical-stage company positioning itself as an emerging leader in age-reversal science is making inroads with Telomir-1, a compound designed to effectively turn back the biological clock and support longevity. Results from a preclinical trial confirmed the efficacy of the compound, reports Telomir.

Using advanced in vivo microfluidic technology, in collaboration with Nagi Biosciences SA, the study demonstrated what Telomir said is significant age-reversal effects in aging model organisms treated with Telomir-1. These effects include an extended healthy lifespan, improved mobility and a measurable reversal of age-related decline.

“The results we’re seeing with Telomir-1 mark an important step forward in our journey to potentially reverse aging in humans,” said Erez Aminov, Chairman and CEO of Telomir Pharmaceuticals in a press release announcing the trial results. “This study confirms that Telomir-1 can reverse biological aging, extending life while preserving health. We are very excited about the potential applications of Telomir-1 as we progress toward human clinical trials”

Anti-Aging In A Compound Telomir-1 is focused on telomere regeneration which involves repairing telomeres or the DNA structures that protect the ends of our chromosomes, similar to caps on shoelaces. Numerous studies have shown fixing them can extend a person’s biological age and even turn back the clock on certain diseases.

Telomir Pharmaceuticals says Telomir-1 is a novel small molecule to lengthen the DNA’s protective telomere caps in order to potentially reverse age-related conditions. The novel molecule, which Telomir is testing with mice and dogs with an eye toward human clinical trials, binds to critical metals that wear down telomeres. By limiting the availability of metals and interrupting the enzyme function, Telomir-1 seeks to restore cellular metal homeostasis and reverse a person's or animal’s biological age. The non-toxic oral therapy provides what the company says is a safe and effective alternative to existing treatments with minimal side effects. Telomir says Telomir-1 has the potential to impact patient care by offering new hope for managing and reversing age-related diseases and improving the quality of life for aging individuals.

The Study DetailsThe preclinical study, conducted in collaboration with Nagi Bioscience, utilized a sophisticated in vivo microfluidic-based assay to assess the effects of Telomir-1 on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a well-established model for aging studies, reports Telomir. The microfluidic platform allowed precise, automated tracking of lifespan, healthspan and age-related mobility decline in real-time, enabling the research team to accurately measure the effects of Telomir-1 on these critical metrics.

Two forms of Telomir-1 were administered in two concentrations. The study found that Telomir-1 significantly enhanced lifespan and healthspan parameters in aged microorganism populations. Some of the key findings include enhanced mobility in older organisms, reduced biological aging and increased lifespan. Subjects treated with Telomir-1 showed improved mobility, particularly in later stages of life compared to untreated controls. Telomir also said the study demonstrated “a measurable” reversal of biological age markers which the company said makes it a promising candidate for longevity treatments. What’s more, the company said Telomir-1 was associated with a statistically significant increase in lifespan among treated populations, further supporting Telomir-1’s role in promoting longevity.

"At Nagi Bioscience, we are thrilled to contribute to this groundbreaking study through our innovative microfluidic technology, which allows precise and automated monitoring of aging and healthspan metrics in real-time,” said Dr. Laurent Mouchiroud, Chief Scientific Officer at Nagi Bioscience. “These results highlight Telomir-1’s remarkable potential to improve longevity and health, showcasing the power of cutting-edge tools in advancing age-reversal science."

Expanding Telomir-1’s Reach Telomir sees many market opportunities for Telomir-1. There’s the longevity and anti-senescence therapy market, which is valued at $27.11 billion and is projected to reach $44.92 billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 6.8%. Then there’s Alzheimer's. Nearly seven million Americans suffer from this disease that attacks memory and cognitive functions. By 2050 that’s forecast to reach close to 13 million. And let's not forget cancer, another area Telomir-1 could prove effective in fighting. The global oncology market size is projected to reach $521.60 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 8.9% from now until then.

An additional area where Telomir-1 may help is in the treatment of progeria, a rare genetic disorder that causes accelerated aging in children. Telomir is intensifying its focus on the potential use of Telomir-1 to treat progeria and has engaged with the Progeria Foundation to investigate the effects of Telomir-1 on human progeria cell lines. This study will directly assess Telomir-1’s ability to counteract accelerated aging at the cellular level, offering critical insights into its therapeutic potential for progeria patients.

Telomir also planned an in vivo study utilizing a progeria Caenorhabditis elegans model. This advanced microfluidic-based assay will evaluate Telomir-1’s impact on longevity, healthspan and biological aging in an organismal context. Telomir said these two studies represent a comprehensive approach to understanding Telomir-1’s effects on progeria, targeting both cellular and whole-organism models of the disease.

On the canine front, Telomir is in talks with the North Carolina State College of Veterinary Medicine to establish a large-scale study on elderly dogs with osteoarthritis, further exploring Telomir-1’s potential to improve joint health and mobility.

Turning back the clock on aging is the quest of many companies. Telomir believes it's getting closer to the successful formula. With the company all in with Telomir-1, stay tuned for more news on the trial front from this early-stage anti-aging innovator.
