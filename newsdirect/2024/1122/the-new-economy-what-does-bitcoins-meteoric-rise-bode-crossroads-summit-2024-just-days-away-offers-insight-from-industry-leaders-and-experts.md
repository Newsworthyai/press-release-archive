Nearly 16 years have passed since the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto mined Bitcoin’s genesis block on Jan. 3, 2009, launching what would become the largest and most popular cryptocurrency. Originally conceived as a decentralized alternative to traditional currencies, Bitcoin has undergone rapid growth and become a significant store of value, substantially altering the financial landscape.

With Bitcoin soaring to new heights in November, the upcoming Crossroads Summit brings together experts in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space to discuss the future of Bitcoin and the rise of alternative hard assets.

Experts Weigh In On The Future Of Digital AssetsBitcoin hit an all-time high of slightly over $90,000 on Nov. 12, following a 35% surge sparked by President-elect Donald Trump’s election victory a week earlier. Trump’s White House return is considered bullish for the cryptocurrency industry, with the president-elect having indicated that he will implement favorable regulations.

Cryptocurrencies have staged a remarkable recovery in the last two years. Bitcoin fell close to $15,000 in November 2022 after the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the demise of its founder and CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, with far-reaching consequences for the cryptocurrency industry.

With Bitcoin now trading at record levels, many analysts are projecting that it could hit $100,000 before the end of the year. Among them, is Chris Sullivan, co-founder and portfolio manager of Hyperion Decimus and one of the speakers at this month’s Crossroads Summit, to be held on Nov. 21 and 22 in Miami, Florida. Sullivan and other cryptocurrency experts will be speaking at a panel discussion on the second day of the conference titled “The New Economy: Bitcoin and the Rise of Alternative Hard Assets.”

A recognized expert in cryptocurrency investments and fintech, Sullivan’s fascination with cryptocurrency's decentralization possibilities compelled him to found Hyperion Decimus, a quant-driven diversified digital asset management firm with a mission to bring digital assets to the masses. Through its Libertas Fund, Hyperion Decimus trades over $1 billion a month in cryptocurrency and, according to Sullivan, has significantly outperformed the individual digital assets it trades.

Sullivan sees Bitcoin reaching $225,000 in the long term due to a confluence of factors, including a global surge of interest once it passes the $100,000 mark and a potential shift toward commodities and digital assets.

Growing Institutional Interest In Digital AssetsOnce often viewed with skepticism and associated with illicit activities, digital currencies are increasingly being adopted by big banks and institutions thanks to the adoption of regulatory frameworks and high-profile endorsements.

In June 2023, Blackrock and Fidelity filed SEC applications for Bitcoin spot ETPs, which were eventually approved in January 2024, along with other funds. Now there are some 36 Bitcoin ETPs traded on the U.S. markets.

Major financial institutions such as JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) have also started offering Bitcoin services, while Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA) have made progress in enabling cryptocurrency payments, helping to close the gap between cryptocurrencies and traditional finance.

Amid this backdrop in the institutional landscape, another key speaker at the Crossroads Summit will be Eduardo Abreu, New Business vice president at Visa. Abreu, who also has prior experience as a business development director at Mastercard, is likely to bring valuable insights into the role of Visa and Mastercard in the new digital economy and how large financial institutions are navigating the change.

Traditional Finance Meets Emerging TechnologiesJoining Chris Sullivan and Eduardo Abreu at the Crossroads Summit are two seasoned professionals from the finance and technology sectors – John Divine and Maja Vujinovic.

Divine handles Digital Asset OTC Trading at Blockfills. As a financial markets professional focused on structured products, derivatives, lending, borrowing and spot market execution for digital assets, he intends to bring deep insights into the impact of market dynamics on the trajectory of Bitcoin as adoption grows among both investors and traders. He recently predicted that BTC will reach $150,000 by the end of the year.

Vujinovic, meanwhile, is a business operator and an investor in business transformation tools (AI, blockchain). Vujinovic was an early pioneer in the mobile payment industry, having acquired $700 million in assets across Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. She was also an early pioneer of Bitcoin and blockchain technology.

Currently, she is the managing director of OGroup, which focuses on the intersection of legacy systems and technologies such as artificial intelligence, automation systems, blockchain and the internet of things. With her vast experience, Vujinovic’s insights are likely to cover a broad range of topics relating to tech and innovation, particularly the integration of digital assets into legacy systems.
