# Current Client Wins “Best in Show” at the XYPN LIVE AdviceTech Competition

XY Planning Network (XYPN), the nation’s leading support platform for independent, fee-only financial planners, recently announced the winners of its annual XYPN LIVE AdviceTech Competition, marking the first time in nine years that organizers expanded the competition’s scope to include any technology supporting Financial “Advicers” in serving clients, running more efficient and profitable practices, or growing their reach.

Of the six finalists, the expert panel of judges selected Current Client, a compliant texting solution for advisors, as the “Best in Show” winner. Audience members selected Quivr CRM, a Salesforce overlay for comprehensive financial planners, as its “Advicer’s Choice.”

Winners were named at last month’s XYPN LIVE conference, where the six finalists delivered seven-minute, pitch-style presentations. The expert panel of judges included XYPN Chairman Michael Kitces; Craig Iskowitz, founder and CEO of Ezra Group; Justin Wisz, founder and investor of Thicket Ventures; and Rachel Witkowski, former Tech/AI reporter at Financial Planning. The judges selected the winner based on a blind voting process.

“XYPN has been at the forefront of fee-for-service planning since we were founded 10 years ago,” Kitces said. “We knew that supporting new business models in financial planning to serve new clientele meant also supporting new technology that didn’t yet exist in the industry. We founded our AdviceTech competition specifically to help create a space for new up-and-coming tech vendors to get seen and noticed by our XYPN membership for the AdviceTech they’re building.”

Having recently marked its 10-year anniversary, XYPN is committed to finding new ways to support financial planners, and highlighting innovative technology companies is an important component of that goal. Since the competition’s inception, nearly 150 companies have applied for an opportunity to debut their tech solutions at XYPN LIVE.

To qualify for the competition, contestants needed to meet one or more of the following criteria: launched in the past 12 months, have less than $1 million in revenue or be an existing company with a new offering that is substantively different from its existing solutions and independently priced.

Over the past eight years, prior winners have grown far beyond the startup phase, becoming category leaders. Previous “Best in Show” winners include Snappy Kraken, Vestwell, Holistiplan and Income Lab.

In addition to Current Client and Quivr CRM, the four finalists were FinMate AI, an AI notetaker designed by financial advisors for financial advisors; Trayecto, a financial planning platform designed to address how modern workers earn and allocate money; JumpAI, a fully compliant and secure AI notetaker and task manager; and Testimonial iQ, which unlocks previously inaccessible marketing tools for financial advisors, including gathering and sharing critical third-party validation.

The AdviceTech ”Best in Show” winner received a package of prizes, including a free exhibition at XYPN LIVE 2025, coaching calls with competition judges, bragging rights, and promotion within various XYPN marketing channels. The “Advicer’s Choice” earned bragging rights, along with a free webinar and promotional opportunities.
