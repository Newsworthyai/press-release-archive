This range is particularly beneficial for companies working on traditional and heritage buildings, as the cast iron gutters combine durability with a classic design. The cast iron systems are rust-resistant and designed to preserve the architectural integrity of period properties while offering modern functionality.

In addition to cast iron, the company’s aluminium guttering products provide an eco-friendly option.
