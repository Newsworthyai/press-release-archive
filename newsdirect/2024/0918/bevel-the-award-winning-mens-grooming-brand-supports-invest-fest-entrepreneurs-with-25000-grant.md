Atlanta-based, leading men’s head-to-toe grooming brand Bevel, is proud to present a $25,000 business grant to marketplace vendor Double Dutch Aerobics. Invest Fest is a first of its kind, in-person experience that combines investing, entrepreneurship, pop culture, and entertainment in a festival setting. The festival is where commerce and culture meet at a unique intersection for the empowerment of our community. Bevel is proud to support the community and this innovative fitness program.

As the official grooming partner of the 4th annual Invest Fest, Bevel, selected the pioneering fitness business Double Dutch Aerobics, founded by Double Dutch World Champion Michelle Clark and Sean Clark, Master Double Dutch Aerobics Instructor, from over 300+ conference vendors. Double Dutch Aerobics, is also based in Atlanta, Georgia.

Founded in 2013 by Tristan Walker, an entrepreneur who identified a need in shaving products and tools for himself and other men like him, Bevel was born from Black entrepreneurship and ingenuity. A decade later, Bevel has revolutionized grooming industry standards and offers a range of premium hair, beard, shave, skin, and body care products that prioritize the needs of Black and brown men. Furthermore, the Atlanta-based brand remains committed to looking for opportunities to best serve its customer and its community.

Bevel CEO, Damon Frost, announced the grant donation on the Monday, September 9th, 2024 episode of Earn Your Leisure’s Market Mondays Podcast. Under the Earn Your Leisure Network, Invest Fest is a premier event focused on financial empowerment and entrepreneurialism. Held on August 23rd – 25th 2024 in the Georgia World Conference Centre, the conference included presentations, panels and workshops on investing, entrepreneurship, pop culture and entertainment. The festival-style event enables attendees to network with industry trailblazers, connect with other business owners and even pitch their business ideas for grants. Headquartered in Atlanta, Bevel’s partnership with Invest Fest is a continuation of the brand’s track record of serving its customer and its community through giveback initiatives. The 3-day conference equips many in the community with tools to grow and expand their financial wellness and entrepreneurial ventures.

“At Bevel, we are committed to serving our customers with product solutions to address their unique grooming needs and through giveback initiatives that we believe make a real impact in the community,” said Bevel Marketing Leader Breann Davis. “We are grateful to Rashad, Troy and the entire Invest Team for allowing us to partner with amazing companies like Double Dutch Aerobics and elevate the next generation of entrepreneurs who share our commitment to the community.”
