# TeamWorking by TechNexus becomes largest coworking space in Chicago after expansion at historic Civic Opera Building

TeamWorking by TechNexus, a shared workspace located in Chicago, is now the city’s largest coworking space as a result of a multi-floor expansion at the historic Civic Opera Building.

TeamWorking now operates 100,000+ square feet of suites, offices, and event space at 20 N. Wacker Dr. after entering into a management partnership agreement with the building. JLL represented TeamWorking in the expansion, which now makes TeamWorking Chicago’s largest single coworking location.

In addition to office space, the location offers a rooftop terrace, fitness center, podcast studio and full editing suite, stocked kitchens, wellness room and more. Additional amenities include meeting space for up to 175 guests. Top brands like McDonald’s, Airbnb and more turn to TeamWorking to host their events.

TeamWorking’s focus on collaboration, network building, and community connection have created a space for Chicago’s most innovative organizations to grow, collaborate and thrive.”

Beyond TeamWorking becoming the largest coworking space in Chicago, this transaction represents one of the larger transactions completed across the West Loop, and signifies trending momentum for coworking, hybrid office space that fits what many entrepreneurs, innovators and startup organizations are seeking as they build and scale their organization, according to JLL.

“TeamWorking’s expansion represents surging momentum and growth across Chicago’s downtown office landscape as more organizations are seeking desirable amenities and collaborative office spaces to fuel their growth,” noted JLL’s Deanna Becker, Executive Vice President.
