The Hispanic Motor Press jury panel reveals its selection of vehicle finalists for the 2025 Hispanic Motor Press Awards (HMPA). The top three selections by category were based on key automotive purchase drivers for Hispanic consumers. Presented this year by leading car care brand Meguiar’s, the 15th annual HMPA jury panel evaluated more than two hundred vehicles, testing the advancements in technology, safety features, infotainment, and cleaner mobility solutions. The winners will be announced on November 21 at the main stage during the LA Auto Show – AutoMobility LA.

“Automotive sales momentum is largely determined today by the Hispanic consumers, who represent 1 in 4 new vehicle purchases,” shares Ricardo Rodriguez-Long, a veteran automotive journalist and founder of the Hispanic Motor Press. With the continuous evolution of safety and tech features, we help guide Hispanic car buyers while empowering them with information on adopting clean and safe transportation that enhances their vehicle experience.”

Joining HMPA this year is Meguiar’s, supporting car culture since 1901 and recognizing the importance of the Hispanic segment in the country’s economy. Their car care products have been used throughout Latin America for over a hundred years and have been an integral part of the Los Angeles car culture.
