# Post-Election Cancellations in DC’s Inauguration Rentals Reflect Voter Sentiment

Great Dwellings, a prominent short-term rental (STR) management firm in Washington, DC, has released data on cancellations and re-bookings for Inauguration Day stays following the recent election of President Donald Trump.

“Leading up to Election Day, 100% of our properties were booked for the inauguration,” stated Jon Rosen, President of Great Dwellings. “However, within 24 hours after the election was called for Trump, 57% of these reservations were cancelled, indicating that optimism for a Harris victory may have been stronger than the voting results suggested. Harris’s popular vote share, according to the Associated Press, was 49.5%.”

In the days following these cancellations, more than a third of the vacant spots have been re-booked by Trump supporters eager to attend the January 20 event. Rosen notes, “We anticipate filling all properties well before Inauguration Day.”

Inauguration years traditionally see strong demand for short-term rentals, with many groups booking both to attend and celebrate the event. Nightly rates for these dates are typically three times the regular rate due to high demand. Reservations are made by supporters of both major candidates, often placing bets that their candidate will win. A smaller segment of renters simply seeks to witness this historic event, regardless of the victor.

When cancellation and booking patterns diverge from polling expectations, they often reflect varying confidence levels or the significance voters attribute to the candidates.
