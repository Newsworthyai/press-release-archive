# IB2 lands a major investment from Glencore to fuel aluminium’s sustainable shift

IB2, the French company co-founded by Yves Occello and Romain Girbal, has announced that it managed to secure a total of 100 million euro investment in the last 12 months to further develop its innovative process for producing more sustainable alumina. This investment marks a decisive step for IB2 and confirms its pioneering role in the ecological transformation of the traditionally energy-intensive aluminum sector.

The financing was secured from a group of financial and industrial investors including Glencore and several private backers. This alliance will provide IB2 with additional resources to deploy its process on an international scale.

Robin Scheiner, Head of Glencore's aluminum business, welcomes the investment: "As the demand for bauxite and alumina continues to grow, we believe IB2’s technology has the potential to play a role in meeting the aluminium industry needs in a sustainable way”.

For Romain Girbal, the €100 million raised provides the means to accelerate and strengthen IB2's market position. The French co-founder adds: "Having Glencore on our side will also allow us to accelerate the deployment of our technology on a global scale.”

The IB2 process is a technological innovation that transforms low-grade bauxite into high-grade ore, optimizing alumina production while reducing the sector's environmental footprint. The process reduces the production of red mud by 67% and the use of water and caustic soda by more than 80%, while producing an environmentally friendly by-product, tobermorite, which is used in the production of a new generation of green cement. This technology is the first major innovation in this heavy industry sector in over 50 years.

With this spectacular €100 million investment, IB2 is now a key player in the environmental transformation of the aluminum industry, consolidating its position as a leader in this crucial change.
