# SPARK Microsystems Redefines Wireless Gaming with New 8K Mouse Reference Design

SPARK Microsystems, a Canadian fabless semiconductor company specializing in next-generation short-range wireless communications, today announced the release of its 8K gaming mouse reference design, supporting polling rates up to 8,000 Hz. Built for high-performance gaming and esports, this new design harnesses SPARK’s SR1020 ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless transceiver, offering a wireless gaming experience that matches the performance of wired solutions.

The 8K mouse reference design is specifically engineered to meet the needs of competitive gamers, offering the seamless, high-speed responsiveness typically associated with wired mice. SPARK’s UWB technology delivers ultra-low latency of 0.2 ms and remarkably low power consumption – 30% or more lower than 2.4 GHz gaming mice at 8,000 Hz. SPARK’s technology outperforms traditional wireless standards by avoiding interference with the congested 2.4 GHz spectrum, ensuring an uninterrupted gaming experience free from the lag and delays often found in traditional wireless solutions.

“Our focus at SPARK is on delivering practical innovations in short-range wireless communications, making it faster, more efficient, and seamlessly responsive" said Dr. Abdul Hafiz Alameh, PhD, Director of Product Marketing, SPARK Microsystems. "Our 8K mouse reference design, powered by the SR1020 UWB transceiver, provides industry-leading performance —offering a gaming experience indistinguishable from wired solutions.”

Key features of SPARK’s 8K gaming mouse reference design include:

* Polling Rate: Unmatched smoothness and responsiveness with configurable polling rates up to 8 kHz.
* Ultra-Low Latency: Latency of 0.2 ms ensures a real-time response indistinguishable from wired solutions.
* Low Power Operation: Significantly reduced power consumption for extended battery life and smaller battery sizes.
* Low Interference: Operates outside congested frequency bands, avoiding the performance bottlenecks of traditional wireless systems.

The new 8K gaming mouse reference design showcases the SR1020 UWB transceiver’s advanced capabilities, allowing for sustained high data rates while consuming minimal power. Gamers benefit from longer battery life and lighter, more agile designs, all without sacrificing performance. The design is part of SPARK’s growing ecosystem of reference designs, aimed at enhancing wireless capabilities in gaming, consumer electronics, and IoT markets.
