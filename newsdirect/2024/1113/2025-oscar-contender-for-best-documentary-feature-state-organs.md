# 2025 OSCAR CONTENDER FOR BEST DOCUMENTARY FEATURE STATE ORGANS

ThriveNewsWire / State Organs – The award-winning documentary State Organs will have a week-long theater run starting on Nov. 15. State Organs: Unmasking Transplant Abuse in China (aka State Organs) has entered the list of potential contenders for the 97th Academy Awards in the category of Best Documentary Feature.

Screening Details:

Dates: Nov. 15–21

Showtimes: 1 PM, 3 PM, 5 PM, 7 PM, and 9 PM

Location: Cinema Village, 22 East 12th Street, New York, NY 10003

Skillfully directed by Peabody Award winner Raymond Zhang, this powerful documentary follows two Chinese families in their 20-year search for loved ones who disappeared in police custody in China. Their search reveals a harrowing government-run organ harvesting operation that has devastated thousands of lives—a practice that continues to this day.

The screenings at 7 PM on Friday and Saturday will be followed by a live Q&A session with representatives from Stop Forced Organ Harvesting (SFOH), the event sponsor, as well as family members of the victims of forced organ harvesting. This session offers an invaluable opportunity for audience members to engage in direct dialogue about the film’s content and its broader human rights implications.

We encourage your attendance at this event to help bring attention to these critical human rights issues. Your coverage would greatly contribute to fostering a deeper understanding and discussion within our community.
