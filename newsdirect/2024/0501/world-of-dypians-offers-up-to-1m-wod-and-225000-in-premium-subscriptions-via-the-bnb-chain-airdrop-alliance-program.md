The metaverse platform announced it offers up to 1,000,000 WOD tokens and $225,000 in Premium Subscriptions as rewards for eligible users across all its 4 campaigns, which are spread across May and June.

What is the Airdrop Alliance Program on the BNB Chain?

BNB Chain has started the Airdrop Alliance Program in collaboration with handpicked, high-profile projects to conduct airdrops for retroactive users on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and its parallel chain, opBNB. The program aims to connect top projects that have yet to issue tokens with the broad BNB Chain community, which has the opportunity to earn more rewards by participating in these projects' campaigns.

The first chapter of the Airdrop Alliance Program concluded in April and saw the distribution of 6.1 billion points and 6.9 million tokens to the BNB Chain community. The organizers estimate that over 500,000 users have participated in the event so far. Moreover, their ranks are bound to grow during the second chapter, increasing the overall value of rewards.

In BNB's announcement The BNB Chain Core Development Team stated: “The second chapter of the Airdrop Alliance has a core objective of enhancing community engagement and expressing gratitude to the BNB Chain community for their support towards BSC and opBNB. After the success of the first batch, we look forward to working with leading ecosystem projects to launch chapter 2."

BNB Chain recently announced the start of the second chapter of its Airdrop Alliance Program with the eligibility criteria:

* Level 1: Users must migrate at least 1 BNB from the Beacon Chain to BSC using this Stake Migration tool or stake at least 1 BNB on BSC. Only a snapshot taken on May 15, 2024, at 00:00 UTC, will be considered valid.
* Level 2: Stake at least 5 BNB on BSC. Similarly, the snapshot should be May 15, 2024, at 00:00 UTC.
