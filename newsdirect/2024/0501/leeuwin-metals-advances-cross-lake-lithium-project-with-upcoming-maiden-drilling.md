# Leeuwin Metals advances Cross Lake Lithium Project with upcoming maiden drilling

--News Direct--

Leeuwin Metals Ltd (ASX:LM1) joins Proactive’s Jonathan Jackson to discuss the progress in its operations during the last quarter and what’s to come, particularly highlighting the Cross Lake Lithium Project in Manitoba, Canada. Piggott emphasises the advancement of this project, where 4.7 kilometres of lithium-rich pegmatites have been identified and sampled, showcasing the site's potential for a large-scale lithium operation. The company is poised to start its maiden drilling program at Cross Lake, with plans to drill a 2,500-metre phase-1 program targeting multiple high-grade spodumene-bearing pegmatites. This will be the first significant exploration in the area in over 40 years, focusing on known high-grade intercepts and aiming to explore both shallow mineralisation and down dip extents with hole depths ranging from 50 to 200 metres. In addition to Cross Lake, Leeuwin Metals is reviewing work at the William Lake Nickel Project in Manitoba, exploring for nickel and platinum group elements (PGE). This review aims to guide further exploration and identify additional PGE opportunities. In Western Australia, Leeuwin started field activities in early 2024, with soil sampling revealing a promising 9.5-kilometre rare earth elements (REE) anomaly in the Gascoyne region. The company has conducted further mapping and sampling, with assay results pending, and continues to explore additional tenure opportunities in this region. Leeuwin Metals maintains a robust cash position and a focused exploration team, both crucial as they advance these critical metals projects in Canada and Australia. The upcoming summer season's activities, including detailed mapping and geochemical sampling, are anticipated to further underscore the exploration potential across its diverse portfolio.
