# Botala Energy makes significant Serowe advancements on path to commercial development

--News Direct--

Botala Energy Ltd (ASX:BTE) non-executive director Peter Grant sits down with Proactive’s Jonathan Jackson to discuss several milestones passed during the March quarter including the receipt of environmental approval for the commercial development of its Serowe Coal Bed Methane (CBM) project, known as Project Pitse, in Botswana. This marks a significant step in transitioning the project from exploration to production, allowing for the construction of around 100 kilometres of pipeline linking the wellfield to the upcoming Leupane Energy Hub and Industrial Park near Palapye. The company has completed a coring program at the S3-4 well under Project Pitse and has initiated desorption testing of the cores to ascertain the gas content of the coal seams. The outcomes of these tests are crucial as they will help refine resource estimates and enhance the feasibility of the project. Additionally, Botala Energy has completed a geophysical survey aimed at optimally locating three new exploration wells. These wells are planned for drilling in the next two quarters and will explore coal seams to the south and east of Project Pitse, potentially expanding the operational area and increasing the resource base. Grant highlights that these developments significantly de-risk the project and strengthen the company’s position with potential partners. He emphasized Botala Energy’s commitment to sustainable energy development in line with global standards. Looking ahead, Botala Energy remains focused on advancing its flagship Serowe CBM Project along with its renewable energy initiatives. The company has also provided updates on gas desorption testing and technical mapping subsequent to the previous quarter's achievements.
