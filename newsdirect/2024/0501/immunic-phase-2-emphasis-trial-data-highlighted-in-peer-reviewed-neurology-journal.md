# Immunic Phase 2 EMPhASIS trial data highlighted in peer-reviewed neurology journal

--News Direct--

Immunic Inc (NASDAQ:IMUX) CEO Dr Daniel Vitt joined Proactive's Stephen Gunnion with news of the publication of extended data from the Phase 2 EMPhASIS trial of vidofludimus calcium in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in the peer-reviewed journal, NeurologyÂ® Neuroimmunology & Neuroinflammation, an official journal of the American Academy of Neurology.

Vitt noted that the EMPhASIS trial demonstrated a notable reduction in gadolinium-enhancing lesions by 78% and 74% in two high-dose groups compared with the placebo. These results also correlate with improvements in serum neurofilament light chain levels, consistent with recent interim phase 2 clinical data from the ongoing CALLIPER trial in progressive MS, indicating ongoing progress in the field.

Vitt highlighted the study's contribution to understanding the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of the treatment under investigation. The drug's potential impact on the treatment landscape of MS, particularly its role in addressing disease progression independent of relapse activity, was emphasized.

Immunic is also conducting the CALLIPER trial in progressive MS, with key results expected by April 2025. Additionally, the phase 3 ENSURE trials are actively enrolling, with projected readouts in 2026.

Dr Vitt expressed optimism about the drug's unique profile, combining safety and effectiveness in potentially altering the management of all forms of MS.
