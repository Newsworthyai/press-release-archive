# Bandcamp’s 47 Million Fans Celebrate the 40th Bandcamp Friday with 100% of Sales Revenue Going to its 5 Million Artists

--News Direct--

Bandcamp, the world’s largest super fan platform supporting artists, is celebrating its 40th Bandcamp Friday On May 3rd 2024, an industry unique initiative where the platform doesn't take any revenue share at all, passing all funds along to artists.

Since the inception of Bandcamp Fridays in 2020, the platform has contributed $123 million to artists through this initiative alone, complementing the $1.3 billion generated for artists across all Bandcamp transactions to date. This growth is fueled by a highly dedicated fanbase, growing at a rate of approximately 100,000 per month, whose engagement is not just supporting artists financially but also driving a significant shift in how music ecosystems can operate. Bandcamp’s strategy of fostering deep connections within its community has positioned it as a leader in servicing fan passion as well as the artist.

Bandcamp has created an innovative platform allowing artists to directly sell their music products to fans where an unparalleled 85-100% of revenue goes directly to artists. Superfans, the new VIPs in the music industry, and the Artists they support have collaboratively grown Bandcamp into the music industry’s most precious ecosystem. Championing generous compensation, Bandcamp inspires what it means to truly value artists.

Bandcamp is unique among its peers attributing 100% of its growth to what is effectively a social network that has grown organically without advertising since its inception in 2007. Bandcamp has remained unwaveringly committed to serving as the world’s online record store and music community where passionate fans discover, connect with, and directly support the artists they love.

Bandcamp’s market leading strategy extends beyond financial transactions, fostering a robust ecosystem where the music fan is central to the narrative. "Bandcamp is more than a marketplace; it's a thriving community where artists and fans converge to celebrate and sustain the art of music," explained Andrew Jervis, Bandcamp’s Director of Artists and Labels. "This community-driven model not only supports but actively promotes the growth of artists by providing them tools to manage their careers. Artists from virtually every country gain global exposure and connect directly with fans who are eager to support them, not just through purchases but through genuine engagement and feedback. Our platform facilitates these interactions by sharing useful data, enabling fans to express their shared appreciation for music, enabling direct artist-to-fan communications, and through special events like Bandcamp Live and Listening Parties, making it an indispensable hub for music discovery and artist development.."

"Bandcamp's community is truly unique, fostering a deep sense of engagement between artists and fans," says Jansport J, an artist thriving on the platform. "Whether it's releasing a project with fans like Aglana from the UK in mind, knowing that Thomas in New Zealand is eagerly awaiting a pre-order, or anticipating that David in Los Angeles will add my album to his recommended list—these are real interactions that happen on Bandcamp. It's this direct connection with supportive fans across the globe that makes Bandcamp invaluable to independent artists like myself.”

Bryan Biniak, President of Songtradr, Bandcamp’s parent company, highlighted the progressive impact of Bandcamp's model on the music industry, noting a strategic shift toward more equitable financial practices. "We're not standing still. Our ongoing enhancements and investments in Bandcamp are about expanding the platform's capabilities. We're introducing more tools for artists and labels to succeed, enhancing discovery, and building community features. Songtradr is actively investing in the community, the product, and new payment solutions to make the platform even stronger. These developments have already led to a 20% increase in artist earnings and a 30% rise in fan engagement, underscoring the economic vitality of the superfan community and setting the stage for even greater growth," he added.

About Bandcamp Friday:

When Covid 19 hit, Bandcamp announced it would waive its usual fee for one day in order to support artists affected by the shutdown of live music. The first Bandcamp Friday took place on March 20th, and fans bought 800,000 records on Bandcamp in 24 hours, totalling $4.3m of music and merchandise. This was 15 times more than a typical Friday. Fans stepped up for the artist community and showed their commitment with their wallets knowing the purchases they made would go directly to helping the livelihood of the artists they supported. In many cases, fans pay more than the artist retail price for their music and merchandise, demonstrating their heartfelt commitment. Bandcamp announced its ongoing commitment to the artist community by pre-announcing a full year of Bandcamp Fridays for 2024. Friday May 3rd will mark the 40th Bandcamp Friday, where fans can splurge on their favorite artists and share their love, and reciprocally Bandcamp will share its support by waiving 100% of their fees.

Bandcamp is the world’s largest super fan community, an online record store and music community where fans discover, connect with, and directly support the artists they love. Bandcamp fosters a communal experience with music discovery, where artists and fans support each other in a vibrant ecosystem. Bandcamp artists and labels retail a broad range of music products including digital and physical records, vinyl, apparel and merchandise.
