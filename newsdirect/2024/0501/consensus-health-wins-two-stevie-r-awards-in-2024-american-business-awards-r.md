“On behalf of the entire Consensus Health team, we thank the judges of the American Business Awards for recognizing the role our Company plays amid an ever-changing healthcare landscape.

A sincere thank you goes out to our team statewide; they are on the front lines – day in and day out – truly impacting the quality care and service we bring patients. It is this dedication that reaped the successes which were honored in this prestigious awards program,” explained Michael Lovett, Consensus Health chief executive officer.

“When I became the first Consensus Health Medical Group physician in 2018, I never imagined where we’d be today. Now, with nearly 200 physicians throughout New Jersey, we are truly impacting patient health through our ever-growing network of independent physicians spanning primary care and as well as many areas of specialty. Our unrelenting commitment to quality care is attributed to this prominent placement within the ABAs.
