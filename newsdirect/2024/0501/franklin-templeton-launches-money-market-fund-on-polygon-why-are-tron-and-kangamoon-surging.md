Franklin Templeton recently created a money-market fund on the Polygon (MATIC) blockchain, which indicates that institutions are becoming more interested in DeFi. Meanwhile, Tron (TRX) and KangaMoon (KANG) are the best cryptos to buy. Analysts hint that KANG, a Stage 5 presale star, may become a $0.5 crypto in 2024.

The Polygon Crypto May Soar After Franklin Templeton Announcement Franklin Templeton has revealed that the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) will be integrated into the Polygon (MATIC) blockchain. This is a significant step for the first-ever U.S.-registered mutual fund, which now uses public blockchains to perform transactions.

Meanwhile, the Polygon coin has been riding a bullish wave. Over the last week alone, the Polygon crypto value rose from $0.67 to $0.70. During that time, the Polygon market cap increased from $6.88B to $6.97B. This crypto is trading above its 200-day EMA, so experts have made a bullish Polygon price prediction. They foresee growth to $1.10 within Q2 of 2024.

Tron (TRX): Another Good Crypto To Buy Tron (TRX) is another token making waves in this market. Over the last seven days, the Tron price soared from $0.11 to $0.12. The Tron market cap surged from $9.60B to $10.46B in that period. Additionally, Messari reports that Tron had positive growth in many sectors in Q1 of 2024. For example, the USDT on TRON reached $50B.

In addition, there are now 25 technical indicators for the Tron coin in the green. Because of this, market analysts remain bullish on this crypto. In their Tron price predictions, they forecast a rise to $0.17 before Q2 of 2024 ends.

KangaMoon (KANG): The Best New Crypto To Invest InGlobal traders are also gravitating to KangaMoon (KANG), a rising presale sensation. This presale has raised over $5.8M so far and is expected to reach $6M by the end of April 2024. The community has over 20K registered members and 6K KANG holders, showing strong involvement.

Recently, KangaMoon announced a major partnership with RiotSharks, bringing thrilling raids and a $1K monthly reward pool. This development has only increased the level of attention that KangaMoon is getting. Essentially, KangaMoon will launch a P2E game where KANG will be used to buy in-game items and upgrade characters.

What makes KangaMoon unique is its focus on giving back to its community. For example, KangaMoon rewards the most active community members with free KANG tokens before its launch. Therefore, countless individuals are now rushing to like and share KangaMoon's social media posts.

Currently, one KANG costs just $0.0196 in Stage 5 of its presale - a 290% pump from its starting price of $0.005. However, since it has ties to the P2E gaming market, which may reach $885M by 2028, its long-term growth potential is stellar. Experts foresee a rise to $0.5 once a Tier-1 CEX lists KANG in Q2 of 2024. This makes KANG the top crypto to invest in.

Can KangaMoon Outpace Polygon and Tron? KangaMoon possesses a major advantage over Polygon and Tronâ€”a low market cap of $19.6M. This means that KANG will surge much faster, as it needs fewer new funds for its price to rise. Therefore, KANG is the best new crypto to invest in. Sign up for its presale now and get a 10% bonus.
