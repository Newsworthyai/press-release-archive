American Heart Association (AHA) awarded Centre for Neuro Skills, a leading brain injury and rehabilitation provider, with the Group Stroke Heroes award. The group hero award recognizes a group committed to educating, inspiring, and bringing awareness to stroke. CNS was selected among other stroke support groups, stroke teams, families, private associations, medical facilities and more.

CNS’ mission is to provide quality post-acute neurorehabilitation to stroke and traumatic brain injury survivors, helping them to regain their independence. Its group of physicians, researchers, clinicians, and therapists deliver innovative therapy treatment to stroke patients to reduce disability and maximize independence. CNS regularly partners with organizations like AHA and the Brain Injury Association of America to raise funds, awareness, and education for stroke prevention and rehabilitation.

In 2023, CNS raised more than $26,000 for innovative research and education to fight against heart disease and stroke through the participation of four American Heart Association Heart Walks in Dallas, Tarrant County, Kern County, and Austin. CNS President and Chief Executive Officer David Harrington chaired the Kern County Heart Walk, while Dr. Matthew Ashley, Chief Medical Officer, joined the Executive Leadership Team in Austin County. Clinicians and staff across all seven CNS locations hosted fundraisers, silent auctions, and events - all geared toward raising money for the Heart Walks.

“We at Centre for Neuro Skills are all so proud and honored to be recognized with the Group Stroke Hero Award by the American Heart Association,” said David Harrington, president and chief executive officer of Centre for Neuro Skills. “I want to thank our entire CNS team for their tireless dedication to helping our stroke patients receive the best possible rehabilitation therapy.”

In addition to community involvement, CNS’ experts educate the public about stroke through CNS’ media platforms, website, continuing education webinars, contributed content and media interviews. CNS regularly invites stroke survivors to share their stories through their online blog and YouTube channel, showcasing the different types of strokes, the causes of strokes, and their journeys to recovery. AHA also selected one of CNS’ patients, Craig Northcutt, who received the Stroke Survivor Hero award, recognizing an individual who has survived a stroke and used their experience to educate, inspire and bring awareness about stroke.
