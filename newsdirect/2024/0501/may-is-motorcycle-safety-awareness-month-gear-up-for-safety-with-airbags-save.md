While wearable airbag devices have been around for years, they are finally becoming attainable for the average rider. Like the airbag in cars, a wearable motorcycle airbag inflates in a fraction of a second to protect the rider in the event of a crash or impact. These airbags provide essential protection for the vital organs, including the spine, ribcage and even the neck/collarbone area, reducing up to 93% of impact force and the risk of injury.

According to recent research by Darvin Research & Consulting, 42% of the U.S. adult population has a loved one that regularly rides a motorcycle. And 85% say they worry about the safety of their loved ones because they ride a motorcycle. Upon learning about wearable airbags, an overwhelming 96% expressed a desire for their loved ones to utilize this life-saving technology.

Airbags Save is a multi-year effort to educate communities across the country about the evolution of motorcycle safety technology. Specifically, wearable airbags. Most people don’t know that wearable airbag technology has been around for years and protects riders every day.

Here's what's essential to understand about motorcycle wearable airbags:

Comfort and Wearability: They are designed as a vest, worn over clothing but under your typical riding jacket. They are engineered for comfort, ensuring that you barely notice them as you ride.

Impact Absorption: In the event of deployment, the airbag envelops the torso, providing comprehensive protection. For instance, the Alpinestars Tech-Air 5 model is capable of absorbing up to 93% of the impact force, often allowing riders to escape potentially hospital-bound crashes. The often-televised motorcycle race crashes, where riders walk away without major injuries, are a testament to the airbag's protective capabilities.

Types of Airbags: Two main varieties exist:

Tethered: These are physically connected to the motorcycle, and if the rider is ejected from the bike, the tether initiates the inflation of the airbag.

AI Algorithm-Driven: These incorporate a sophisticated internal computer system, complete with gyroscopes and accelerometers, to monitor the rider's motion 1,000 times per second. This technology is so advanced it can predict and respond to a crash faster than the rider's own reflexes.
