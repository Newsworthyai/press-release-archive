After the Hong Kong regulatory authority's approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the crypto market is set to witness a resurgence. Some of the tokens that badly need this approval are Ethereum (ETH) and Polkadot (DOT) which have slipped considerably in the wake of the bearish sentiments. For KangaMoon (KANG), the development is a good way of continuing its bullish momentum, projecting it as one of the best meme coins to buy now.

KangaMoon (KANG)- An Injection of Fresh IdeaKangaMoon's fresh idea is set to revolutionize the meme coin market. The platform blend of SocialFi and GameFI models projects it as the future of meme coin utility, offering a platform where participants come together for an immersive gaming experience.

KangaMoon's ideas also transcend to making the platform a user-centric one. Every participant on the platform has a chance to earn significant rewards through their active participation. Players earn through weekly, monthly, and quarterly competitions. Spectators earn through predictive betting while holders get free tokens through simple social tasks.

At stage 5 of the ICO campaign, KangaMoon has broken through as one of the best meme coins to buy. Its native token KANG has witnessed huge growth, rising from $0.005 at inception to $0.0196 now. With the price rising, investors have also pocketed a 290% ROI for holding on to the token. With the listings across major exchanges set to happen in Q2 2024, KangaMoon's potential ROI could be up 1000%.

Although the token has proved itself in the meme coin market, keen watchers believe more are still to come. With events such as the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs and the upcoming bull market, KangaMoon can truly serve investors with a bounce to $1.

Can The Effect of Hong Kong ETF Approval Kickstart a New Dawn For Ethereum (ETH)?Ethereum (ETH), the number two crypto, has witnessed a subdued performance in recent times, losing almost $1000 of its price value within a few months. However, the recent approval of the Ethereum ETF in Hong Kong is expected to trigger a massive rally in the next few months.

Even though the Ethereum token still has the US SEC to contend with, Ethereum EMA is battling hard to find support at the $3k threshold. If Ethereum's price can find support, analysts observe that it may restage its move above the key resistance level of $3500. Otherwise, a pullback to below $3k can not be ruled out.

Holders Expect Polkadot (DOT) To Surge After Breaking Key Support LevelNow that Polkadot (DOT) has broken out of the support level of $6.5, the token may be set for an extended spell with a bullish sentiment. From the trading outlook, the Polkadot token is moving next into the 100-day EMA located at $8.1 and the Fibonacci retracement level situated at $8.

This audacious jump by Polkadot may be due to the recent massive adoption of the Polkadot network by many projects. Projects such as Moonsong Labs, Origin Trail, and Neuro Web AI have all embraced Polkadot silky blockchain as their preferred network to drive their platform growth.
