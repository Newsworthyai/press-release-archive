# FTN Network Releases 2024 NFL Draft Team Grades and Rookie Fantasy Scouting Guide Following 2024 NFL Draft

--News Direct--

FTN Network, a company built for delivering affordable, customizable, and highly detailed NFL advanced charted data for betting, season-long fantasy, and daily fantasy, ushered the 2024 football season today with the release of its 2024 NFL Draft Team Grades and 2024 Rookie Fantasy Scouting Guide 2.0. The guide, which is authored by FTN President and Sirius XM Radio Host Jeff Ratcliffe, features rookie rankings, projections, veteran comps, dynasty value, trade value charts, draft boards, and more.

FTN’s 2024 football season started on a high note with a successful weekend of NFL Draft coverage after providing NFL fans with some the most accurate set of mock drafts in the industry. In a field of 137 contestants, three FTN analysts finished in the top 15 of the FantasyPros mock draft accuracy contest: Tyler Loechner (4th place), Ratcliffe (13th), and Chris Meaney (14th). No other media company had two or more analysts finish inside the top 20 and Ratcliffe has now finished 13th or better in back-to-back years.

FTN’s coverage included a live blog with instant reactions and fantasy projections from Ratcliffe for every fantasy-relevant rookie selected during the first three rounds of the draft. In addition to Ratcliffe’s projections and analysis, the coverage included insight from FTN’s Chief Analytics Officer and DVOA inventor Aaron Schatz, Mike Randle, Meaney, fantasy analyst Adam Pfeifer, and rookie expert Jeremy Popielarz. FTN also produced immediate, instant-reaction video breakdowns during the first night of the draft.

“We provided fans with the most accurate information before the draft, live fantasy analysis during the draft across multiple mediums and the most comprehensive rookie fantasy scouting guide in the market,” said FTN Network CEO Perry Gershon. “Our extensive coverage of the NFL draft and our ongoing analysis of the incoming rookie class continues to prove that FTN is the one-stop-shop for NFL fans, fantasy players and bettors.”

Along with pre, post and in-draft content, Randle gave all 32 NFL teams a 2024 Draft grade on the A-F scale. The Pittsburgh Steelers, Miami Dolphins and Los Angeles Chargers topped Randle’s charts with A+, A and A grades, respectively. The Carolina Panthers, Las Vegas Raiders and Dallas Cowboys rounded out the bottom of the 32 teams, receiving C grades. Additionally, Randle provided fantasy grades for every team that saw the Chargers score the highest (A+) and the Atlanta Falcons and Cowboys score the lowest (F).

While Ratcliffe’s 2024 Rookie Fantasy Scouting Guide had been released prior to the draft, version 2.0 is now live and includes post-draft information. It can be found here. The guide includes 150 player-by-player breakdowns, draft boards, player comps, rankings for regular and superflex leagues, a dynasty rookie pick trade value chart and more and will be continuously updated before the start of the 2024 NFL season.
