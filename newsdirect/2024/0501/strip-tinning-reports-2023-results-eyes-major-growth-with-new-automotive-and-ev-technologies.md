# Strip Tinning reports 2023 results; eyes major growth with new automotive and EV technologies

--News Direct--

Strip Tinning Holdings PLC (AIM:STG) executive chairman Adam Robson joined Proactive's Stephen Gunnion with an overview of the company and highlights of its 2023 financial year.

Founded in Birmingham 50 years ago, Strip Tinning originally manufactured copper strips for automotive demisters. Over time, it evolved into a specialist producer of connectors used in car glazing systems, integrating electronics like aerials and radar within automotive glass. Recently, the company expanded into the Battery Technologies division, targeting the burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) market with specialised connectors for battery packs, marking a significant diversification of its product offerings.

Robson highlighted 2023 as a pivotal year, featuring robust commercial progress with a revenue of £10.8 million and an adjusted EBITDA of £0.1 million. The Glazing division, contributing the majority of sales, achieved a substantial turnaround, with gross margins increasing from 6% in 2020 to 40% in 2023. This recovery is credited to strategic adjustments made in response to external challenges like the Ukraine conflict and inflationary pressures. Additionally, the company recently secured significant new orders, bolstering its order book by 91% and promising considerable future growth.

Looking ahead, Robson envisions 2025 as a transformative year for Strip Tinning, driven by these new ventures, especially in the EV and smart glass markets. A recent capital raise of £5.1 million is aimed at supporting these growth ambitions, positioning the company for a potential doubling of sales over the next three years.
