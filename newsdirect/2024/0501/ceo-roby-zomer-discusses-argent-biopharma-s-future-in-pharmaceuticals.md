# CEO Roby Zomer discusses Argent BioPharma's future in pharmaceuticals

--News Direct--

Argent BioPharma managing director and CEO Roby Zomer speaks to Proactive's Stephen Gunnion

following the company's rebranding from MGC Pharmaceuticals, alongside a comprehensive restructuring.

Zomer explained the shift marks a refined focus on the pharmaceutical sector, discarding previous activities not aligned with pure pharmaceutical processes. Zomer highlighted the companyâ€™s advancement in drug discovery, particularly through a multidisciplinary approach and modern technologies such as nanotechnology and mRNA modulation. These innovations are targeted at addressing unmet medical needs.

The company has developed notable products including CannEpil and CimetrA. CannEpil targets refractory epilepsy and has shown efficacy in controlling seizures without reported adverse events. CimetrA, developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, is designed to alleviate COVID-19 symptoms and prevent cytokine storms, with potential applications in treating other autoimmune diseases. Both drugs are now being prescribed in key markets including the United States and Europe.

Zomer expressed optimism about the future, emphasizing ongoing research and progress in obtaining regulatory approvals. The focus will remain on enhancing early patient access schemes, which are expected to significantly impact revenue. Over the next 24 months, Argent BioPharma plans to introduce more innovative treatments to the market.
