# Air|Water wraps up the largest Porsche gathering to hit Southern California

--News Direct--

The second annual – and first standalone – Air|Water Porsche enthusiast show, produced by the Luftgekühlt events team, celebrated a tremendous success this weekend, with artistically curated cars attracting more than 11000 enthusiasts, who immersed themselves in the celebration of 75 years of everything Porsche.

The team welcomed more than 1000 registered display cars spread throughout the 130 acre site at the Orange County Fair & Event Center. There was no shortage of discoverable experiences and aching feet. From the galleries created in the six main exhibition halls, to the off-road and rallye machines in the Action Sports Arena, the Broad Arrow Live Auction in The Hangar, and a sold-out exhibit hall featuring companies catering to the Porsche enthusiast, there was something for everybody at Air|Water. Also featured were 33 white Porsches in the Pacific Amphitheatre, custom restored builders in Park Plaza, and a barn full of vintage finds. The display cars even stretched across several expansive lots as Air|Water provided an unforgettable day for Porsche fans.

In addition to spectacles such as a Porsche-powered Formula 1 car, Le Mans winners, and Pikes Peak entrants, visitors were able to meet VIPs including the show organizers and decorated racers Patrick Long and Jeff Zwart, plus Porsche Factory racers Jörg Bergmeister and Alwin Springer.

While there were long lines at times for the clothing capsule and event merchandise, visitors and fans are now able to purchase any of the Air|Water items from the comfort of their sofa via luftgekuhlt.com/collections

The entire Air|Water team would like to thank everybody who attended the show, the owners who displayed their cars, the brands that participated, the collectors who provided the extremely significant featured cars, and the event partners who contributed to the overall experience. It takes a village and we’re delighted to be part of yours!
