# Heat Stroke and Heat-Related Illness Rapidly Rising as Global Temperatures Climb

The number of people exposed to extreme heat has grown exponentially due to climate change, according to the World Health Organization. The New York Times reported that June 2024 was the 13th consecutive month to break the global heat record. In 2023, 32 million people across California, Texas and Nevada experienced the hottest summer ever recorded in the United States. Centre for Neuro Skills (CNS), a leading provider of traumatic and acquired brain injury rehabilitation services with seven locations in California and Texas, shares essential tips for heat stroke prevention. Taking proactive measures to avoid heat stroke can be the difference between life and death.

To avoid heat stroke:

1. Dress in lightweight, loose-fitting clothing
2. Apply sunscreen to avoid sunburn and keep the body cool
3. Drink plenty of water and avoid sugary or alcoholic drinks
4. Limit time outside to when it is cooler or if you must go out when temperatures are high, rest often
5. Avoid leaving children or animals in parked cars, even if the windows are cracked open
6. Monitor loved ones who are at high risk for developing heat stroke
7. Check local news for extreme heat alerts

“Of all the heat-related illnesses, heat stroke is the most serious. Heat stroke occurs when the body is no longer able to regulate temperature and cool down,” said Dr. Gary Seale, Regional Director of Clinical Services at CNS. “Body temperatures can rise rapidly to 104 degrees or higher which can cause damage to organs, including the brain, and result in permanent disability. Heat stroke can cause brain swelling, seizures, and lead to chronic inflammation, all of which disrupt brain function.”

Children under 4 years old, adults over 65 years old with illnesses or medications that prevent body temperature regulation and people that are clinically classified as obese are all at higher risk of heat stroke. Heat exhaustion can be caused by engaging in strenuous activity, overexposure to hot weather and humidity and wearing excessive clothing that does not allow sweat to evaporate. Symptoms of heat stroke include high body core temperature, flushed skin, dizziness, loss of consciousness for longer than a few seconds, rapid heart rate, difficulty breathing, muscle cramps, seizures, vomiting and diarrhea.

If you or a loved one are showing signs of heat stroke, call 911 immediately or transport the person to the hospital. While waiting for help, keep the person in a cool environment, remove unnecessary clothing and apply ice packs or cool water to their skin.
