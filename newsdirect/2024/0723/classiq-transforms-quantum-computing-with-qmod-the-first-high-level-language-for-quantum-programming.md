# Classiq Transforms Quantum Computing with Qmod, The First High-Level Language for Quantum Programming

Classiq today announced the general availability of Qmod (Quantum Modeling Language), the first high-level language (HLL) for quantum coding. Following successful pilot projects with enterprise partners, Qmod is now accessible to developers, researchers and enterprises worldwide and will transform quantum computing with its efficient, approachable method of programming.

Qmod facilitates advanced quantum modeling and enables developers to describe quantum algorithms at a high level of abstraction. It supports unique quantum-computing concepts alongside conventional constructs found in high-level classical programming languages. This innovative approach allows developers to focus on the functional intent of their algorithms while Classiq’s powerful compiler and synthesis engine handle the intricate hardware-aware quantum implementation details.

“To deliver a business or scientific value, quantum computing must be useful and accessible to scientists and engineers seeking to use quantum computing to solve real-world problems, which today it is not,” said Heather West, PhD, Research Manager, Quantum Computing at IDC. “Today, programming a quantum computer happens at the hardware level, making the technology only accessible to quantum physicists and other quantum specialists. As we begin to talk about quantum utility and near-term applications, abstraction-level application programming will become a necessity for wide-spread quantum adoption and usage.”

Why The Qmod Language Is Different

* Declarative programming: Qmod’s declarative nature lets users define what their algorithm should achieve rather than how to achieve it; Classiq’s synthesis engine compiler optimizes for hardware and other constraints automatically.
* Flexibility and interoperability: Whether through native syntax, Python or graphical representation, Qmod descriptions are easily translatable and compatible across different formats and hardware.
* Industry-ready: Qmod is a tool for researchers and industry applications, providing robust scalable solutions for enterprise-grade quantum software development in an era of steadily growing qubit counts and the resulting coding complexity.

“As we go further in building a complete quantum software stack, our groundbreaking Qmod language enables quantum experts to produce sophisticated programs while also allowing developers without a quantum background to innovate and solve complex problems across a variety of industry domains,” said Nir Minerbi, CEO and co-founder of Classiq. “By abstracting the complexities of quantum programming, Qmod delivers the ability to create and deploy dynamic quantum applications effortlessly. In some cases, it’ll use perhaps five lines of code instead of the traditional 100 lines of code. Like Java for the worldwide web or BASIC for PCs, Qmod is intended to open the gates to advanced quantum implementation.”

Classiq’s platform ensures that quantum algorithms designed with Qmod can be seamlessly compiled for a broad range of hardware and simulation environments, as well as supporting seamless HPC integration. The platform's synthesis engine dynamically adapts implementations to different hardware configurations, allowing for rapid benchmarking and ensuring optimal implementations that make the very most of the available hardware.
