# HIBBETT HOSTS ANNUAL CLIPS & KICKS, BACK-TO-SCHOOL EVENTS WITH FREE CHILDREN’S HAIRCUTS AND SCHOOL SUPPLIES

Hibbett, an athletic-inspired fashion retailer with more than 960 specialty stores nationwide, today announced the annual ‘Clips and Kicks’ Back-to-School campaign, kickstarting the new school year with giveaways, fun and freebies for school-aged children. Clips & Kicks events will run from July 28 through August 25 at select *Hibbett locations nationwide.

“This is a popular and fun event for us to host each year and provide our neighbors with some relief as they get their kids ready for the new school year,” said Robby Bullington, VP Store Operations - Hibbett. “We know that back to school prep can be overwhelming and we’ve found that parents really appreciate not having to pay for a barber or school supplies. They can bring their kids into a store, get them free haircuts and free gear and enjoy some shopping – it’s all about added value.”
