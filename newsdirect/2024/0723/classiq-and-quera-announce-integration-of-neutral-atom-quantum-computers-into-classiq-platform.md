# Classiq and QuEra Announce Integration of Neutral-Atom Quantum Computers into Classiq Platform

Classiq, the leader in quantum software development, and QuEra Computing, the leader in neutral-atom quantum computing, today announced a strategic collaboration to integrate QuEra’s cutting-edge neutral-atom quantum computers into the Classiq platform. This integration will enable customers to optimize a wide variety of quantum and hybrid quantum/classical algorithms for QuEra’s quantum computers, leveraging the unique capabilities of QuEra’s advanced quantum technology.

With this collaboration, Classiq users will be able to exploit the distinctive features of QuEra’s neutral-atom quantum computers, such as the ability to simultaneously operate on multiple qubits and advanced qubit shuttling. Additionally, the integration provides access to Classiq’s extensive pre-written algorithmic blocks and allows customers to estimate the resources needed to run their algorithms. These capabilities enable the creation of highly resource-efficient algorithms with a large number of qubits and, in the future, for logical qubits as well.

“Our partnership with QuEra represents a significant step forward in the quantum computing landscape,” said Nir Minerbi, CEO of Classiq. “By integrating QuEra’s neutral-atom technology into our platform, we are providing our users with unprecedented opportunities to enhance and optimize their quantum algorithms. This collaboration underscores our commitment to delivering the most versatile and powerful quantum computing solutions available.”

“We are thrilled to collaborate with Classiq and bring the power of our neutral-atom quantum computers to a broader audience,” said Yuval Boger, Chief Commercial Officer of QuEra. “Classiq’s platform is renowned for its ease of use and flexibility, and by integrating our technology, we can help users unlock new potential and achieve groundbreaking results in their quantum computing projects.”

The integration of QuEra’s quantum computers into the Classiq platform is expected to accelerate the development and deployment of quantum applications across various fields, including pharmaceuticals, finance, logistics and more. Customers who have purchased on-premises computers will be able to use the Classiq platform for the rapid development of quantum algorithms. This partnership highlights the ongoing commitment of both companies to drive innovation and make quantum computing more accessible and impactful.
