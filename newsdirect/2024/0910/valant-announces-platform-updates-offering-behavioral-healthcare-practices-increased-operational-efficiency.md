# Valant Announces Platform Updates Offering Behavioral Healthcare Practices 
Increased Operational Efficiency

Valant, a leading EHR for behavioral healthcare practices, unveiled new platform updates for behavioral health practices today. New capabilities supporting operational efficiencies, workflows, and revenue collection include Valant Treatment Plans and Valant Custom Forms.

Automating workflows, which previously were manual processes, ensures practices can be efficient, meet payer obligations, and cover legal liabilities as they bring on new patients.

Valant Treatment Plans

Valant’s new Treatment Plans feature solves complex payer documentation requirements through one efficient and flexible system. Meeting the evolving needs of payers through treatment plan types with customizable fields and reminder-based review cycles, practices can now create a consistent treatment experience with research-backed content libraries of 1000+ preset problems, goals, objectives, and interventions.

Additionally, it helps set operational guardrails, ensuring clinicians meet payer requirements without manual oversight, so practices have peace of mind when they receive their next audit request.

Valant Custom Forms

Valant’s Custom Forms empowers practices to build advanced automated forms and segment intake flow by program, routing the right consent documents to new patients based on the services they seek. Practices can auto-assign different packets to new clients seeking adult psychotherapy versus new patients being seen for adolescent psychiatric evaluations.

“Collecting patient data and consent is a time-consuming, tough-to-track process that often involves multiple external solutions, manual data entry, and for larger practices, a dedicated intake team,” said Ram Krishnan, CEO of Valant. “We aim to make this process fast, trackable, and easy to use so practices work start to finish in Valant.”

Valant is designed specifically for behavioral health professionals in group and solo private practices, offering an integrated solution that allows practices to provide better care, run a smoother and more efficient operation, and remain compliant.
