# RIA Circle™ Launches, Providing a Membership Environment to Share Best Practices Across the Wealth Management Ecosystem

RIA Circle™, a wealth management peer-to-peer community designed to facilitate best practices among a diverse group of financial advisors, has launched today, creating a secure and confidential environment to facilitate advisor growth.

Led by longtime financial services executive Carolyn Armitage, RIA Circle™ is a member-based organization that brings together registered investment advisors, hybrids, and investment advisor representatives to share ideas and best practices through monthly Peer Roundtable Meetings. Groups are forming now for an October start to the Roundtable meetings.

“Growth takes insight and experience, and RIA Circle™ was formed as a vehicle to allow growth-minded advisors and executives to have access to shared ideas to better run their firms and serve clients,” Armitage said. “Over the past 35 years, I have personally seen collaboration can be a true laboratory for great ideas. RIA Circle™ will foster these ideas to have a real impact on wealth management leaders and their firms.”

Financial advisors who apply to and are accepted in RIA Circle™ will be placed in tailored groups based on their needs and experience. Each group will be led by a facilitator known as a Captain, who will lead the discussions each month with the agendas and support materials created by Armitage due to her extensive consulting and industry expertise.

“It’s an exciting time to be in the RIA industry,” said Trey Prescott, an RIA Circle™ Captain and Director at Advisory Services Network LLC in Atlanta. “The need in creating industry circles and a support platform is at an all-time high for people to compare and contrast what they’re doing right and wrong. I think the RIA Circle™ platform will give a competitive edge and mirror to all that join.”

In addition to the monthly collaboration, members also have access to the full community through the Advisor Directory and connection opportunities including a bulletin board, discussion feeds, and direct messaging, as well as curated content on industry and economic news and trends. Advisors can even upload their own material and articles to share and discuss with other members and post jobs for which they are hiring.

Lastly, there are 20 Strategic Collaborators who will be offering their wisdom with the RIA Circle™ community via workshops hosted throughout each month, as a value-added benefit. This is just Phase 1, there are 4 additional Phases planned for enhancing the community.

So far, advisors representing $64.7 billion in assets under management have been accepted into RIA Circle™, who utilize 10 different custodians and 10 independent broker-dealers.

“The work of financial advisors is important in securing the wealth and future of so many Americans,” Armitage said. “We are excited to provide a community to provide the best resources to ensure wealth managers have the right tools and ideas to serve their clients and fulfil their mission.”
