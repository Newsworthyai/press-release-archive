# MCC Brokerage Named One of America’s 
Fastest-Growing Private Companies by Inc. 5000

MCC Brokerage, an innovative field marketing organization in the life and health insurance industry and affiliate partner of AmeriLife Group, LLC, today announced its first inclusion on Inc. 5000’s annual list of the fastest-growing private companies in America.

With over 25 years of agency management experience, MCC Brokerage has built a robust network of resources designed to support licensed agents with top-flight resources, marketing and lead programming, compliance training and guidance, and its flagship professional development program, MCC Academy.

“I am deeply honored and humbled that our company has been recognized in the Inc. 5000 list for the first time in our history,” said Darren Houck, CEO of MCC Brokerage. “This achievement is a testament to our team's hard work and dedication. As we celebrate this milestone, I am reminded that accolades do not measure our success. Instead, it's the service and value we provide to our agents and agency principals daily. I am grateful to our team for their commitment to excellence, our clients for trusting us with their needs, and AmeriLife for its unwavering partnership and servant leadership.”

“I am thrilled to congratulate Darren and the MCC Brokerage team on being recognized as one of America's Fastest Growing Companies by Inc. 5000,” added Scotty Elliott, Chief Distribution Office of Health for AmeriLife. “This prestigious accolade is a testament to their relentless dedication, innovative spirit, and exceptional leadership. We are proud to partner with such a forward-thinking organization and are excited to see what heights their continued growth will lead to in the future.”

The prestigious ranking provides a data-driven look at the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses. In addition to Microsoft, Meta, Chobani, Under Armour, Timberland, Oracle, Patagonia, and many other household-name brands, MCC Brokerage gains its first national exposure as an honoree on this year’s Inc. 5000 list of the fastest-growing private companies in the country.

The Inc. 5000 class of 2024 represents companies that have driven rapid revenue growth while navigating inflationary pressure, the rising costs of capital, and seemingly intractable hiring challenges. Among this year’s top 5000 companies, the average median three-year revenue growth rate is 1,637 percent. This year’s Inc. 5000 companies have added 874,458 jobs to the economy over the past three years.

“One of the greatest joys of my job is going through the Inc. 5000 list,” says Mike Hofman, who recently joined Inc. as editor-in-chief. “To see all the intriguing and surprising ways companies are transforming sectors, from health care and AI to apparel and pet food, is fascinating as a journalist and storyteller. Congratulations to this year’s honorees, as well, for growing their businesses fast despite the economic disruption we all faced over the past three years, from supply chain woes to inflation to changes in the workforce.”

The 2024 Inc. 5000 companies are ranked according to percentage revenue growth from 2020 to 2023. Companies must have been founded and have generated revenue by March 31, 2020, to qualify. They must be U.S.-based, privately held, for-profit, and independent—not subsidiaries or divisions of other companies—as of December 31, 2023.
