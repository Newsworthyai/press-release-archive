# Bitcoin (BTC) Stability Boosted By Massive ETF Inflows, Rebel Satoshi is on a dream presale run

In the constantly changing world of cryptocurrency, periods of stability are really sought after, especially for Bitcoin (BTC). Right now, Bitcoin is seeing a boost in investor trust, thanks to big investments in spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and favorable trading situations. At the same time, Rebel Satoshi Arcade (RECQ), a crypto project led by its community, is making great progress in its presale stage, catching the eye of both investors and fans.

Massive ETF Inflows Boost Bitcoin Stability

Bitcoin's recent stability can be credited to the huge influx of investments into spot BTC ETFs, signaling growing confidence among investors. According to Bitfinex researchers, Bitcoin has found solid support around the $60,000 level, thanks to consistently strong daily closures and significant withdrawals from crypto exchanges. Even with the massive outflows totaling $3.85 billion on May 15, Bitcoin's volatility remained low, and the cryptocurrency held its ground.

What's particularly interesting is the spot Bitcoin ETF market in the US, which has seen net inflows for seven days in a row. This trend shows that investors are increasingly interested in BTC-related investment products, highlighting the growing appeal of Bitcoin as an asset class.
