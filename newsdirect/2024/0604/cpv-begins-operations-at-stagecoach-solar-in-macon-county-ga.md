# CPV Begins Operations at Stagecoach Solar in Macon County, GA

Today, Competitive Power Ventures’ (CPV) affiliate CPV Renewable Power announced the commencement of operations at CPV Stagecoach Solar, an 80-MWac solar power generation facility in Macon County, Georgia.

Utilizing over 180,000 bi-facial solar panels and single-axis tracking to maximize energy production, the project will help avoid nearly 80,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year by displacing generation from older, nonrenewable facilities. This is equivalent to removing approximately 16,000 cars from the road.

“Our vision for a reliable, low carbon electric supply includes a substantial amount of solar and wind which requires an accelerated build out of this technology,” said Gary Lambert, CEO of CPV. “Having the plan is only one part of the equation - actual execution takes a tremendous amount of collaboration and effort from everyone involved. We are proud to be celebrating alongside the local community and our partners as we bring emission free generation to the grid.”

“Bringing our second utility-scale solar project online in just a few months shows CPV’s commitment to a lower carbon future. By working with partners and the local community, we can use our industry experience to help create a reliable, sustainable grid,” said Sean Finnerty, President of Renewables for CPV. “Of course, we would not be reaching this milestone if it were not for the support of both Andersonville and Macon County throughout the development and construction process. Our team looks forward to our continued engagement and being part of this community for many years to come.”

“This was something our team worked on for a long time, bringing a solar project to this county. We are excited to see CPV Stagecoach come online and grateful to CPV for their hard work in making it a reality,” said Gerald Beckham, Executive Director of The Development Authority of Macon County and Chamber of Commerce. “Already we have reaped the economic benefits of the project, allowing us to inject funds into critical resources all while helping bring new clean energy to Georgia.”

CPV Stagecoach Solar was constructed with the expertise of Vanguard Energy Partners, a leading solar Engineering, Procurement, Construction firm, which will also manage the day-to-day operations of the facility.

“Safety was our highest priority during construction,” said Geoffrey Fairclough, President of Vanguard Energy Partners. “The dedication of everyone involved is evident in the high-quality result, reflecting our commitment to project excellence.”

CPV Stagecoach Solar is the company’s second recent utility scale solar project to enter operations after CPV Maple Hill Solar. It joins five operating wind projects in the company’s renewable portfolio alongside nearly 4 GW of additional renewable projects in development. CPV remains committed to developing and bringing online a mix of renewable and low carbon dispatchable generation to ensure grid reliability and help drive decarbonization in a responsible way.
