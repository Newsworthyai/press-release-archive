# Mediavine Builds Out C-Suite with New Executive Promotions

Mediavine, the largest exclusive full-service ad management firm in the U.S., is building out its C-Suite with key executive promotions. Amanda Martin is taking the newly created role of Chief Revenue Officer (CRO), while Jamie Lieberman expands her role from Chief Legal Officer to Chief Legal Officer & Chief Operations Officer (CLO/COO). These strategic additions to the leadership team enable Mediavine to proactively find solutions within the media industry while continuing to propel Mediavine’s business growth by bringing the highest value to the buy and sell sides including agencies, brands and publishers.

Martin joined Mediavine over a year ago as SVP of Monetization and Business Strategy to optimize growing relationships across the buy and sell sides and has been a key representative for Mediavine in the industry. Martin will lead all revenue related activity including Sales, AdTech, Ad Operations, Partnerships & Commercial Data Strategy, while overseeing Mediavine’s growing DSP and SSP relationships. Martin will also be responsible for Mediavine’s marketing efforts which include a strategic move to tie marketing initiatives more closely to revenue. Previously, Martin served as SVP of Corporate Development and Strategic Partnerships at digital agency Goodway Group.

“I have always been a firm believer that collaboration between the buy and sell sides is what yields the best results for both. This has been how I approached my role at Mediavine, helping our extensive publishing community navigate big industry changes and expand Mediavine beyond supply to highlight the audience strengths of mid to long tail publishers,” said Amanda Martin. “In my new role as CRO, I remain focused on the connection between demand generated from the buy side to the benefit of the publisher and sell side.”

The strategic decision to combine the legal and operations roles at Mediavine is a reflection of the industry's changing landscape and Lieberman's experience as Mediavine's General Counsel, during which she operationalized numerous aspects of the business. This experience has allowed her to integrate processes to create a more sophisticated data-driven organization. In her new role, she continues to influence strategic direction on policies and procedures, intellectual property, contract negotiations and compliance, while also taking on Operations, including Project Management, InfoSec, IT, and Business Intelligence.

"Privacy and data are two important pillars to our organization, and I am delighted to have the opportunity to oversee the legal and operations teams at Mediavine to ensure we are leading the industry through our approach,” said Jamie Lieberman. "I look forward to working closely with our team to ensure that we continue to navigate the legal and operational challenges of the digital media industry successfully."

“We are excited to build out our C-Suite with the introduction of these two important roles. Amanda and Jamie have proven themselves to be highly strategic and innovative leaders who are helping to evolve our company in a way that sets us up for continued success. By streamlining operations, legal, marketing and sales, we become more agile, effective and ultimately a stronger partner to our publishers as well as brand and agency partners,” said Eric Hochberger, Mediavine Co-Founder and CEO. “I am also personally proud to expand the leadership team with two women who are strong believers in supporting and promoting other women in AdTech, a value that Mediavine and I share and will continue to champion.”
