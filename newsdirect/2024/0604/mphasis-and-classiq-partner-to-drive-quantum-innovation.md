Quantum computing's ability to tackle previously unsolvable problems opens doors for entirely new discoveries and innovations. National Institute of Standards and Technology’s report states that quantum computing could lead to breakthroughs in areas like materials science, drug discovery, and financial modelling.

McKinsey & Company estimates a $106B potential quantum technology market size by 2040. The alliance between Mphasis and Classiq represents a fusion of expertise and innovation, with Classiq's cutting-edge quantum development platform complemented by Mphasis' extensive industry knowledge. Together, the companies aim to pioneer groundbreaking quantum solutions that will reshape sectors primed for transformative change.

Classiq’s platform enables both beginner and expert designers to rapidly generate, analyze, and execute quantum circuits. The collaboration reflects the shared dedication of Mphasis and Classiq, showcasing a commitment to pioneering quantum computing applications across diverse industry sectors.

Apart from this, in June 2021, Mphasis along with the Government of Alberta, and the University of Calgary signed an MoU to announce the launch of the world-leading Quantum City - Canada. The strategic partnerships were to accelerate talent development and the development of a quantum computing ecosystem in Calgary, driving R&D in the technology sector. In June 2022, Mphasis deepened its commitment to Canada by announcing a delivery center in Calgary, opening the center in Alberta for business. The Mphasis business ecosystem was positioned to reinforce the region's reputation as a leading hub for digital transformation, AI, quantum computing, and more, and contribute to Canada's growing digital sector.
