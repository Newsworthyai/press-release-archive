# HTX Issues Security Alert Regarding Exchange Accounts Amid Rising Cyber Treats

Singapore / June 3, 2024 – In light of the increasing sophistication of recent cyberattacks targeting cryptocurrency exchange accounts, HTX, the crypto exchange giant, reportedly issued an urgent security alert to its worldwide users to enhance their security vigilance for safeguarding assets.

Recent Cyberattacks and Analysis

Case 1: A user's Chrome browser was infiltrated via the malicious "Aggr" plugin, resulting in the hijacking of browser cookies. Attackers exploited these cookies to access the user's account of a certain exchange without a login password and 2FA code and transfer out $1 million assets by wash trading.

Case 2: Another user fell victim to a sophisticated attack where attackers purchased their personal information on Telegram. The attackers manipulated the user's exchange account through email login and the forgot password option. Subsequently, they applied to change account settings, such as phone number, email address, and even Google Authenticator with AI-generated videos. This breach culminated in the theft of over $2 million assets after 24 hours of changing the account password.

These cases underscore the evolvement of cyber threats, particularly as AI technology is increasingly leveraged by malicious actors. It would be the best if users adopt robust security measures to protect their personal information and assets. For those holding substantial investments, it is critical to implement measures for stringent privacy and isolation, such as disabling third-party plugins and regularly logging out of accounts.
