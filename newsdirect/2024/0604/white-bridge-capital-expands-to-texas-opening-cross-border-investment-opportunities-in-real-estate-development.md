Opening Cross-Border Investment Opportunities in Real Estate Development

Firm Looks to Serve Cross-Border Real Estate Needs of Family Offices, High-Net-Worth Individuals and Entities Seeking to Invest in Multi-Family, Build-to-Suit, Industrial, and Commercial Development Projects

White Bridge Capital, a cross-border real estate investment firm, is extending its reach to Texas to cater to global family offices, high-net-worth individuals, and overseas entities seeking to benefit from the state’s robust economic expansion and the resulting impact on its flourishing real estate market. The portfolio encompasses multi-family residences, build-to-suit properties, industrial facilities, and commercial developments across the state.

In Texas, White Bridge Capital will be spearheaded by newly appointed Partner Nat Parsons, a third-generation developer by training and leading real estate and construction veteran with nearly two decades of experience, including the banking sector.

Co-founded by Tommy Campbell and Regina Garcia Handal, with headquarters in Miami, Florida and operations in Mexico City, White Bridge Capital sources real estate deals, structures investments, secures financing for underlying assets, and manages client investments throughout the real estate development cycle.

“The expansion to Texas marks a significant step in the firm’s growth and its intent to have a strategic physical presence to look after our clients’ overall interests,” said Tommy Campbell, Co-Founder and Managing Partner, White Bridge Capital. “Investors are focused on long-term appreciation and greater control, and White Bridge Capital, with our ‘boots on the ground’ approach, stands ready to source real estate investments in Texas that offer clients active management.”

Cross-border family office real-estate investments across the Americas are on the rise, propelled by macroeconomic and geopolitical drivers. White Bridge Capital is bridging this investment opportunity with its unique customized investment platform underpinned by high-touch, local intelligence, and a robust network of experts across the Americas.

“Nat is an outstanding business leader. His extensive experience and strategic vision in managing complex real estate deals, leading construction projects and teams, will be invaluable to our firm and clients,” said Regina Garcia Handal, Co-Founder and Managing Partner, White Bridge Capital. “In partnership with Nat, we look forward to our Texas office thriving into the future.”

A graduate of Texas A&M University, Nat holds a master’s in business administration and a bachelor’s in construction science, focusing on business, project planning, and construction management of high-quality facilities. A proud and devoted father, Parsons is a U.S. rugby player, the son of architects and grandson of Nathaniel E. Parsons, president of N. E. Parsons Sheet Metal and Roofing Company 1924.

“White Bridge Capital’s leadership, client base, and market reach are unparalleled,” said Parsons. Together with Tommy, Regina, and Texas’ pro-business and investor-friendly policies, I look forward to serving new and existing clients. The opportunities to grow in Texas are endless.”

Texas is an appealing destination for investors, particularly those from Latin America, given its overall business-friendly environment, infrastructure development, technological advancements, and strong economic growth – accelerated by trade with Mexico – attracting diverse industries to the state, resulting in population growth and an attractive real estate market.
