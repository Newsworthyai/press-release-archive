In the early 90s and even 2000s, ads were a key part of consuming media and advertising was, in a way, fun. Commercials were part of the popular culture monolith and it was clear that advertising budgets were spent with intention. Ask any 90s kid, and they can quote the most popular ads of the time, whether that is Tony the Tiger’s “They’re G-r-r-reat!” or Verizon’s (NYSE: VZ) “Can you hear me now?” Today, the landscape of ads has changed, and the overall feeling is not one of enjoyment but rather fatigue.

Advertising seems to be missing its mark for the majority of viewers. While ads have always been looked at through the lens of doubt, only 4% of people in a recent study by Inc. Magazine believed they were trustworthy. Not to mention, people feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of ads they are exposed to on a daily basis, which makes them more likely to tune them out. Additionally, the cultural significance of advertising has diminished due to the increasing amount of ads on the internet, and most ads are not viewed as entertaining or effective at selling products. There has also been recent discourse that criticizes the rise of "woke-wash" advertising or makes false claims about social or environmental responsibility just for profit.

“It’s harder to reach audiences, the cost of marketing is going up, the number of channels has exponentially proliferated and the cost to cover all of those channels has proliferated,” Jay Pattisall, the lead author of a recent advertising report, shared in an interview. “It’s a continual pressure for marketers – we’re no longer just creating advertising campaigns three or four times a year and running them across a few networks and print.”
