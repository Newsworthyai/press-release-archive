# Clarified Precision Medicine and xCures Form Strategic Partnership to Transform Patient Outcomes Through Precision Oncology

Clarified Precision Medicine, the only company that provides oncologists with prioritized therapy options via a combination of expert medical provider review and underlying artificial intelligence (AI) computational algorithms, and xCures, a healthcare technology company that delivers real-time clinical data to power precision medicine support, today announced a strategic partnership to dramatically advance the field of precision oncology.

The two companies will come together to enhance cancer-care delivery and personalized patient treatment recommendations through precision medicine and data-driven analysis. The goal of the alliance is to better identify and understand current gaps in providing precision medicine and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

Oncology faces an immediate need to improve access to precision medicine. In the United States, there are 18 million patients with a history of cancer and 1.9 million new cancer diagnoses each year. Patients who receive precision therapies have survival rates that are three times greater than those who do not. However, 75 percent of doctors say they need help interpreting the genomic tests that make precision medicine possible — which, in turn, leads to more effective utilization of these powerful 21st-century tools.

To that end, Clarified and xCures will collaborate on patient-level data analytics and work together to improve provider support, education, and communication. The two organizations will develop learning systems focused on innovative solutions in precision oncology, such as predictive analytics and treatment optimization.

Clarified will contribute its specialized treatment recommendation system, which combines insights from experienced medical professionals with support from its AI-driven treatment algorithm. The company’s team of expert medical reviewers will provide clinical oversight. xCures will provide its AI-driven technology platform, which excels at extracting the critical information needed for care among the complex cancer patient data and enhancing access to medical records.

“This partnership unites two of the most innovative leaders in the field of precision oncology,” said Clarified Precision Medicine CEO Rajni Natesan, MD, MBA. “Clarified is the leading expert in closing gaps at the last mile of precision oncology, with an AI platform and the greatest understanding of physician needs and individual patient outcomes. xCures is a leader in data and technology that transforms clinical efficiency and patient care. This powerful alliance enables us to overcome obstacles in cancer care that can only be addressed by an advanced, data-driven understanding of oncology at the patient level.”

"We are excited to partner with Clarified Precision Medicine to harness the power of real-time clinical data and advanced analytics,” said xCures CEO Mika Newton. “This collaboration will enable us to deliver highly personalized and effective treatment recommendations, ultimately improving patient outcomes in precision oncology. By combining our strengths, we can address the critical need for better access to precision medicine and support oncologists in making data-driven decisions that enhance patient care."

In addition to improving the utilization of precision medicine, the alliance will have significant capabilities in data collection and analytics to drive precision oncology research. The technology integration between Clarified and xCures will facilitate retrospective and prospective data analysis to improve treatment strategies and patient care outcomes.
