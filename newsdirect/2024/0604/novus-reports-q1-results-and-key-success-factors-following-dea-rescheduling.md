# Novus Reports Q1 Results And Key Success Factors Following DEA Rescheduling

Miami, Florida - (ThriveNewsWire) - Novus Acquisition & Development Corp d/b/a Novus Cannabis MedPlan (OTC Markets: (NDEV) is a leading national supplemental health insurance carrier and pioneer in offering cannabis in health plans for recreational and medicinal users. It released its update on its Q1 2024 results, Rx Dispensing Platform, and Key Elements that fuel its success after the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) announced that cannabis will be rescheduled.

Novus Cannabis MedPlan (Novus) has been integrating cannabis into health plans since 2015. With a network of over 1,200 agents, brokers, and dispensaries, Novus aims to make cannabis-based treatments more affordable and accessible through insurance plans, benefitting a wider range of consumers.

Here are three key highlights that contribute to Novus' success.

1) Financial Snapshot:

The company utilizes a receivable-based business model with minimal overhead and no convertible debt, demonstrating consistent organic growth year over year.

No Dilution: No common stock has been issued after June 15, 2021.

No Sales of Insider Shares: For close to 3 years

Gross Revenue Increase: During this reporting period, Gross Revenue increased by 6.8% compared to March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively,

Net Revenue Increase: During this reporting period, EBITDA increased by 19.47% compared to March 31, 2024, and 2023.

Profit Margin: During the reporting period, the company experienced a gradual increase in gross profit margins, with margins of 43.14% in 2023 and 45.2% in 2024

Cash and Cash Equivalents: There was an increase of 1.8% compared to the financial reporting periods on March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023. This is in contrast to the higher increase of 6.84% in the period from March 31, 2023, to 2024.

Leak Out Vendor Shares: All vendors who received treasury-issued stock must gradually sell their shares. The selling amount is determined based on 15% of the average daily trading volume over the past 30 days.

2) Introducing the Rx Dispensing Platform

Novus is strategically positioning its cannabis health plans to become a prominent player in mainstream healthcare insurance by acquiring an Rx Dispensing Platform tech stack. Frank Labrozzi, CEO of Novus, stated, "This advancement will significantly impact cannabis in health plans. By promoting collaboration between brands and dispensaries, we aim to empower policyholders with more choices, enabling them to purchase the brands they prefer at any dispensary.

Cannabis brands can use the platform to connect directly with dispensaries and showcase their products at no cost. This will improve product distribution efficiency, increase brand visibility, provide real-time inventory data, and facilitate product research for the policyholder.

An added bonus to For Rec Users: This platform serves recreational users who prefer not to disclose personal information like their policyholder status to access plan benefits. Instead, users can discreetly order services for a small subscription or transaction fee.

3) Key Success Factors

Midwest Expansion: Novus has partnered with Heya Wellness, a prominent cannabis company in Missouri, to offer MedPlans to 4.3 million potential policyholders in the Midwest. By leveraging Missouri's favorable reciprocity laws, Novus aims to maximize the benefits for our sales hub based in St. Louis.

Health Carrier Alliances Integration with Traditional Healthcare:

By treating cannabis as a traditional pharmaceutical product and including it in insurance plans, Novus could help normalize cannabis use for medical, recreational, and non-users. Now that there is federal approval, Novus bridges traditional healthcare and the cannabis industry, enhancing major healthcare carriers who have expressed interest in integrating Novus' cannabis-based prescription plans into their benefits packages, establishing a connection between the two industries.

Compassionate Care Act (CCA): The CCAs, which the Supreme Court sanctions, typically focus on making medical marijuana accessible to workplace patients with specific conditions. Human Resources departments are revising workplace policies to allow employees to access medical marijuana through employer-sponsored health plans. Novus plans to cover some costs through tax-deductible health savings and health reimbursement accounts.

Opioid Settlement Framework:

The opioid settlement framework is a legal agreement aimed at resolving litigation against pharmaceutical companies and health carriers accused of contributing to the opioid crisis. It includes $50 billion for prevention, treatment, and recovery programs with the goal of mitigating the crisis' impact and preventing future misuse. Novus is playing a crucial role in reducing opioid use by offering states and private organizations alternative treatment options through our developed health plans that help patients transition from opioids to medical cannabis.

Compliance with the Veteran’s Affairs (VA): Veterans are increasingly interested in utilizing cannabis for treatment—over 88% support medical cannabis programs. Novus has developed health plans following VA guidelines to integrate cannabis benefits for veterans.

In closing: As Novus adjusts to the positive changes in federal cannabis regulation, we are prepared to utilize our niche approach to cannabis in health plans, which utilizes a receivables-based business model. This approach strategically enables us to organically invest in critical areas such as marketing, improving engagement with policyholders and providers, and establishing a reliable cash flow management system. This positions Novus as a significant player in the fast-evolving cannabis integrated into health insurance plans.

Novus Acquisition & Development Corp. (NDEV) operates through its subsidiary, WCIG Insurance Services, Inc., offering health insurance and related insurance solutions in states with legal medical marijuana programs. With a robust infrastructure covering various insurance lines, including health, life, and fixed annuities, Novus is a leading health insurance carrier, using two key indicators to gauge value and performance.

The Benefit Monetization Ratio measures the annual total of monetized policies, offset by the operating cost ratio, a Balance Sheet line item derived from Net Asset Value and calculated to the Price Book Value.

Novus' medical cannabis benefits package operates as an outside developer. It does not engage in any activities related to the cultivation, handling, transportation, growth, extraction, dispensing, sale, marketing, vending, delivery, supply, circulation, or trade of cannabis or any substances violating United States law or the Controlled Substances Act. The company adheres strictly to state and federal laws and has no intentions to violate them in the future.

It is important to note that statements regarding specific products have not been evaluated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and should not be interpreted as intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent disease. The information provided in press releases and product labels is for informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for advice from qualified healthcare professionals.

Novus respects the individual transactions involving cannabis, which are solely between state-licensed dispensaries and registered patients. However, it's worth noting that state laws may conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act. The current administration has indicated that federal law enforcement agencies will not prioritize prosecuting those complying with state-designated laws concerning medical marijuana usage and distribution. Nevertheless, changes in government policies and consolidation could impact the provider network, and there is no assurance that future administrations will not alter this stance.

While Novus does not engage in the harvest, distribution, or sale of cannabis or cannabis-related products, the company could be affected if there were any shifts in enforcement by federal or state governments concerning existing laws. Such changes could result in significant financial implications for Novus and other industry players.
