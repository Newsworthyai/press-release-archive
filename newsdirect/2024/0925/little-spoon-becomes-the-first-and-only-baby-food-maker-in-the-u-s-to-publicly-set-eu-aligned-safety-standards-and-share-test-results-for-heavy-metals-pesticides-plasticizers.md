# Little Spoon Becomes The First and Only Baby Food Maker In the U.S. To Publicly Set EU-Aligned Safety Standards and Share Test Results for Heavy Metals, Pesticides + Plasticizers

In a groundbreaking move for the baby food industry, Little Spoon, the largest online baby and kids food company in the United States, today becomes the first and only brand in the country to unveil its testing standards and results for heavy metals, pesticides and plasticizers, making a commitment to never sell any product that falls short of its strict limits. The launch of this significant transparency initiative comes in response to the ongoing national discussion about baby food safety, the urgent need for stricter industry standards, and staggering statistics from a recently commissioned study of 2,000 American parents with children under 2 years old.

As national conversations on baby food safety rapidly gain steam, it has become impossible to ignore the concerning headlines on toxic levels of heavy metals, grocery store brand misinformation and deteriorating consumer trust. Little Spoon partnered with Talker Research to conduct a survey of 2,000 American Parents to pulse check the needs and standards of American parents, and the results uncovered astonishing levels of mistrust and concern around industry safety, federal regulations, and overarching brand commitment. In fact, 95% of parents agree that baby food brands should be doing more to address baby food safety concerns— and only 9% report a ‘high degree’ of trust in baby food companies.

“Quality nutrition and confidence in the products that fuel your family are rights, not privileges.” said co-founder and CEO, Ben Lewis. “We view this as a fundamental responsibility for our industry and a key reason why Little Spoon exists in the first place. The standards for children’s food in the U.S. are maddeningly low. Parents deserve better, and we are doing our part to finally deliver what they deserve.”

Established to bring change to a century old industry, Little Spoon is once again raising the bar in the category by testing and sharing results for every batch of baby food for 500+ contaminants including heavy metals, pesticides, glyphosate and plasticizers. With no current federal regulations set for limiting the levels of chemical contaminants in baby food in the U.S., Little Spoon has aligned its testing standards for heavy metals with the European Union (EU), a long-standing, trusted standard for safety and excellence in the baby space. Consumers can see exact testing limits for each contaminant through a dashboard viewable for every Babyblend product on the brand’s website and can confidently purchase products knowing Little Spoon will not sell any products that do not meet these standards.

“This generation is plagued by concern regarding baby food safety — and for good reason.” said co-founder and Chief Product Officer of Little Spoon, Angela Vranich. “We have always crafted our products with the utmost care, using certified organic ingredients and differentiated processing. We knew we could meet the rigorous EU testing limits for heavy metals in our baby food, and it quickly became our obsession to provide the level of transparency parents truly deserve.”

To draw further attention to this crucial issue for Little Spoon consumers and parents nationwide, the ‘Little Spoon, Big Change’ initiative will be driven by a comprehensive 360-degree marketing campaign launching today. Designed to meet parents’ growing demands for transparency and baby food safety, the campaign will feature media partners, celebrities, tastemakers, and experts including an expanded advisory panel which now features world-class experts in public policy and academics specializing in heavy metals. As a topic often fraught with fear mongering tactics, Little Spoon is leveraging experts, educators and a new AI-powered chatbot on their site to provide education for parents and support the wide-ranging questions that come with baby food safety.

"We won't see large-scale changes until companies like Little Spoon take action," said Dr. Bruce Lanphear, an advisor to Little Spoon who studies childhood exposure to toxic chemicals. "Companies don't need to wait for regulations—they can lead the charge.”

Test results for every Little Spoon Babyblend, alongside detailed ingredient sourcing information are now available on LittleSpoon.com, with plans to roll out additional transparency measures for their robust portfolio of products in the coming months.
