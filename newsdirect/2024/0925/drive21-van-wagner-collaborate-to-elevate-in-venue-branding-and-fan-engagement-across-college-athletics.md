# drive21, Van Wagner Collaborate to Elevate In-Venue Branding and Fan Engagement Across College Athletics

drive21, a leader in experiential design and marketing solutions, today announced a strategic relationship with leading collegiate athletics marketing agency, Van Wagner to become a preferred experiential graphic design and implementation provider for Van Wagner. Van Wagner is recognized for its expertise in collegiate sponsorship sales and multi-media rights and will collaborate with drive21 to redefine branding strategies, drive revenue growth, and create Name, Image and Likeness (NIL) execution opportunities in the collegiate sports industry.

Through this relationship, Van Wagner’s collegiate clients will be afforded advantageous pricing and access to drive21’s suite of services to provide innovative branding and design solutions across their venues; driving innovative solutions that bridge the gap between brand aspirations and reality, creating immersive environments that resonate with audiences and drive tangible business results.

"This relationship represents a significant step forward in our mission to transform sports and entertainment venues into impactful environments that are also powerful marketing tools," said Warren Godridge, drive21 Founder and President. "By collaborating with Van Wagner, we can leverage our creativity and expertise to deliver a consistent brand experience across all venues, enhancing the value for brands, universities, and fans alike."

“Traditional approaches often focus solely on aesthetics and overlook the potential to maximize partnership, sponsorship and NIL opportunities, leaving untapped value on the table” said John Libro, Head of Sports and Entertainment at drive21. “Working with Van Wagner College will allow us to push the boundaries of experiential design and transform collegiate athletic facilities into dynamic revenue-generating tools that engage fans and drive real business growth.”

This relationship may also offer an even more comprehensive solution to collegiate clients by providing new NIL revenue streams. Through this collaboration with drive21, a portion of the facility’s expenditure can be reallocated to the universities’ NIL efforts. This allows universities to offer a more engaging experience for athletes and fans while creating dynamic environments supporting athletic performance, fan engagement and brand partnerships.

"drive21’s ability to seamlessly integrate brand experiences into our facilities is a game-changer for our clients,” said Mark Donley, Chief Revenue Officer at Van Wagner College. “Through our arrangement with drive21, our university clients have an opportunity to access the expertise of drive21 to not only enhance their facilities but also ensure a consistent and high-quality experience for a variety of initiatives at an advantageous rate. It's truly a win-win-win scenario."

The first major joint effort was a collaboration at Florida International University for the brand implementation of the newly named Pitbull Stadium. drive21 and Van Wagner played a key role in creating cohesive branding for the first college athletic venue named after a musician, exampling the transformative potential of experiential design and strategic branding.
