# Texicare Partners with TempoPay to Make Paying For Health Care Simpler and More Accessible for Small Business Groups in Texas

TempoPay, a flexible payment solution that helps bridge the affordability gap in health care, and Texicare, the health affiliate of Texas Mutual, today announced that employees of small business groups selecting Texicare health plans can now access TempoPay to help manage everyday healthcare expenses.

TempoPay, a subsidiary of HPS/PayMedix, is a flexible payments platform that provides employees with the ability to pay their health care bills over time without interest, fees or credit checks. The TempoPay Visa® card can be used to pay for everything from medical care and prescriptions to vision and dental bills and other health and wellness-related costs not covered by employees’ plans.

Texicare members can sign up to access $1,500 in interest-free financing through TempoPay any time and have the flexibility to choose repayment terms. By building this unique financial tool into the health plan, members can manage their out-of-pocket expenses in a way that works for them, keeping health care and well-being within the household budget.

“For many Texans, out-of-pocket expenses are a barrier to getting needed care,” said Meredith Duncan, CEO of Texicare. “That’s why we’re partnering with TempoPay—to make health care more accessible for all our members so they can focus first and foremost on their well-being and manage their out-of-pocket costs in a way that works for them. Together, we are aligned in our mission to build a healthier, happier Texas.”

Texicare aims to change the health care ecosystem by providing small businesses with innovative solutions that increase access to high-quality care. Texicare’s health plans are designed with the employee experience in mind—they are easy to use and focused on the holistic well-being of employees and their families. The addition of TempoPay will enhance these offerings and open access to small businesses across Texas, allowing employees to access health care when they need it.

“TempoPay is a perfect fit for Texas employers who can now offer their employees a flexible way to pay for their health care expenses, and we are proud to be partnering with Texicare,” Erika Davison-Aviles, Co-founder of TempoPay said. “Through this partnership, we accelerate our mission to help hardworking people and their families get care when they need it and make health care accessible for all."
