The crypto market was recently shaken after analyst Altcoin Sherpa made a bold Solana (SOL) price prediction. Meanwhile, KangaMoon (KANG) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are soaring in the meme coin space. In fact, numerous analysts claim that KANG, which is now in Stage 5 of its presale, could become the next 100x meme coin in 2024. Today, we find out why.

Altcoin Sherpa: The Solana Price Could Surge to $500 Solana (SOL) has been showing some volatility in the market. CoinMarketCap data shows that the price of SOL fell from $154 to $133 on the one-week chart. In that time, the Solana market cap also moved between $68B and $59B. However, crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa remains bullish. In his new tweet, he predicts SOL's growth to $500 this year.

From a technical analysis standpoint, this prediction could come true. For example, the Solana coin trades above its 100 and 200-day EMAs. As a result, experts have made a bullish Solana price prediction - reaching $177 before the end of Q2 2024.

KangaMoon (KANG): Among the Best Meme Coins To Buy As Solana steals all attention, other cryptos are still making headlines. KangaMoon (KANG) is one coin that has shone with its stellar presale performance. Notably, this meme coin has already raised over $6M and will reach $7M before May 2024 ends. There are now over 6K KANG holders and 20K registered community members.

Evidently, global traders are interested in this meme coin since it will bring something new - utility. KANG will be the main in-game currency for KangaMoon's upcoming P2E game. With this meme coin, you can buy in-game items as well as upgrade characters. This utility immediately separates KANG from 99% of other meme coins, which are hype-driven only.

Another aspect that makes KangaMoon different is its community-driven focus. For instance, KangaMoon rewards its most active community members with free KANG tokens before its launch. Thus, 20K members rush to like/share/comment on KangaMoon's social media posts and earn this meme coin for free.

Early buyers of KANG have already experienced a 290% ROI as KANG costs $0.0196 in Stage 5 of its presale. But remember that KangaMoon has ties to the P2E gaming market, which may reach $885M by 2028. This means that KANG's long-term growth potential is outstanding. Experts foresee a 100x jump once this meme coin gets a Tier-1 CEX listing in Q2 of 2024.

Analyst Kevin Makes a Bullish Dogecoin Price PredictionMeanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE) is another meme coin that is seeing some bullish signs. For example, the Dogecoin volume has jumped 26% in the past week alone. In that period, the price of DOGE fluctuated between $0.15 and $0.13. Based on the historical performance, analyst Kevin predicts that this meme coin may soar to $3.80.

The technical analysis for the Dogecoin crypto also shows bullish signals. For example, DOGE is trading above its 100 and 200-day EMAs. Thus, experts foresee a rise to $0.21 for Dogecoin within Q2 of 2024.

Solana vs. KangaMoon vs. Dogecoin - Which One Rises First?In the battle between Solana, KangaMoon, and Dogecoin, the spotlight shines on KangaMoon. This is because KANG boasts a low market cap of $19.6M, hinting at its potential for explosive growth with fewer new funds needed for its price to skyrocket. If you want this meme coin, sign up for its presale and get a 10% bonus.
