Francis MacDonald, CEO of Li-FT Power (OTC: LIFFF) (CVE: LIFT), was recently a guest on Benzinga’s All-Access.

Li-FT is a mineral exploration company engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of lithium pegmatite projects in Canada. The company’s flagship project is the Yellowknife Lithium Project located in the Northwest Territories.

Li-FT also holds three early-stage exploration properties in Quebec, Canada, which it says have excellent potential for the discovery of buried lithium pegmatites, and also the Cali Project in the Northwest Territories within the Little Nahanni Pegmatite Group.

The company recently released data gathered from the Yellowknife Project showing high concentrations of lithium.
