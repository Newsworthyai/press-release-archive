# Sky Quarry Inc. Announces Commencement of Reg A Offering

Sky Quarry Inc. (“Sky Quarry,” “SQI,” or the “Company”), an integrated energy solutions company committed to revolutionizing the waste asphalt shingle recycling industry is pleased to announce the launch of its Regulation A (Reg A) investment round. This move comes ahead of the Company’s planned Nasdaq listing, for which they have already secured the ticker 'SKYQ'.

Waste-to-Energy Solutions

Key to Sky Quarry’s success is the Company’s innovative approach to energy recovery from waste asphalt shingles (“WAS”). Nearly 6 million homes in the USA are reroofed each year, sending approximately 15 million tons of asphalt shingles to landfills across the country for disposal, contributing to a significant environmental challenge, not to mention a waste of valuable resources.

Sky Quarry has developed a patented process to transform this waste into sustainable fuels and other marketable materials – a total of 7 potential revenue streams. Their model capitalizes on both a low-cost commodity and the global shift towards eco-friendly solutions.

The Company’s many addressable markets are expected to be worth a combined $25B by 2035. This Reg A round is an opportunity for investors to join the operation as management executes their expansion strategy .

Market Expansion & Growth Trajectory

Part of Sky Quarry’s fully integrated strategy was the acquisition of two substantial processing facilities: a cutting-edge oil extraction facility in Utah with significant hydrocarbon resources, and a 5,000 barrel a day oil refinery in Nevada. These acquisitions provide them with an integrated capability from extraction to refining.

In 2023 their refinery generated over $50 million in revenue and the Company is set to put into production their fully retrofitted flagship extraction facility in 2025, which is designed to produce up to 2,000 barrels of sustainable oil daily. Management believes that this facility will further cement Sky Quarry's role in the rise of renewable energy solutions.

David Sealock, Chairman, CEO, and Co-founder, states, “At Sky Quarry, our mission is not only to think differently, but to challenge the status quo in not one but two industries – energy and waste management. Today, we’ve built an energy company which we believe is unlike any other, one which provides a simple solution for sustainable energy from a significant waste issue.”

A Planned Nasdaq Listing

This opportunity is being offered pursuant to Regulation A by Digital Offering, LLC, an SEC registered broker-dealer, and member of FINRA and SIPC. Investors are encouraged to carefully review the Offering Circular and its related risk factors and exhibits prior to investing.

The capital raised will help propel the Company's expansion efforts and support its strategic move towards a planned Nasdaq listing, where Sky Quarry will trade under the ticker symbol 'SKYQ.'
