# Athleisure and Luxury Fuse to Lead Consumer Trends

Modern consumer fashion trends have been highlighted by growth in a space where athleisure meets luxury. Nowhere has this trend been more pronounced than in Lululemon’s (NASDAQ: LULU) decade long surge to leadership amongst multi-generational consumers seeking an active casual lifestyle, while clearly stating, “this look didn’t come cheap.” Despite brand maturity, this movement has allowed Lululemon to post double digit growth in revenue and earnings, whereas competitor Nike (NYSE:NKE) failed to post single digit revenue growth and saw a slight reduction in their earnings YOY, yet maintained strong positive cash flow and profitability.

Recently athleisure or the ideology that a successful trendsetter balancing career, family and health goals isn’t confined to just fashion apparel and has spilled over into the consumer’s personal electronics choices and outdoor recreation equipment and apparel. On the personal electronics front, AXIL Brands Inc. (NYSE American: AXIL) has leveraged their approach to multi-functional fashionable Bluetooth ear buds with built in hearing protection and enhancement to complement the athleisure trend, making their way into the 2024 Paris Summer Olympic Games, NASCAR stadiums, personal fitness routines, and concert venues, among other indoor and outdoor leisure activities, and recently posting triple digit earnings growth last quarter and high double digit revenue growth for the last two years. YETI Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: YETI) has entered the athleisure space by defining high quality luxury coolers and utilizing their branding success to pivot into high quality apparel, among other offerings complimentary to the freedom offered by outdoor healthy living activities. YETI’s pivot has kept them on trend with Lululemon’s double digit revenue and earnings growth, and all of these companies have built on the common theme that quality offerings designed to enhance quality of life lead to a healthier bottom line and a healthier consumer.
