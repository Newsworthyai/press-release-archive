In Mexico's current credit market, many loan products have fixed terms, often leaving users with inflexible repayment schedules. This rigidity can increase the burden on borrowers and may result in costly late fees. Lana Digital's Revolving Line of Credit addresses these challenges by offering a more adaptable solution.

With Lana Digital's Revolving Line of Credit, users can borrow and repay funds within a specified timeframe without needing to reapply. Interest is charged only on the amount borrowed and for the days it is used. If users repay the loan early, they benefit from reduced interest costs. This flexibility allows users to tailor their repayment plans to their financial circumstances, providing greater financial convenience and autonomy. The "pay-as-you-go" model also underscores Lana Digital's commitment to prioritizing and safeguarding its users' interests.

Grace Zamora, Head of Operations at Lana Digital, stated: "Our new credit product will offer greater convenience to Mexican users. By simplifying the loan process and providing flexible repayment options, we aim to offer the financial support that more Mexicans need, irrespective of their background or financial status."
