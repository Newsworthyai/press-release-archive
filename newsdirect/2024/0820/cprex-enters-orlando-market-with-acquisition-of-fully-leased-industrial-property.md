# CPREX Enters Orlando Market with 
Acquisition of Fully-Leased Industrial Property

![](https://public.newsdirect.com/146505197/m116r0Ba.jpg)

Clarion Partners Real Estate Income Fund Inc. (“CPREX” or the “Fund”) announced today it has acquired Regional Airport Center II, an 81,762-square-foot industrial building located in Orlando, FL that is 100% leased to 11 tenants.

Clarion Partners, the third largest owner of industrial real estate in the U.S., has been active in the industrial and logistics sector for more than two decades. The firm maintains strong conviction in the sector, with this purchase bringing the total amount of industrial space owned by CPREX investors to more than 33% of the Fund1, and Clarion’s total U.S. industrial footprint to approximately 256 million square feet.

“The purchase of Regional Airport Center II, well-located approximately five miles west of the Orlando International Airport in the Southeast Orange County submarket, brings Clarion’s overall industrial investment in the broader Orlando market to 29 buildings and over five million square feet,” said Managing Director Brent Jenkins. “Clarion also has nearly three million square feet of industrial projects in its development pipeline in the Orlando area.”

Clarion is part of Franklin Templeton’s alternatives business, which spans a broad range of strategies, including real estate, private credit, hedge funds and secondary private equity and co-investments with approximately $255 billion in assets under management as of June 30, 2024. Clarion Partners serves as CPREX’s sub-adviser and Franklin Templeton through different entities serves as the adviser, administrator and distributor of the Fund.

“CPREX’s overarching goal is to provide individual investors access to Clarion’s longstanding institutional platform through a simple, accessible, and transparent structure registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended,” said Product Specialist Ali Winrow. “Positive net investor inflows over the past 18 months have enabled the fund to not only bolster its liquidity, but also leverage its flexible investment mandate through new equity and debt investments. Quarterly tender requests over the past 18 months have averaged about 1.7% of net asset value (NAV). Tender requests peaked in the second quarter of 2023 at 2.9% of NAV, remaining well below the 5% of NAV liquidity offered to investors in every quarter since the Fund’s inception.”

In addition, CPREX maintains a daily value backed by one of the most robust valuation policies in the industry whereby each investment in its portfolio is valued by a third-party appraiser monthly and adjusted for income daily so that the stock price equates to the underlying value of each asset.

Source: Clarion Partners. As of August 19, 2024. This investment represents 2.34% of relative percentage of the holding of the entire portfolio (100%). Characteristics and holdings weightings are based on total portfolio, are subject to change at any time, and are provided for informational purposes only. Not to be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. There can be no assurance that any unrealized investment described herein will prove to be profitable. Please refer to the important disclosures at the end of this presentation.

Investment Risks: All investments involve risk, including loss of principal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Liquidity Risk Considerations: The Fund should be viewed as a long-term investment, as it is inherently illiquid and suitable only for investors who can bear the risks associated with the limited liquidity of the Fund. Limited liquidity is provided to shareholders only through the Fund’s quarterly repurchase offers for no more than 5% of the Fund’s shares outstanding at net asset value. There is no guarantee these repurchases will occur as scheduled, or at all. Shares will not be listed on a public exchange, and no secondary market is expected to develop. Shareholders may not be able to sell their shares in the Fund at all or at a favorable price.

Risks related to investment made by the Fund: The Fund’s investments are highly concentrated in real estate investments, and therefore will be subject to the risks typically associated with real estate, including but not limited to local, state, national or international economic conditions; including market disruptions caused by regional concerns, political upheaval, sovereign debt crises and other factors. Asset-backed, mortgage-backed or mortgage-related securities are subject to prepayment and extension risks. The Fund and/or its subsidiaries employ leverage, which increases the volatility of investment returns and subjects the Fund to magnified losses if an underlying fund’s investments decline in value. The Fund may use derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance. Fixed income securities involve interest rate, credit, inflation and reinvestment risks. As interest rates rise, the value of fixed income securities fall. High-yield bonds possess greater price volatility, illiquidity and possibility of default.

Before investing, carefully consider a Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. You can find this and other information in each prospectus, or summary prospectus, if available, at www.franklintempleton.com. Please read it carefully.
