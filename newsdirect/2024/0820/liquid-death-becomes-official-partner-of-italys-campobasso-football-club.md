# Liquid Death Becomes Official Partner of Italy’s Campobasso Football Club

Liquid Death, the healthy beverage platform and one of the fastest-growing non-alcoholic brands, is now the official water and flavored sparkling water partner of Italy’s Campobasso Football Club (Campobasso), which is co-owned by Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos, Emmy Award-winning hosts of LIVE with Kelly & Mark, the top-rated talk show in the United States. Liquid Death was unveiled as a partner of Campobasso in late July on LIVE, with a guest appearance and jersey swap by Ryan Reynolds. The Deadpool star was gifted the new Liquid Death branded Campobasso FC jersey by Consuelos while exchanging a Wrexham A.F.C. jersey, the Welsh club which has gained global popularity through its “Welcome to Wrexham” series on FX.

“The Campobasso journey has been a fairytale over the past two years, taking this club from the bottom to winning two consecutive promotions for the first time in our 100-plus year history,” said Consuelos. “Much in the same way Liquid Death has built one of the boldest brands on the planet right now, we built Campobasso with precision, fearlessness and by dreaming big. Campobasso FC has now arrived and is ready to play on big stages, and what better brand to partner with than Liquid Death, who has taken on the giants and won just as we intend to do on the pitch.”

As part of a multi-year agreement that makes Liquid Death the official water partner of Campobasso FC, fans will see Liquid Death at all Campobasso FC concession stands, on stadium signage, on special edition jerseys, and wrapped around the team's tour bus. Liquid Death will also collaborate on LED ad boards, the player tunnel walkway, product kiosks, unique activations, and events for Campobasso FC fans in North America, and more.

“This is our first venture into European football, and we couldn't be more excited for it," said Ryan Heuser, Liquid Death’s senior vice president of experiential marketing. “We’re thrilled to bring our infinitely recyclable, ice-cold cans of Liquid Death to the highly passionate fans of Southern Italy’s historical club. We’ll be on the road with the team as the exclusive sponsor of the team bus and carried at all concession stands at the Molinari Avicor Stadium in Campobasso.”

Matt Rizzetta, Chairman of North Sixth Group, parent company and operator of Campobasso FC, oversaw the revival of the team from near obscurity, with only 70 fans at matches during its first game in 2022, to attracting 30,000 fans for its celebration upon the club’s triumphant promotion to Serie C in 2024.

“The partnership between Camopbasso FC and Liquid Death brings together two of today’s feel-good underdog stories in sports and water,” said Matt Rizzetta, Chairman of North Sixth Group, parent company of Campobasso FC. “With Mike Cessario and Liquid Death, our journeys intersect in many ways and share the same values of perseverance, courage, and overcoming the odds. We couldn’t think of a better partner with whom to join hands as we both write the next chapter in our respective underdog stories.”

Located between Rome and Naples in the region of Molise, Campobasso carries a proud football tradition that dates back more than 100 years. The team has one of the most passionate followings in central and southern Italy, having beaten some of the most successful teams in Italian football such as Juventus, AC Milan, and Lazio, during its glory years of the 1980’s.

In 2022, fans of Campobasso were at risk of losing football completely after the team was denied entrance to the professional leagues. On the brink of losing all hope of competing in Italian football, North Sixth Group acquired Campobasso along with Ripa and Consuelos, restarting from the fifth tier of the Italian football pyramid. Since acquiring the club, Campobasso has won two consecutive championships and has been promoted to Serie C, the third tier of Italian professional football.

Liquid Death uses comedy and entertainment to promote both sustainability and healthy products. Liquid Death’s social following captures more than 9.5 million followers across TikTok and Instagram, making it the third most followed beverage brand globally. The company donates a portion of proceeds to nonprofits as part of their partnership with 5Gyres and the Thirst Project.
