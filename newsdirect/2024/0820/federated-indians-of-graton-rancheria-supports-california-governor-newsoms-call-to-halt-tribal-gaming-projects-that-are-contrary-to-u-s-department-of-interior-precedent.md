# Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria Supports California Governor Newsom’s Call to Halt Tribal Gaming Projects That Are Contrary to U.S. Department of Interior Precedent

California Governor Gavin Newsom’s Office urged the Department of the Interior not to move forward with new casino projects proposed by the Koi Nation of Northern California and the Scotts Valley Band of Pomo Indians at locations outside of their aboriginal homelands.

In a letter to Assistant Secretary Bryan Newland, the Governor’s Office notes that both projects are far outside the aboriginal territory of the Koi Nation and the Scotts Valley Band and the Department of the Interior has failed to consider reasonable alternative locations within their Lake County homelands.

The Governor’s Office also expressed concern that the Department of the Interior could stretch the limits of what is allowed under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to move these proposed casino projects forward, sidestepping the state and ignoring the concerns of other tribes and local communities.

“The Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria appreciates Governor Newsom’s support in protecting tribal sovereignty against Interior’s unexplained rush to move these projects forward while ignoring the concerns of local tribes,” said Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria Chairman Greg Sarris. “We have repeatedly explained to Interior that these projects will have devastating impacts to the rights and cultural resources of our Tribe and others in whose ancestral territory these prospective projects are located. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland has ultimate responsibility for these decisions and needs to ensure that Interior is working to protect the interests of all tribes.”
