# Avenue Z Announces Strategic Partnerships with TikTok Shops and Shopify: Driving New Advancements in Social Commerce

Heading into the crucial Q4 holiday retail season, Avenue Z, a media and technology company, announced its strategic partnerships with TikTok Shops and Shopify. These collaborations amplify Avenue Z’s cutting-edge approach, highlighting its role as an official TikTok Shops Agency Partner and Shopify Plus Partner, delivering unmatched benefits to shoppers, creators, and brands.

Avenue Z, a leader in social commerce, is renowned for its ability to drive influence across all channels, where Shopify’s e-commerce platform and TikTok Shops’ affiliate and influencer marketing abilities are a critical part. “Shopify and TikTok Shops are the key drivers paving the new path that is social commerce” said David Corchado, Chief Strategy Officer at Avenue Z, and Head of Channel Partnerships. “They continue to innovate store functionality and enhance the on-platform shopper experience. Now with the prioritization of TikTok Live content, any DTC / B2C brand heading into the holiday retail season must have these two pieces in their e-commerce ecosystem, or they’ll miss the mark on Q4 performance.” This partnership provides direct access to TikTok Shop expertise, along with insights from Shopify and Shopify Plus experts, all designed to optimize the shopping experience, boost revenue, and enhance brand reputation. Avenue Z will also be working with brands on TikTok to stream “LIVE” content allowing viewers and creators to interact in real-time.

Easy Access to TikTok Shop Expertise for Brands

With over 150 million monthly active users in the US, TikTok is revolutionizing social commerce. Avenue Z’s status as a preferred TikTok Shops Partner (TSP) allows brands to tap into platform expertise and support to leverage viral marketing trends, transforming product discovery into instant purchasing decisions. This collaboration enables brands to easily engage with TikTok’s dynamic audience through Avenue Z’s expertise and creator network, leveraging real-time analytics and advanced tools to maximize sales and brand presence.

“Affiliate and influencer marketing have evolved and merged into a highly effective strategy for performance marketing,” said Jonathan Snow, Chief Innovation Officer at Avenue Z, in a recent Fast Company article. “Brands can make the most of this by engaging a large number of affiliates and offering attractive commissions, all through the TikTok Shop platform. Paired with our platform expertise, social commerce will be a critically important revenue generating channel for brands in Q4.”

Shopify Expertise for eCommerce Brands

As a Shopify Plus Partner, Avenue Z helps brands optimize their digital storefronts and expand their reach, driving growth in a competitive marketplace. With Shopify, brands can manage and grow their online presence across multiple channels, ensuring a seamless shopping experience that meets the evolving preferences of today’s consumers.

“This is why our Shopify Plus Partner status is so important, we’re able to bring the best in e-commerce to our clients,” said Snow. “Shopify has the world’s highest converting checkout experience, augmented by Shop Pay which expedites the payment process and offers consumers rewards and cashback. Thanks to this, Shopify Payments represents a staggering 61% of Shopify’s GMV, which climbed $2B in Q2 2024 (YoY), and was able to do so despite unfavorable consumer market conditions. When the tide turns and we enter a stronger consumer market in the near future, just imagine what Shopify’s growth will accelerate to.” Snow’s outlook for DTC/B2C brand performance in Q4 2024 remains strong, but only when best-in-class e-commerce tools and talent align, as is the case with Avenue Z’s Shopify Plus Partnership.

Biggest Brand Benefits: Driving Revenue, Elevating Reputation

As Avenue Z continues to pioneer advancements in social commerce, the strategic partnerships with TikTok Shops and Shopify mark a significant milestone.

“Channels like this - TikTok and Shopify - are critical avenues for driving influence today, for brands looking to elevate reputation or increase revenue,” said Jeffrey Herzog, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Avenue Z. “They are top performers in our channel network, excelling at driving commerce, connections, and conversions for our clients. We will undoubtedly expand in this area by adding more channels and expertise in the coming months."

These partnerships highlight Avenue Z's continuous effort to stay at the forefront of innovation, ensuring that their clients can leverage the latest technological advancements to captivate and engage audiences across all channels.
