Bitcoin (BTC) has made headlines by surging above $90k after pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump won the US presidency. Following Bitcoin’s stellar performance, meme coins have started rallying in massive numbers, which means that meme season 2.0 is effectively starting now.

A newcomer in the meme space, Cutoshi, is making waves with its unique utility and intriguing reward system, prompting many BTC holders to rotate profits into the viral presale of the native $CUTO token. Let’s discover why Cutoshi could revolutionize meme coins and bring massive price multipliers to early buyers.

Bitcoin Teasing Another Run Above $90KBitcoin (BTC) has once again surprised everyone over the past week by adding $20k to its previous $72k all-time high in a matter of days. This explosion in the Bitcoin price was mainly due to the “Trump Pump” as the crypto community calls the Trump effect on the crypto market.

At press time, Bitcoin sells for $89,784 with a noteworthy 32% monthly increase and an 18% weekly increase. These numbers are impressive given the sheer size of Bitcoin’s market cap of $1.7 trillion, which requires immense amounts of liquidity for the price of BTC to rise higher.

Despite Bitcoin traders taking home over $8 billion in profit in the past two days, Bitcoin’s price action remains relatively stable. This is mainly due to the bullish sentiment pervading the crypto community, supported by a massive $129 billion in futures trading volume recorded on centralized exchanges.

Cutoshi Continues To Shine As Presale Nears $1 Million MilestoneCutoshi continues to rise as attention is shifting from majors to newer, undervalued projects that can yield massive price multipliers and mint new millionaires along the way. With another meme season ramping up, Cutoshi is set to see exponential gains thanks to its innovative framework that merges meme culture and DeFi utility.

Cutoshi draws inspiration from two sources — its vibe and aesthetic are based on the Lucky Cats of Japanese folklore that are said to bring good fortune to businesses and households. Additionally, by embodying the values of privacy and decentralization, Cutoshi also echoes the teachings of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.

At the heart of the Cutoshi ecosystem, users will find CUTO DEX, a cutting-edge decentralized exchange that brings together isolated blockchains, allowing for seamless P2P transactions that jump the middleman. This means near-instant swaps across a wide range of assets with low fees.

One of Cutoshi’s most intriguing features is the Cuto Farm system, powered by the $CUTO token. Users can immediately participate by completing fun missions and quests that are aimed at establishing Cutoshi’s presence in the crypto space. For their loyalty and efforts, they will receive Cuto points that can later be redeemed for more $CUTO once the token launches. Moreover, by staking their tokens and supporting the ecosystem, users will also have the opportunity to earn recurring rewards on autopilot.

Another star feature that sets Cutoshi apart from the competition is the unique Cutoshi Academy. This is a learning hub that will lend a helping hand to beginners and teach them the fundamentals of DeFi, trading, and portfolio management. This initiative has already been praised as it greatly lowers entry barriers and demystifies aspects of the often confusing crypto world.

Right now, stage 3 of the presale is live and $CUTO tokens are priced at $0.0259. At $850,000 in raised funds, demand is skyrocketing, with investors flocking to get an allocation at a discounted price. When taking into account all that this gem has to offer, it’s realistic to expect a monumental 2025 rally that could Cutoshi outperform many established majors such as Shiba Inu and Dogwifhat. Don’t miss out!
