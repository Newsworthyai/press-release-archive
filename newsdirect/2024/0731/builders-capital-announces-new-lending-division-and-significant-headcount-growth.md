# Builders Capital Announces New Lending Division and Significant Headcount Growth

Builders Capital, the nation’s leading provider of real estate financing to private homebuilders, today announced that it has significantly expanded its loan production operations with the addition of more than 40 new team members. The new lending division will originate loans focused on the local and regional real estate investor markets with loan sizes between $100K-$3MM.

The team will be led by Jonathan Andrews, previously COO of Upright (formerly Fund That Flip), and will operate under the trade name Casa Lending, a nod to the division’s dedication to residential real estate and community development.

“We are thrilled to welcome over 40 new team members to the Builders Capital family,” said Robert Trent, CEO of Builders Capital. “This team comes with deep expertise in small balance fix and flip and ground up construction with an innovative loan product suite dedicated to a market that Builders Capital has not yet tapped into. This strategic investment puts us in an extremely competitive position to capitalize on our goal of being the top private lender in the nation.”

“I am excited to be leading this new initiative for Builders Capital,” said Jonathan Andrews. “This is a market that has historically been underserved by banks and lacked efficient access to capital, which Builders Capital helps to solve. Working closely with local and regional real estate investors over the last decade, I’ve become very familiar with their unique challenges and goals. I'm looking forward to working with Rob and the team at Builders to scale this new opportunity with the highest levels of speed, customer service and execution.”

Builders Capital recently announced a $500 million transaction in growth capital with InterVest, which has helped propel the firm’s growth. As of 2024, Builders Capital has surpassed $10 billion in originated loans across the nation. Learn more about the new division Casa Lending at www.casalending.com.
