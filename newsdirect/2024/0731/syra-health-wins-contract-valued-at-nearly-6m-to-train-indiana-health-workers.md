Syra Health Corp. (NASDAQ: SYRA), has been awarded a $5.8 million contract to train professionals who deliver healthcare to Indiana residents at home or in a community-based setting under the purview of the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA). Headquartered in Carmel, Indiana, Syra Health was founded in 2020 and is focused on improving healthcare through innovative services and technology solutions.

At its core, the company is a healthcare technology company powering better health in challenging areas such as behavioral and mental health, digital health, and population health. Syra Health's offerings are centered on prevention, improved access, and affordable care.

In securing this new contract, Syra Health says it will deliver curriculum development, competency assessments, a sophisticated learning management system (LMS), a comprehensive training registry, and a dynamic quality improvement plan, all to fulfill FSSA's vision of "ensuring all home and community support professionals serving any population under a home and community-based settings waiver have the same competencies and training."

In speaking about being selected for this new contract, Dr. Deepika Vuppalanchi, CEO of Syra Health, stated, “We are proud to have been selected to implement statewide home and community support professionals training as part of this important program administered by FSSA. In recent months, we have seen a surge in demand for our off-the-shelf training services, and we look forward to providing additional health training services across the country.”

Syra Health’s curriculum reflects important gold-standard learning models and over 200 years of experience. It has module-specific learning objectives and interactive activities across the foundational, fundamentals, medication administration, and micro-credentials curricula. These areas, aligned with state-defined core competencies, integrate health equity and cultural competency principles aimed at supporting home and community support professionals of all backgrounds.

Syra Health’s training registry will track the utilization of the training materials and will be integrated into the LMS. As such, it will be able to provide a snapshot of workforce capacity and competency at any given moment in time.

Effective monitoring and reporting will also be a critical aspect of this project. Syra Health says it will be providing regular comprehensive reports to the FSSA and modifying the process to meet any evolving monitoring or reporting needs.
