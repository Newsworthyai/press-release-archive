# From Demand to Delivery: ToolsGroup Transforms SLF Greece's Supply Chain

ToolsGroup and its Greek partner, THellas, announced that SLF Greece -a distributor of KIKO MILANO products in Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria, and Romania- has implemented ToolsGroup SO99+ software. This move automates their omnichannel supply chain planning and shifts them from a supply-driven to a demand-driven model.

SLF uses ToolsGroup SO99+ to plan daily forecasting, inventory optimization, and replenishment for approximately 2500 active items across more than 30 retail stores and two distribution centers in its Greece and Cyprus network, with plans to expand to Bulgaria and Romania. Two central planners manage demand across SLF's sales channels, including physical stores and online sales, generating optimal inventory and purchasing proposals from suppliers and inter-location stock transfers.

“ToolsGroup's global leadership and local presence in Greece made SO99+ the clear choice for our advanced supply chain needs” stated Tilemachos Stylianos, Chief Development Officer of Fais Group. “Combined, these two factors gave us confidence for a successful project, right from our first introductory meetings. Having now gone live with the solution, we are very pleased with our choice, and we look forward to bringing significant contributions to the performance of our supply chain with this project.”

Through this transformation project with THellas, SLF has achieved a highly automated, demand-driven planning process, increased visibility, and optimized inventory levels throughout its network. THellas customized SO99+ to provide systems integration and tailored capabilities, including assortment plans and minimum presentation quantities at the location-couvet level. The implementation supports the creation of ideal inventory targets compared to current operational levels and business parameters, using SO99+ modeling to demonstrate financial optimization opportunities.

“The system has revolutionized our operations, automating daily store replenishment plans for Greece and Cyprus, while generating purchase recommendations for our team. Strategically, it helps us identify optimal inventory targets, balancing our current practices with supply chain limitations. SO99+'s success has motivated us to expand SO99+ to our other operating countries” noted Goldie Panovlepi, General Manager at SLF, highlighting the solution's benefits. “Our collaboration with THellas during the SO99+ implementation was exceptional. They provided invaluable insights on optimizing the system's setup and seamlessly integrating it with our ERP. SO99+ has proven to be a powerful yet user-friendly tool, offering high automation alongside transparent decision-making processes.”

Stathis Nikolakopoulos, Managing Director at THellas added on their successful go-live: “We're honored to collaborate with SLF's commercial and IT teams on this project. Fais Group's trust in THellas and ToolsGroup solutions for their planning process transformation underscores our position in Greece's retail sector. Modeling complex business environments and optimizing millions of daily planning decisions is challenging, requiring expertise and advanced tools. We're proud of our success and excited to deepen our partnership with Fais Group, driving even better results for their customers.”

Mauro Adorno, VP Global Alliances and Indirect Sales at ToolsGroup adds: “The successful implementation of ToolsGroup technology at SLF Greece exemplifies our commitment to transforming supply chain planning. This project demonstrates how ToolsGroup's solutions, combined with local expertise provided by our partner THellas, can deliver significant value to retailers facing complex supply chain challenges.”
