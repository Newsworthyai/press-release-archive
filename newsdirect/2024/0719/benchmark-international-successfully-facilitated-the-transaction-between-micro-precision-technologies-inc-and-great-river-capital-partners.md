Benchmark International has successfully facilitated the transaction between Salem, NH-based Micro-Precision Technologies, Inc. (“MPT”) and Boston, MA-based Great River Capital Partners (“Great River”). MPT designs and manufactures high-performance microelectronics for harsh environments and high-reliability applications. The company’s offerings primarily include thick-film ceramic substrates, hybrid micro-electronic manufacturing, and obsolete semiconductor manufacturing.

“The Benchmark International team understood early that MPT is a highly differentiated asset, given its Defense Logistics Agency standards certification and highly valuable niche manufacturing capabilities,” commented Benchmark Senior Transaction Director William Sullivan. “This opportunity garnered immediate interest from very high-quality buyers, as we knew it would. Ultimately, Great River proved to be the perfect fit, with its narrow focus on mid-sized industrial technology companies, highly competent team, and HQ and management sitting close to MPT’s home base. To extend the metaphor, we think this will be a home run for both teams, and we were proud to be a part of it.”

MPT serves the defense, industrial controls, commercial aviation, semiconductor capital equipment (semi-cap), communications equipment, and space & biological industries across the US and internationally. Founded in 2012 by Mr. Adrian Pyke, the company is one of only 30 worldwide certified by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to the MIL-PRF-38534 quality standard.

Great River Capital Partners is a private equity investment firm with a narrow focus on acquiring mid-sized industrial technology and services companies. Leveraging 30 years of collective investing experience, the firm partners with business owners to create long-term value through organic growth initiatives and strategic add-on acquisitions.
