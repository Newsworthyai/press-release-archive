# Tonix Pharmaceuticals Awarded potential 34 million dollar Contract with U.S. Department of Defence

Tonix Pharmaceuticals CEO Dr. Seth Lederman joined Steve Darling from Proactive to share exciting news about a significant achievement for the company. Tonix Pharmaceuticals has been awarded a potential contract worth up to $34 million over five years by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), an agency within the U.S. Department of Defense. This contract aims to develop small molecule broad-spectrum antiviral agents for the prevention or treatment of infections, thereby enhancing the medical readiness of military personnel in biological threat environments.

Dr. Lederman explained that Tonix’s program will concentrate on the optimization and development of its TNX-4200 program. The goal is to develop an orally available CD45 antagonist with broad-spectrum efficacy against various viral families through extensive preclinical evaluation. The program is expected to establish essential physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetics, and safety attributes to support an Investigational New Drug (IND) submission, ultimately funding a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical study.

The agreement with DTRA is a strategic move to address the DoD’s objective of protecting U.S. Joint Forces from potential biological weapon threats. The DoD announced in December 2022 that it aims to move beyond the traditional ‘one bug, one drug’ approach and is seeking broad-spectrum drugs, as predicting which viruses or how many may be deployed in a biological threat scenario is challenging.

Dr. Lederman emphasized that the collaboration with DTRA underscores Tonix Pharmaceuticals' commitment to advancing medical readiness and protection for military personnel. By developing a broad-spectrum antiviral agent, Tonix aims to provide a versatile and robust solution to potential viral threats, enhancing the preparedness and resilience of the U.S. military in diverse and unpredictable biological threat environments.

The TNX-4200 program’s focus on creating an effective, orally available antiviral agent highlights Tonix’s innovative approach to addressing complex medical challenges. The successful development of this broad-spectrum antiviral could significantly impact the way viral infections are managed in military and potentially civilian populations, offering a proactive measure against a wide array of viral threats.

Tonix Pharmaceuticals continues to be at the forefront of medical innovation, dedicated to developing cutting-edge solutions that meet the evolving needs of the healthcare and defense sectors. The support from the DoD through this substantial contract is a testament to the potential and importance of Tonix’s TNX-4200 program in safeguarding the health and readiness of military personnel against biological threats.
