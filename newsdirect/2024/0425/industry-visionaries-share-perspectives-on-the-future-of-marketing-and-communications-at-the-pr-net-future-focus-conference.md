'Reinventing Modern Media' panel featured industry leaders discussing the dynamic nature of media today. Samantha Barry, Glamour's Editor-in-Chief, emphasized the universality of good content, noting, “Sometimes, as a brand, we can go down a rabbit hole of ‘this is a Gen Z thing,’ or ‘this is only for millennial women,’ etc. Oftentimes, good content will reach them all, regardless of generation.” Amanda Smith, President of Fairchild Media, highlighted the importance of brand clarity, stating, “I think we're all being rewarded for having total clarity on who we are and what defines our brand IP. The more we can articulate that in the marketplace, the better off we’ll be.” Willa Bennett, Highsnobiety's Editor-in-Chief, emphasized the value of long-term content investment, saying, “If you invest long term, the traffic will come.” Simone Oliver, Strategic Advisor & Editor at Large, discussed the shift in content engagement and distribution, noting, “Engagement has been the clear winner in terms of how people engage with your content and what you're producing. You want people to see what you make, you want the message to get out there, but distribution has changed.” She also highlighted the evolving nature of content discovery, adding, “Discovery has a different face now.”

Bronson Van Wyck, Founder of Workshop and DIO, emphasized holistic experiences, stating, “You want to give someone an opportunity to return to the womb where every aspect of their needs, physical and emotional, are being taken care of.” Rachel Racusen, Senior Director of Corporate Communications and Public Affairs at Snap Inc., highlighted quality over quantity in media, noting, “If you have an amazing New York Times story that is meant to reach a certain audience and that's the only story you get on something, that could provide a lot more value than twenty stories.” Allison Barrie Rand, Head of Experiential Marketing & Talent Partnerships at Walmart, discussed the intangible nature of creating memories, noting, “We are fundamentally in the business of making memories. And that's hard to measure.” Rand also emphasized using technology to foster community and connection, stating, “Tech needs to be leveraged as a tool to help further enable community, to help further enable connection.” She cautioned against expecting every experience to achieve all objectives, stating, “When we expect every single experience that we do to boil the ocean of objectives, that's not going to get us so far.”
