# AmeriLife’s The Senior Resource Group Partners with Bobby Brock Insurance and Camas Prairie Insurance to Transform Medicare Choice

--News Direct--

The Senior Resource Group, (SRG), a leading, national field marketing organization (FMO) for the industry’s leading insurance carriers and an affiliate of AmeriLife Group, LLC (“AmeriLife”), announced today that it has entered into a partnership with Bobby Brock Insurance (BBI), a leading national health insurance agency and founding sponsor of MedicareCon, a highly regarded annual Medicare and health insurance conference for licensed and entrepreneurial health insurance agents.

In a separate but related deal, SRG also welcomed Camas Prairie Insurance (CPI), a central Idaho-based, family owned and operated health insurance agency and downline partner of Bobby Brock Insurance (which will continue to operate as such). Per both agreements, terms were not disclosed.

“We are so excited to partner with the Bobby Brock Insurance and Camas Prairie Insurance teams,” said Shane Souders, co-founder of The Senior Resource Group. “[BBI CEO] Justin is a trusted voice for the Medicare broker community and an incredible business leader, while [CPI owner] Josh Lustig is a great young leader and one of the best sales trainers and motivators in the business today. SRG, BBI and CPI, with the support of AmeriLife, are aligned with complementary skillsets that will make us one of the most dynamic Medicare agency partnerships in the country.”

Founded by Bobby Brock in 1992, Bobby Brock Insurance operates as a national brokerage firm and call center that specializes in ACA plans for the under-65 market, Medicare Supplement plans, Medicare Part D plans, and Medicare Advantage. In 2014, Bobby Brock’s son and the company’s current CEO, Justin Brock, left the Marine Corps to pursue a career as a licensed Medicare agent. The younger Brock saw a need to breathe fresh air into the marketing, service, and team building aspect of the industry, and quickly established a thriving culture and expanded value proposition for both agents and consumers with the concepts he learned as an Operator in the Marine Corps. Soon thereafter, he acquired his father’s book of business along with a number of other agencies, consolidating them under the Bobby Brock name in honor of his father.

Today, Bobby Brock Insurance is setting the industry standard. In 2023, it was named to the prestigious Inc. 5000 list as one of the fastest-growing private companies by revenue in the United States. The company has also won multiple industry awards for its one-stop insurance agency solution, GoGuru, and has become prolific in its use of social media to promote and foster the sharing of information between agents and brokers.

“Our industry needs agents and brokers to focus on consumers’ needs first,” said Justin Brock. “If we can work towards an environment that rewards quality outcomes while creating efficiencies that allow our sales representatives to replicate the process often and with ease, we can prove that there is no better distribution model than through licensed life and health insurance agents. We are confident that our synergies with AmeriLife, SRG, and CPI will amplify our ability to achieve that goal.”

Camas Prairie Insurance, a family-run, health brokerage established in 1996 by Dominic and Gina Lustig, primarily focuses on the Medicare and health insurance market. The company has experienced rapid growth over the past several years under the leadership of owner and CEO Josh Lustig, building upon a foundation centered on its “just do the next right thing” approach and an intense focus on educating clients on their health care needs.

“This partnership is a watershed moment in Camas Prairie Insurance’s history,” said Josh Lustig, who is also the founder of Thrive, a personal and business development seminar program focused on helping agents grow their business. “I truly believe that, together, we are building something incomparable in our space for today’s individual agent and agency owner, and I couldn’t ask for better partners on this journey than Shane, Justin, Bobby Bache and the entire team at AmeriLife.”

Now, as part of the AmeriLife family of companies, Bobby Brock Insurance and Camas Prairie Insurance will gain access to one of the industry’s largest independent health distribution platforms and a growing suite of products and solutions that is setting a standard for excellence in the industry.

“Today is an incredible day for The Senior Resource Group and AmeriLife,” said Scotty Elliott, Chief Distribution Officer of Health for AmeriLife. “I couldn’t be more excited to welcome two companies of their reputation and caliber to our growing distribution network. Together, our opportunities for growth are limitless.”

“One of the reasons I partnered with AmeriLife as an affiliate back in 2020 was for this very reason: to get to work with not only the best people in the industry, but people that have been my friends for years,” added Bobby Bache, vice president of Health Distribution for AmeriLife. “I’m thrilled to welcome Justin and Josh to AmeriLife and look forward to helping grow their respective businesses in new and exciting ways.”

Bobby Brock Insurance and Camas Prairie Insurance will continue to operate as stand-alone businesses out of their Tupelo, Miss., and Grangeville, Idaho offices, respectively, under the leadership of Brock and Lustig, who will be supported by Souders.
