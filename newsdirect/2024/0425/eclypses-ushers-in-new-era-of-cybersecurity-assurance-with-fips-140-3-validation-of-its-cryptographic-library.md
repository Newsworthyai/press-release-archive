# ECLYPSES USHERS IN NEW ERA OF CYBERSECURITY ASSURANCE WITH FIPS 140-3 VALIDATION OF ITS CRYPTOGRAPHIC LIBRARY

--News Direct--

Eclypses, a leader in end-point data protection, today announced that it has successfully secured the Federal Information Processing Standard 140-3 (FIPS 140-3) validation. The Eclypses Cryptographic Library (ECL), which acts as a key component inside its Secure MTE Technology, successfully passed a series of tests conducted by an independent NIST-accredited laboratory.

Eclypses is committed to providing its global customers with the most stringently reviewed technology to ensure their users’ data is protected. Secure MTE technology protects data at the application level, and provides endpoint verification, adhering to zero trust principles.

"Customers operating in a world of exponential and ever-changing cyber threats need to have trust that their enterprise and customer data is protected,” said David Gomes, chief executive officer, Eclypses. “Attaining FIPS 140-3 certification acknowledges Eclypses' relentless pursuit of excellence in data security. This certification validates our commitment to robust security protocols and paves the way for enhanced trust and reliability for our customers and partners."

About FIPS 140-3

Seen as the gold standard in data security, FIPS 140-3 validation proves that Eclypses’ Cryptographic Library effectively and consistently helps the Secure MTE Technology safeguard user data, ensuring that bad actors cannot access valuable information at any point during the data transmission process.

FIPS 140-3 is a U.S. government computer security standard used to approve cryptographic modules and covers a wide range of potential applications. With this validation from a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) approved testing laboratory, Eclypses Cryptographic Library (ECL) is now validated.

ECL houses all cryptographic algorithms used by Eclypses’ patented Secure MTE technology. Secure MTE provides true end-to-end payload protection through every aspect of a network, regardless of the configuration, and ensures that in the event of a breach, attackers cannot use the data to cause harm. This technology is an added layer of security at a low latency, complementing existing cyber security protocols with real-time speeds.

FIPS 140-3 validation gives Eclypses clients confidence that its technology is built upon the highest levels of trust and reliability.

“This validation signals a company has completed a strict review process and received validation from one of the most highly regarded security standards bodies in the world,” said Jefferson Dance, chief innovation officer, Eclypses. “With the FIPS 140-3 validation, Eclypses can continue to deliver data security for its finance, healthcare, retail, and critical infrastructure clients.”

In order to achieve FIPS 140-3 validation, cryptographic modules are subject to testing by NVLAP-accredited Cryptographic and Security Testing laboratories. The validation for Eclypses was performed by Penumbra Security, Inc.
