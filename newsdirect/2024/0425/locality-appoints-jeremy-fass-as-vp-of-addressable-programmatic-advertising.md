# Locality Appoints Jeremy Fass as VP of Addressable & Programmatic Advertising

--News Direct--

Locality, the industry’s preeminent local video solutions provider, today announces the appointment of Jeremy Fass as the company’s VP of Addressable & Programmatic Advertising. In this newly minted role, Fass will focus on leveraging technology, data, and Locality’s direct access to the industry’s highest quality CTV inventory to help marketers address qualified local audiences at scale through expanded programmatic channels. Moreover, Fass will play a critical role in helping publishers connect to premium demand outside their core national advertising sales focus.

Fass brings more than 15 years of experience in building audience-based marketplaces, solutions, and businesses for sell-side platforms and media companies alike to his new role. He will report directly to Steven DeMain, EVP of Sales at Locality.

Fass joins Locality from The Arena Group, where he was Senior Vice President, Head of Digital Advertising Revenue and led digital ad revenue and sales, account management, programmatic partnerships, and yield strategy. Prior to The Arena Group, Fass held extended leadership positions at publishing businesses such as Head of Programmatic Revenue and Addressable Advertising at New York Media, and Executive Director of enterprise partnerships at Condé Nast.

He spent the initial chapters of his career developing supply side businesses at industry leaders such as Meta and PubMatic, in the early days of exchange-based ad-monetization and consulted media owners on tools and platforms that enabled maximum distribution and monetization of their media assets.

“Jeremy’s arrival marks a pivotal moment for Locality,” said Steven DeMain. “His extensive experience in the digital advertising industry brings value to Locality as it continues to solidify itself in the industry as a trusted source to help marketers and publishers expand their local reach through premium inventory.”

“I’m thrilled to join Locality on its journey to unlocking the full potential of local TV advertising,” said Fass. “Locality is committed to being a trusted partner for advertisers, marketers, and publishers, and I’m incredibly excited to share my industry expertise with this team to guide clients to efficiently, and strategically, reach audiences in premium environments.”
