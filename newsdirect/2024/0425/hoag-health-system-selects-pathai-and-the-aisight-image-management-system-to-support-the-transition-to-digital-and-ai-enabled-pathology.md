# Hoag Health System Selects PathAI and the AISight Image Management System to Support the Transition To Digital and AI-enabled Pathology

--News Direct--

PathAI, a leading precision pathology company, today announced that Hoag Health System, the leading health system in the southern California region, will adopt the AISight Image Management System (IMS) as their primary platform, powering their transition to digital pathology. The transition from analog, glass-slide-based pathology to digital pathology continues to accelerate across anatomic pathology, globally. This transition is in part driven by the availability of AI pathology tools that harness machine learning (ML) algorithms to augment and assist the pathologist interpretation.

“The transition to digital pathology will unlock dramatic improvements in how care is provided to Hoag’s patients. By utilizing the most advanced image management system on the market with embedded algorithms, we expect to be able to deliver faster turnaround times to our physicians, more accurate and reproducible pathologist assessments, and expand our understanding of how biomarkers can drive optimal care decisions,” said Dr. Michael Brant-Zawadzki, MD, FACR, Hoag Vice President, Research Administration, CATALiST and Addiction.

AISight1 is a cloud-native intelligent enterprise workflow solution that is used by the world's leading laboratories and research centers to power their digital pathology workflows and AI applications. It serves as a central hub for case management, image management, and best-in-class artificial intelligence tools from PathAI and third-party partners, to enable a broad spectrum of histopathology use cases.

“Together with our partners, we will continue to pursue our vision to improve patient outcomes with AI-powered technology,” said Eric Walk, MD, FCAP, Chief Medical Officer, PathAI. “We are excited to partner with forward-thinking industry leaders like Hoag who embrace the science of what machine learning algorithms can offer healthcare professionals and how those learnings can augment and empower the important work of pathologists.”

According to Dr. John Cupp, MD, Director of Digital Pathology, Hoag Health System and PathAI Advisor, “Hoag is particularly excited to utilize PathAI’s ArtifactDetect algorithm that can improve pathology review, specifically to address pre-analytical factors that typically would delay pathologist review, as well as applying PathAI’s quantitative IHC scoring algorithms to support complex interpretation in PDL1 and HER2.”

Importantly, PathAI will collaborate with Hoag and their laboratory information system (LIS) provider to build a bi-directional integration between AISight and their Epic Beaker LIS instance to ensure a fully integrated pathologist experience.

“Computational pathology promises to unlock great potential for predictive biomarkers for patients with cancer,” said Dr. David R. Braxton, MD, Chief of Molecular Pathology Services, Hoag Family Cancer Institute. “This is an exciting next step in Hoag’s digital transformation as we continue to look ahead towards healthcare innovations that offer continual advancements in patient care, treatment efficacy, and overall public health outcomes.”
