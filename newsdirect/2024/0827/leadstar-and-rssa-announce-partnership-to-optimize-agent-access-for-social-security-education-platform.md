# LeadStar and RSSA Announce Partnership to Optimize Agent Access for Social Security Education Platform

LeadStar, the proprietary, private leads platform created with and exclusively for AmeriLife-affiliated agents, announced today that it has partnered with Registered Social Security Analysts (RSSA), a premier organization dedicated to advancing Social Security advisory skills, to offer a new feature to the ever-expanding LeadStar platform and its diverse offerings available.

The RSSA partnership is the latest addition to the LeadStar 2.0 platform, which provides a comprehensive set of lead delivery options and new seminar programming. RSSA’s Social Security education platform strengthens agents’ ability to build sales funnels, further their target lead generation outputs, fill seats at seminars, and foster an organic approach to Medicare sales opportunities.

“This partnership with RSSA represents a critical addition to LeadStar and is an incredible value-add for AmeriLife’s network of professionals looking to strengthen consumer trust, foster new relationships, build equity, and validate their service offering with their target audiences,” said William DeCourcy, Chief Lead Generation Officer for AmeriLife. "Alongside RSSA, we’re able to deliver educational opportunities to expand agents’ knowledge of Social Security benefits while simultaneously offering them enhanced targeting capabilities for their lead generation options to put this knowledge to greater use.”

Key benefits to AmeriLife-affiliated agents include training from Registered Social Security Analysts, who offer a specialized eLearning curriculum with the proprietary RSSA Roadmap Social Security optimization software to help agents navigate complex scenarios and optimize clients' retirement outcomes. Additionally, agents will have access to a library of resource materials, including case studies, white papers, and real-time updates on Social Security regulations, as well as certification opportunities that will distinguish them in their field and enhance their professional credibility.

"At RSSA, our mission is to empower professionals with the knowledge they need to guide their clients through one of the most critical aspects of retirement planning—Social Security,” said Ted Rosedale, Vice President of Strategy & Business Development for RSSA. “By partnering with LeadStar, we’re equipping AmeriLife-affiliated agents with the software and knowledge they’ll need to provide exceptional value to their clients. Together, we're not just enhancing lead generation; we're elevating the standard of care and advice consumers can expect when making pivotal retirement decisions."

AmeriLife-affiliated licensed agents interested in taking advantage of RSSA educational resources are encouraged to enroll in the eLearning curriculum. For more information about the partnership and to request information, please visit RSSA.com/LeadStar.
