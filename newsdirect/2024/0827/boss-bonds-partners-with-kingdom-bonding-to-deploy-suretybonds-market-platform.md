# BOSS Bonds Partners with Kingdom Bonding to Deploy SuretyBonds.Market Platform

BOSS Bonds Insurance Agency, a subsidiary of General Indemnity Group (GIG), announced today it has partnered with Kingdom Bonding of Fairfax, VA to deploy BOSS Bonds’ industry-leading SuretyBonds.Market (SBM) platform.

BOSS Bonds’ exclusive SBM platform is the leading technology solution for agents to deliver surety bond solutions to clients seamlessly. Industry experts meticulously crafted this advanced surety portal to streamline processes and enhance efficiency within the surety sector and throughout the surety value chain.

The platform allows agents to monitor and manage their clients’ bonds throughout every stage, from application and underwriting to issuance and renewals. The SBM portal is supported by the surety experts at BOSS Bonds, allowing agents like those at Kingdom Bonding to focus on their specialty, while offering their clients the best surety solutions on the market.

“We are excited that Kingdom Bonding has deployed SuretyBonds.market to unlock surety bond solutions for their construction and contractor customers,” said Rick Bredow, BOSS Bonds’ head of business development. “This partnership will allow Kingdom Bonding to better serve its customers online by putting advanced technology into the hands of insurance agents, allowing them to confidently capture more income in this often-overlooked segment of insurance.”

“BOSS Bonds was instrumental in helping in the success of Kingdom Bonding, whose focus is to help minority-led construction companies achieve generational wealth and break free from poverty cycles,” said Neb Aynu, founder and owner of Kingdom Bonding. “Our purpose is to educate, nurture and grow bonding opportunities for our contractors. This technology helps us do just that by making it easy and seamless for those in the construction space to acquire contractor license bonds and other types of bond products.”

Aynu also pointed out that the technology helps with better customer-facing and back-end systems for agents that provide all the support insurance agents selling bonds need. “The technology on the backend that BOSS Bonds offers allows our agency to perform operationally much more effectively and to better serve our customers. That coupled with actual live support offers a seamless bonding experience that only BOSS Bonds can offer.”

Aynu admits that there was a higher calling for him to start Kingdom Bonding and after a year in business, it is coming to pass, “There is a huge racial wealth gap in this country and what I can do is make an impact on that inequity by helping minority contractors understand how to get bonded and to do so easily so they can get more business.”
