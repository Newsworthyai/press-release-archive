# Davis Davis & Harmon Partners With Alteryx to Transform Sales Tax Consulting Practice

Demonstrating its commitment to technological leadership in the sales tax consulting sector, Davis Davis & Harmon LLC (DDH), the nation's largest woman- and minority-owned firm, today announced its strategic adoption of Alteryx, a leading enterprise analytics platform.

The adoption of Alteryx enhances DDH's robust data analytics capabilities and reinforces its position as an innovative service provider that leverages technology to address the dynamic needs of its clientele. The platform’s comprehensive data preparation and analytics tools establish repeatable workflows, freeing up DDH experts to focus on their value-added, sophisticated insights.

“Our clients rely on DDH to navigate their most challenging sales tax issues,” said Chanel Christoff Davis, Davis Davis and Harmon CEO and founder. “DDH will fully integrate Alteryx into its operations by the end of the year, and anticipate that it will significantly enhance our in-depth analysis and strategic advising, catalyzing our growth and delivering bottom-line results for clients.”

The combination of DDH's specialized expertise and Alteryx’s technological proficiency in managing high-volume, sophisticated data challenges positions DDH and its clients ahead of the digital transformation curve.

“By deploying Alteryx for tax automation and analytics, DDH is, once again, blazing new ground for the benefit of its clients and team members,” said Mike Tagtow, Sales Director at Alteryx partner, Capitalize Analytics.

DDH’s subject matter experts handle intricate transactions for Fortune 100 clients, who typically present much larger and more complex data sets. For example, DDH client Baker Hughes, one of the world’s largest energy companies, has fully transitioned to the new system. With Alteryx, DDH streamlined tax processing, identified potential tax savings and provided them with more accurate and timely tax advice.

“We fearlessly embrace technological advancements,” says Deon Harmon, Davis Davis and Harmon's Chief Growth Officer. “Just as we blaze trails for minority and women-owned businesses, we are harnessing the power of technology to transform the sales tax advisory industry.”
