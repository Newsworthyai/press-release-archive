# BrandPilot AI Launches Spectrum IQ to Revolutionize Influencer Marketing and Prepares for US Listing

BrandPilot AI CEO Brandon Mina joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce the launch of Spectrum IQ, an innovative web application designed to streamline the influencer marketing process for brands of all sizes. Spectrum IQ is a comprehensive platform that allows clients to search, analyze, and execute influencer marketing campaigns efficiently. It is a powerful tool that leverages AI technology to help brands identify the right influencers for their campaigns and track the results in real-time.

Mina explained that the new platform enables brands to search for influencers based on various criteria, including demographics, interests, and engagement rates. Users can access detailed influencer profiles that offer performance data and audience insights, facilitating the management of influencer campaigns from start to finish. This includes sending briefs, tracking progress, and measuring results, making it easier for brands to optimize their marketing strategies.

In addition to the launch of Spectrum IQ, BrandPilot AI has also announced that it has begun the initial filing of documentation for listing on the OTC Markets in the United States. The company anticipates that the listing process will be completed within the next 4-6 weeks. Once the listing is finalized, BrandPilot AI will commence its operations in the US under the symbol BPAIF on the OTC.

This dual announcement marks a significant milestone for BrandPilot AI as it expands its presence in the influencer marketing industry and prepares to enter the US market. The launch of Spectrum IQ, combined with the upcoming OTC listing, positions the company for growth and increased visibility in the rapidly evolving digital marketing landscape.
