# Text Patents a Method for Combining Asynchronous and Real-Time Communication

Text, a global leader in B2B text communication solutions, has secured its fifth patent in the United States. The patented "system and method" enables the seamless integration of asynchronous communication channels with real-time communication within a single platform.

"Customers want to communicate with companies in various ways. Sometimes, an email or another method that allows the recipient to respond later is best, which is asynchronous communication. However, sometimes rapid, direct, real-time interaction is necessary. Our technology enables seamless integration of these communication types, providing real benefits for our clients: increased user satisfaction, faster issue resolution, and better management of existing information," explains Konrad Kruk, Head of Widget and the patent's author.

The patent granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) describes a system and method that integrates asynchronous messaging with real-time communication, allowing smooth transitions between different communication modes within a single platform. The invention enables users to switch between messages (such as emails or SMS) and real-time interactions (such as voice or video calls) without leaving the communication platform or starting a new session.

"This is our fifth patent, confirming our position as one of the technological innovators in the industry. We are especially proud because the secured solution introduces significant improvements in online communication, ensuring companies maintain uninterrupted and consistent communication with customers across various industries," said Katarzyna Rogowska, head of Text's legal department.

The key benefits of the newly patented solution for Text's clients and end-users include:

- Improved communication efficiency: Combining asynchronous messaging with real-time communication on one platform reduces the need to switch between different communication tools, saving time and increasing productivity.

- Enhanced user experience: Internet users communicating with companies via solutions like LiveChat can enjoy seamless communication, effortlessly transitioning between messaging and real-time conversations. This particularly benefits customer service, remote work, and collaborative projects.

- Increased accessibility: The unified interface makes managing communications easier, ensuring that important messages and real-time interactions are never missed. This is particularly useful in environments where timely communication is critical.

- Easier and more efficient record-keeping: The synchronization feature ensures that all communications are recorded, providing a reliable record of interactions. This can be crucial for legal, compliance, and reference purposes.

- Scalability and flexibility: The system can be scaled to suit different organizational sizes and integrated with other systems, making it a flexible solution for various industries and applications.

In summary, the invention registered by the USPTO enhances communication by combining the advantages of asynchronous messaging and real-time communication in one coherent system, offering increased efficiency, user experience, and accessibility for individuals and organizations.
