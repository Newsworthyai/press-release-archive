# ToolsGroup Reimagines Supply Chain Decisions: Launching Decision Hub and Real-Time Decision-Centric Planning

--News Direct--

ToolsGroup, a global leader in retail and supply chain planning and optimization software, today announced the global launch of Decision Hub, an innovative solution enabling decision-centric planning through zero-latency decision alignment. As a pioneer in solutions that enable supply chain executives to navigate uncertainty, ToolsGroup has long been on the cutting edge, enabling smarter, faster decisions that drive profit. With the release of Decision Hub, ToolsGroup now makes continuous, collaborative and asynchronous decisions in the face of supply chain volatility simple.

Supply chain leaders face unprecedented and increasing supply chain disruptions. They need a faster and more effective way to decide how to respond to emerging threats and situations, unconstrained by the frustrating scheduling conflicts, endless email threads and ad hoc discussions missing critical voices that characterize today’s decision-making process. Decision Hub transforms traditional supply chain decisions by bringing together the right stakeholders at the right time, armed with the right information to make better decisions faster.

With Decision Hub, teams can come together in a virtual situation room to collaborate in real-time to run multiple scenarios, evaluate potential impacts, and decide on the most profitable response. Cross-functional teams can react earlier to changes affecting the balancing of supply and demand, evaluate options to mitigate risks and exploit opportunities, and align on the best actions. By making decisions more efficiently, companies will be able to make plans to respond to changes in the supply chain far enough in advance to maximize the returns on working capital.

"Today, data latency, poor collaboration and rigid decision-making processes all work against companies trying to make the right decisions in the face of uncertainty. Supply chain leaders must collaborate seamlessly and respond in real-time to critical events, adapting production and distribution plans to changes in demand and supply. Decision Hub reimagines this process, innovating decision collaboration for the speed of today’s supply chain," said Robert Kaufholz, Senior VP of Product Management at ToolsGroup.

We are excited to welcome the initial beta users of this transformative technology. If you’re interested in learning more, come visit ToolsGroup today at the Gartner Supply Chain Symposium/Xpo™ 2024 conference in Booth #817 in the Planning Village or read more HERE.
