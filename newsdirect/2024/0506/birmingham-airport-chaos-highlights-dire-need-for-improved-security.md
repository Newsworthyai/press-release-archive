Birmingham Airport faced chaos last week as travelers encountered significant delays and some missed flights due to a 'technical issue' at security during peak departure times.1

Reports of distress emerged, with one individual collapsing amid the turmoil, leading to descriptions of the situation as a "disaster" and an "absolute shambles." The airport acknowledged that the security problem worsened the already busy schedule, severely impacting operations.

Travelers took to social media to express frustration and disappointment. One person described queuing for two hours, only to miss their flight as Ryanair departed on time with a half-empty plane. Roger Burton, a local from Redditch, missed his flight despite arriving three hours early, highlighting the challenges faced by elderly passengers. Another passenger noted the sluggish queues, waiting for 80 others trapped in the winding lines. One traveler criticized the airport's handling as "absolute shocking incompetence."

Criticism persisted as passengers observed the stark contrast between the crowded security area and the empty post-security zone, pointing out the airport's inability to efficiently handle passenger volume. The spokesperson for Birmingham Airport expressed regret over the inconvenience caused by the technical issue, apologizing for the subpar service. Ongoing construction and the transition to a new security area, contributed to passenger challenges.

The chaos at Birmingham Airport closely follows a shocking report from the US Transportation Security Administration. The report reveals at least 300 instances of people bypassing parts of airport security since March 2023,2 prompting the administration to continue its efforts to bolster security, which includes a $3.8 million contract with AI security company Liberty Defense Holdings (TSXV:SCAN) (OTCQB:LDDFF) for its advanced security solutions that can detect concealed weapons in high-traffic areas like airports, stadiums, and schools.

Liberty Defense offers multi-technology security solutions for concealed weapons detection in high-volume foot traffic areas and locations requiring enhanced security, such as airports, stadiums, and schools. The company’s HEXWAVE product, licensed from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), provides discrete, modular, and scalable protection with layered, stand-off detection capability for metallic and non-metallic weapons. Liberty has successfully deployed HEXWAVE across various market verticals, including aviation, courthouses, national labs, prisons, and government facilities.

Liberty Defense Expands HEXWAVE Deployment to a Major Airport in CanadaIn April 2024, Liberty Defense’s HEXWAVE™ product received formal equipment authorization approval from Innovation, Science, and Economic Development Canada (ISED). This milestone signifies a significant achievement for Liberty's ultra-wideband technology. With this certification, the company can deploy HEXWAVE for commercial and government applications across Canada.

On May 6, Liberty Defense Holdings Ltd. (TSXV:SCAN)(OTCQB:LDDFF) announced the shipment of multiple commercial HEXWAVE units to a major airport in Canada.

HEXWAVE surpasses legacy security systems by detecting a wide array of materials, including metal and non-metal threats, liquids, powders, plastic explosives, and 3D-printed ghost guns.

Bill Frain, CEO of Liberty Defense, explained the technology behind HEXWAVE, which uses millimeter wave, advanced 3D imaging, and AI for comprehensive screening. Frain highlighted HEXWAVE's efficiency in processing high volumes of passengers without requiring them to remove everyday items like wallets. The system's mobility enables the airport to swiftly deploy and relocate HEXWAVE units as needed, both indoors and outdoors.

Liberty Defense is also expanding its international base, recently shipping commercial units of its HEXWAVE™ system to Amsterdam in the Netherlands and Subic Bay Airport in the Philippines.
