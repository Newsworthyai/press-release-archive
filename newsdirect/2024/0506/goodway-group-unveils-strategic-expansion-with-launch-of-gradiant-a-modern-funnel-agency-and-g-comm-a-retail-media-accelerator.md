# Goodway Group Unveils Strategic Expansion With Launch of GRADIANT, a modern funnel agency and G-Comm, a retail media accelerator

--News Direct--

Goodway Group, a leading independent digital marketing agency, announces its strategic expansion efforts by launching two divisions to help marketers capitalize on the industry’s future: GRADIANT, a modern funnel marketing agency, and G-Comm, a specialized retail media accelerator. This expansion delivers brands the future of deep analytics, identity, and measurement, today.

Goodway Group boasts a strong legacy of innovation and technical prowess, with accolades such as being a three-time MarTech Breakthrough award winner and AdExchanger’s Best Use of Technology by an Agency award winner. Since its inception in 1929, Goodway Group has continually excelled at being at the leading edge of marketing and a go-to resource for brands to evolve their marketing practice.

GRADIANT, the newly launched modern funnel marketing agency, sets a new standard in the next generation of media investment by bringing its massive identity graph and proprietary measurement to holistically measure brand and performance. Leveraging a blend of data science, strategy and ongoing machine learning, GRADIANT delivers “CFO-friendly” outcomes. Marc Ducnuigeen, Chief Client Officer at Goodway Group, remarked, "GRADIANT bridges the gap between brand and demand, giving marketers the answers they need to secure boardroom and CMO approval."

Similarly, G-Comm, the specialized retail media accelerator, creates a mutually beneficial relationship by addressing the unique challenges and opportunities within the retail landscape. G-Comm empowers retailers to build or upgrade their retail media networks (RMNs) while providing brands with the means to maximize engagement on existing platforms. Angela Myers, SVP of G-Comm, emphasized, "Both brands and retailers know the retail media potential is immense but have not yet found excellence across the practice as a whole. Through our experience with helping retailers build and upgrade their own RMNs and executing growth strategies for RMN brands, G-Comm brings this unique perspective, that you simply won’t find elsewhere."

Goodway Group is widely recognized by retailers, brands, and technology partners within the industry, illustrated by being a finalist in the esteemed Modern Retail Award for Best Retailer/Agency Collaboration.

Jay Friedman, CEO of Goodway Group, expressed excitement about continuing to lead the industry: "Boards of Directors, CFOs, and CEOs rightfully want to know more precisely the return on their marketing investment. We are delighted to work with CMOs to show them how measurement, analytics execution, and provable outcomes can be better. GRADIANT and G-Comm allow us to further specialize within two key areas of industry growth. We’ve spent the last couple years innovating to deliver ahead of what marketers need. Seeing the culmination of these efforts is credit to our team.”
