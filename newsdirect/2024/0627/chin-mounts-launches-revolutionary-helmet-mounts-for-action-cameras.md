The new mounts feature a low-profile design that minimizes interference and ensures maximum stability. They are compatible with a wide range of helmets and action cameras, including GoPro and Insta360 models. Made from high-quality materials, these mounts are built to last and perform well in various weather conditions.

A key feature of these mounts is their custom fit, designed to accommodate over 800 different helmet models from brands like AGV, Arai, Bell, Fox, HJC, and Shoei. This extensive compatibility ensures that users can find the perfect fit for their specific helmet, providing optimal camera positioning and reducing neck strain during long rides.

Installation is simple, using high-strength 3M adhesive tape and stainless steel fasteners. There's no need for specialized tools, making the process accessible for all riders. Additionally, the mounts can be easily removed, allowing users to switch between different helmets or adjust the mount's position as needed.

By offering a stable and secure way to mount action cameras, Chin Mounts enables riders to capture high-quality footage of their journeys, enhancing the overall riding experience. The lightweight design adds minimal extra weight to the helmet and reduces wind resistance, contributing to a comfortable and enjoyable ride.
