# Machupicchu is the only wonder of the world to have Carbon Neutral certification

Today, June 27, in the context of the 17th anniversary of its election as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World, the Historic Sanctuary of Machupicchu, in the Cusco region, has again received the certificate as a "Carbon Neutral Destination". This achievement places Peru at the forefront of environmental sustainability and the efforts to combat the effects of climate change.

Our world wonder has received this distinction as a result of the commitment of the public and private sectors, who joined forces to achieve this valuable result. On the one hand, the driving group formed by the Municipality of Machupicchu, AJE Group, Inkaterra and Tetra Pak, and the allied group formed by PROMPERÚ, World Xchange, Luz del Sur, Bosques Amazónicos (BAM), Latam and CANATUR.

The certification was awarded by Green Initiative, the leading company in climate certification in the tourism sector, which recognizes the fulfillment of its decarbonization goals.

To achieve this recognition, the Machupicchu Historic Sanctuary has adopted effective measures to reduce its carbon footprint and offset remaining emissions, implementing sustainable practices such as solid waste management and promoting a circular economy.

"At PROMPERÚ, we have the firm purpose of contributing to the sustainable and decentralized development of our country," stated PROMPERÚ's Executive President, Claricia Tirado, at the ceremony held at Manco Cápac Square in Aguas Calientes.

"All of us who play a role in the public or private sector have the responsibility to ensure that the economic benefits generated are accompanied by sustainable management," she added.

It is important to highlight that the certification took the 2019 carbon emissions results as a baseline and focused on stimulating actions for the reduction, treatment and correct management of the waste generated. It also included raising awareness among residents, businesses and hotels.

Along these lines, four processes were implemented to reuse usable waste: the installation of a PET plastic and cardboard compacting plant; a biodiesel plant to process waste oil from restaurants and casinos; an organic waste pyrolyzing plant to generate natural charcoal; and two glass crushing machines to convert bottles into grit for construction and ornamental purposes.

This circular economy model allows us to give a new life to usable waste such as plastic, cardboard, Tetra Pak containers and glass, in addition to oil treatment.

PROMPERÚ continues to promote and work on responsible and sustainable tourism. We know that it is more than trying to stand out, it is a necessity.

Peru Export and Tourism Promotion Board (PROMPERÚ). We are the government agency in charge of the development and implementation of global strategies to position Peru via the promotion of its image, touristic destinations, added value exports and inversions.
