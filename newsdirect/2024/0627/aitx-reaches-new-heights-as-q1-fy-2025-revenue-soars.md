# AITX Reaches New Heights as Q1 FY 2025 Revenue Soars

The global security robots market, valued at USD 27.32 billion in 2021, is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.65% during the forecast period. This robust growth is driven by a variety of factors, including escalating security concerns, the increasing adoption of advanced automation techniques worldwide, and more. Among the companies benefiting from this trend is Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions (OTC:AITX). AITX is a prominent player in the field of AI-driven security and productivity solutions and has recently announced a significant milestone, marking its first-ever quarter with over $1 million in total revenue.

Market Context and Demand Drivers

Several key factors contribute to the rising demand for security robots. Increasing geopolitical instabilities and the potential for substantial government investment in security advancements are creating favorable conditions for market growth. Security robots' advanced capabilities, such as operating in challenging terrains and hazardous environments, performing analytical-based surveillance, and other complex tasks, are driving their adoption across various countries. Improvements in sensor technology and high automation capabilities, coupled with advancements in neural technology that enhance functionality over time, are also positively impacting market growth.

Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions

AITX is at the forefront of delivering AI-based solutions that empower organizations to gain new insights, address complex challenges, and foster new business ideas. Through its next-generation robotic product offerings—RAD-I, RAD-R, RAD-M, and RAD-G—the company helps organizations streamline operations, increase ROI, and enhance business efficiency. AITX's technology simplifies and reduces the cost of patrolling and guard services, allowing experienced personnel to focus on more critical tasks. The solutions are widely applicable across multiple industries, including enterprises, government, transportation, critical infrastructure, education, and healthcare.

Recent Milestone: Q1 FY 2025 Revenue Surge

On June 17, 2024, AITX announced a remarkable increase in its recurring monthly revenue (RMR) for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, marking a 385% year-over-year growth. The company's unaudited operating revenue for Q1 FY 2025 stood at $1,098,975, up from $384,277 in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year. This significant milestone underscores the company's ongoing exponential growth.

Steve Reinharz, CEO/CTO of AITX, expressed his satisfaction, stating, "Achieving continuous, exponential growth is what we forecasted and what we have delivered once again. Although we have smartly added some general expenses in sales, support, and development, we remain committed to operational profitability this fiscal year. It’s important that we position ourselves to be a dominant player in the solar security tower market, support the launch of AIR in our Gen4 solutions, and prepare for the upcoming relaunch of ROAMEROAMEO pleased to say we are on track."

Strategic Moves and Future Potential

The company highlighted that over $125,000 in RMR, representing $375,000 in quarterly recurring revenue, has yet to be deployed. Mark Folmer, President of Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc. (RAD), a wholly-owned subsidiary of AITX, mentioned, "The transition to our Gen4 solutions could be another driving force for RAD this year. But even without Gen4 fully launched, we continue to receive re-orders from both large and smaller clients."

Troy McCanna, RAD’s Chief Security Officer & Senior Vice President of Revenue Operations, shared his enthusiasm: "We are absolutely thrilled that during one month of the first quarter, we saw a staggering 385% year-over-year increase in RMR. Our clients’ enthusiastic adoption of RAD’s technology is a clear indicator that we are on the right track. Going forward, several clients have verbally confirmed orders, and we are awaiting those contracts before making the related announcements."

AITX's recent achievements and the broader market dynamics highlight the potential for substantial growth in the security robots market. The company's focus on AI-driven solutions and recurring revenue models positions it well to capitalize on the increasing demand for advanced security technologies. As the company continues to innovate and expand its market presence, the future looks promising, making AITX a stock to watch.
