Ethical engineering may only receive lip service from some companies, but it's a guiding principle for Laser Photonics Corp (NASDAQ: LASE) (LPC). Sustainability and environmental and societal impacts must be part of the equation in research and development, engineering and manufacturing, the company believes. A business with ethical standards enhances safety, improves quality, builds public trust and promotes sustainability – these values define the company.

It's a belief Laser Photonics has long subscribed to. The company, established in 1981, adheres to a stringent ethical code of conduct when developing industrial-strength laser systems for cleaning, cutting, marking and welding. That code includes a commitment to transparency, while meeting all applicable laws, regulations and industry standards – as well as taking responsibility for actions, decisions and results. Laser Photonics says it strives for excellence in all aspects of its business and is committed to sustainable and environmentally responsible practices.

Laser Photonics Leads By Example Ethical leadership is a big part of achieving engineering excellence. After all, ethical leaders are the ones who embody positive behavior and foster cultures in which integrity, respect and sustainability are among the top tenets. That ethical prowess appears to be in abundance at Laser Photonics, thanks to a deep management bench and a world-class research and development (R&D) team led by CEO Wayne Tupuola, who has over 15 years of C-level management experience. Before joining Laser Photonics, Tupuola spent over 25 years in the fiber laser equipment, semiconductor and aerospace industries – honing his craft and cultivating a commitment to the principles of ethical engineering.

A similar pedigree is also found in Laser Photonics’ R&D team, which holds several patents and is focused on creating reliable and cutting-edge solutions. The team’s commitment to continuous innovation nurtures customer loyalty and drives growth. It's why Laser Photonics counts more than 100 Fortune 1000 companies in the aerospace, defense, energy, automotive and maritime industries as customers, including General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) and Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT).

Ethics In ManufacturingThe company’s focus on ethical business is also reflected in its approach to developing, manufacturing and commercializing laser systems. LPC says it prioritizes quality in every component and sub-assembly it designs to produce machines that are built to last, are easily mastered and require minimal upkeep. Laser systems such as its CleanTech products are also easily integrated into production lines and capable of handling specialized tasks.

To protect its customers, Laser Photonics has built in an added level of security, including a manual reset, a key-locked laser power switch and a remote interlock connector, which all serve to prevent accidental exposure to laser radiation. Optional features include an exhaust outlet for fume extraction and a Class I operator safe viewing port for safe observation of the laser cleaning process and easier alignment. LPC says these features set it apart in the industry and showcase its commitment to providing safe and effective technology to its customers.

Since Laser Photonics develops laser systems certified by the Food and Drug Administration’s(FDA) and Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), the company is positioned to meet rigorous standards for the safety of customers and employees. As a result, LPC says investors can be confident in its dedication to aligning with ESG principles and reaching sustainability goals.

Societal Impact Beyond its approach to business, LPC is making a positive impact on society, underscoring its commitment to upholding strong ethics. For centuries, sand and abrasive blasting was the go-to way to remove contaminants from substrates, but this practice creates hazardous work environments and exposes workers to crystalline silica, which is one of the most common minerals found in stone, rock, brick, mortar and block. Exposure to airborne silica dust occurs when cutting, sawing, drilling and crushing stones and using sand products such as abrasive blasting tools. Inhaling silica dust was found to cause irreversible lung damage and even lung cancer.

Laser Photonics is turning the old way of surface processing on its head with its CleanTech brand of lasers used to remove rust, mold and other residue. These state-of–the-art systems accurately and quickly remove contaminants from a wide range of surfaces without damaging the underlying substrate and while keeping the operator safe from harmful chemicals and substances.

Ethical engineering is the foundation for growth, and that’s not lost on Laser Photonics. From its management team to its laser development processes, LPC has best practices, sustainability, safety and reliability at the forefront of its operations. The set of values the company brings to the table is the key component to its continuous expansion. Companies big and small, as well as government agencies, rely on Laser Photonics because of its quality, reputation and ethical approach to engineering.
