# Sapphire Technologies and TB Global Technologies Ltd. Achieve First-of-Its-Kind Industry Milestone to Accelerate Energy Innovation in Japan

Sapphire Technologies, a leading developer and manufacturer of energy recovery systems for hydrogen and natural gas applications, proudly announces a first of its kind operational milestone of 13,000 operating hours for its FreeSpin In-line Turboexpanders in the Japanese market. This achievement represents a groundbreaking advancement in the turboexpander industry, furthering joint efforts to decarbonize the natural gas sector and bolster sustainability with the following benchmarks:

* Produced over 2.5 gigawatt-hours of electricity, valued at approximately 550,000 USD (86 million Yen) *1)。 when calculated with the electricity costs for homes in Japan
* Prevented the emission of 1,934 tons of CO2e*2), emphasizing the substantial environmental and economic impact of Sapphire’s FreeSpin In-line Turboexpander;
* Solidifies Sapphire's presence in the Japanese market and sets the foundation for expanding
* market opportunities and collaboration within the region's energy sector.

*1) based on the information reported by Ms. Catharina Klein (researcher of Statista) on May 8, 2024.

*2) calculated using EPA calculator of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The 13,000-hour milestone not only underscores the operational excellence of Sapphire's turboexpanders, but also demonstrates its proven reliability and durability in real-world conditions. After a year of successful operation, a thorough boroscope inspection was conducted on all critical components, including the impeller. The inspection confirmed that there were no signs of wear or degradation, highlighting the potential for many more years of reliable, continuous operation.

“Sapphire Technologies is thrilled to mark this significant milestone in our expansion within the Japanese market,” said Freddie Sarhan, CEO of Sapphire Technologies. “This accomplishment highlights our dedication to setting a new standard for energy recovery systems, and also paves the way for additional growth opportunities and collaborations within the Japanese energy sector."
