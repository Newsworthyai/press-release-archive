São Paulo, November 18, 2024 - Mercado Bitcoin (MB), the largest digital asset platform in Latin America, announces the launch of MBRL stablecoin on the TRON blockchain. The MBRL stablecoin presents an innovative means of payment that combines the trust and stability of Brazilian fiat currency with the utility and ease of tokenization.

The MBRL stablecoin is an MB project that uses the TRON network through integration with the blockchain. This integration aims to create a fast, accessible and scalable smart contract platform. MBRL is designed to act as a reliable store of value with liquidity for withdrawals around the clock, including weekends and public holidays. Additionally, MBRL can be easily integrated into blockchain wallets, DeFi platforms, and dApps, making it incredibly versatile and easy to use.

Lucca Benedetti, Product Analyst at MB, commented, "The introduction of MBRL is a significant milestone for both MB and the growing crypto community in Brazil. The TRON blockchain has already seen widespread adoption in the region. We are further solidifying our presence within the TRON ecosystem through the launch of MBRL. I'm looking forward to seeing the positive effects MBRL will bring”.

Sam Elfarra, Community Spokesperson at TRON DAO commented, "We are thrilled to see MRBL launch in the TRON ecosystem. The launch is a significant step forward in our mission to provide accessible, efficient, and scalable blockchain solutions globally, showcasing the versatility and robustness of the TRON network. I believe MRBL will play a key role in accelerating the adoption of blockchain technology across the region".

TRON network, the trusted network for developers, institutions, and individuals worldwide, is a layer-1 open-source blockchain protocol with over 271 million user accounts. With a total transfer volume exceeding $14 trillion, TRON stands out for its ability to efficiently handle both large and small transactions. Its speed and cost-effectiveness make it especially popular among retail users for fast, frequent, low-value transactions like remittances, micropayments, and peer-to-peer transfers. Leveraging the TRON network will enable MB to offer users faster, more reliable asset transfers with lower fees, enhancing the overall efficiency and accessibility of transactions.

Customers in supported jurisdictions can now buy MBRL on Mercado Bitcoin's offer book or issue it directly with a deposit of BRL. They then receive MBRL stablecoins, which can be easily transacted in just a few seconds. Management and custody of the assets are carried out by MB Pay, Mercado Bitcoin's payment institution.

About TRON DAO

TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.

Founded in September 2017 by Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services, boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of November 2024, it has over 271 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 8.9 billion total transactions, and over $18 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN.

In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO . Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government’s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (“DMC”), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica’s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens – TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.
