Direxion, a leading provider of leveraged, inverse, and non-traditional ETFs, today announced it has appointed Douglas Yones to the position of Chief Executive Officer. In this new role, Yones will lead and drive the strategic vision and growth plan of the firm.

Mr. Yones most recently served as Head of Exchange Traded Products at the New York Stock Exchange, overseeing listings and operations for ETPs, Closed-End Funds, and SPACs. His team supported issuers in product development, regulatory compliance, and listing processes to drive growth, distribution, and market quality.

“Doug’s history of delivering innovative ideas and valuable insights in the capital markets was a major reason for bringing him aboard, and Direxion is delighted to welcome him to the team,” said Michael Rafferty, CEO of Rafferty Holdings, Direxion’s parent company. “Douglas will help us build on the momentum we’ve created over the past two decades as we continue to provide the high-quality fund solutions our customers have come to expect from us.”

Yones is well known and respected in the global ETF industry: Doug spent 17 years at The Vanguard Group, leading Domestic Equity Indexing/ETF Product Management and contributing to ETF development across the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Asia. He holds a ChFC and CETF, an M.B.A. from Villanova, a bachelor’s from Penn State, and is a registered Options and General Securities Principal with FINRA.

“Direxion has always set the bar high for progressive ETF ideas—especially in the non-traditional, leveraged, and inverse space,” said Yones. “I couldn’t be more excited to join forces with such a talented team of people. Their dedication and creativity have been instrumental in driving success, and together, we’re ready to bring fresh ideas to life, ensuring that traders and investors continue to receive the unique opportunities they’ve come to expect from us."

Yones will be based out of Direxion’s New York City office.

Leveraged and Inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by sophisticated investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.
