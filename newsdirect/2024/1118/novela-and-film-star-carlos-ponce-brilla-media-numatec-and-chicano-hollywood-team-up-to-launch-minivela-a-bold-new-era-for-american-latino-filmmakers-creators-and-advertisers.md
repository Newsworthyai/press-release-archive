Novela and film star Carlos Ponce, Brilla Media, Numatec, and Chicano Hollywood are partnering to launch Minivela, a digital shorts joint venture that starting in January marks a bold new era for American Latino filmmakers, creators, and advertisers. The announcement was made today in Las Vegas as part of the 26th annual ANA Multicultural Marketing & Diversity Conference that is taking place at the Bellagio. (See the Minivela trailer here).

True to its name, Minivela combines the fast-paced nature of vertical short-form content with the iconic, entertaining essence of the telenovela—a genre created by Latinos. The advertiser-supported Minivelas, – ranging from 10 to 90 minutes – are being developed collaboratively with filmmakers and influencers in English, Spanish, or bilingually, depending on the organic needs of the stories.

“This is a groundbreaking journey that we believe will empower Latino storytellers and drive U.S. Hispanic digital advertising for years to come,” said Manny Ruiz, who will serve as the Chief Creative Officer and Executive Producer of the joint venture alongside Ponce and will also write and direct select Minivelas. “Our focus is on consistently producing universally appealing stories with a vision that extends beyond Minivelas. A key pillar of our innovative approach is to catapult select narratives into independent features or series.”

“Minivela represents a beacon of hope, experimentation, and opportunities for Latino creatives at a time when the Hollywood system is undergoing a much-needed reboot,” said Ponce, who in addition to executive producing, will also act and/or direct in select Minivelas. “I’m thrilled that our Latino-owned venture will address the representation gap for our community organically, and that our operations are driven by pioneers in Latino social media, digital media, and adtech.”

Minivela primarily targets American Latinos 18-34, and will commence weekly in January with content verticals that feature romantic comedies, strange happenings, the supernatural, and even La Mala Suegra (The evil mother-in-law). The family-friendly digital films will be accessible free on Minivela’s YouTube, and social media channels, as well as thru adtech conglomerate, Numatec’s distribution partnerships. Combined with Brilla Media’s Nuestro Media network, brand sponsors will be able to secure USH audiences effectively across digital, CTV, and other platforms.

Let the Films Roll!

A cornerstone of Minivela is Chicano Hollywood, the influential L.A.-based production, media, and magazine company that produces the annual Elevate conference for Latino filmmakers, and is the exclusive West Coast production arm of the company.

Chicano Hollywood is already producing one of the platform’s early bets, a feel good romcom called “Cholita Takes L.A.” that is being directed by a rising Chicana director. Cholitas, Cholos, and Cholas shine in this story about a young Bolivian luchadora and aspiring fashion designer who journeys to L.A. to care for her ailing grandmother—only to discover she must also overcome culture clashes and personal challenges on her path to unexpected love.

“Minivela is putting deeds before words, and that’s something the Latino film community will root hard for, and why we’re a proud partner,” said Johnny Murrillo, founder and CEO of Chicano Hollywood. “It’s also critical to note that for Minivela, the projects must be Latino-produced but the stories must appeal to audiences universally even outside our core Hispanic community. We have some fun ones lined up!”

A Force For Good

Being a force for good also matters deeply to Minivela’s founders.

“We’re going to push boundaries and prove that you can be creative and positively provocative without leaning on the usual violent drug dealers, and other tired tropes that diminish our community,” said Angela Sustaita-Ruiz, chairwoman of Brilla Media, the parent company of Minivela. “I believe Minivela will also prove to be a catalyst for many Latinas and Latinos who one day will remember that they got their big Hollywood break writing/directing, producing and/or acting in a Minivela.”
