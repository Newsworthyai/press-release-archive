While all eyes may be on the election of former President Donald Trump to a second non-consecutive term, that’s just one of the critical catalysts that stand poised to potentially forever change the investment landscape. That’s why there’s not a moment to miss, and concerned market participants may want to attend the upcoming Crossroads Summit 2024 to prepare for the future.

Held in beautiful Miami, FL, Crossroads will bring together some of the brightest minds across finance, applied science and geopolitics. Between Nov. 21 and Nov. 22, renowned experts will share their blueprint for a global ecosystem undergoing radical transitions. Thanks to the rapid social integration of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, the economy will likely separate investors into two categories: the prepared and everyone else.

With only days left for the conference, prospective attendees should make their decision quickly. Following a breakfast and welcoming session by host Karl Sprague and keynote speaker John Bartleman of TradeStation – the title sponsor of the summit — the expert panel will jump right into the thick of things. Given the dynamic environment that’s likely to evolve rapidly, interested investors have little time to waste.

Positioning America In A Shifting World OrderRight off the bat, Crossroads Summit 2024 kicks off on day one with Peter Zeihan, one of the foremost figures in the field of geopolitical analysis. In his keynote address, “Navigating the End of the World: Geopolitics and the Future of America,” Zeihan offers timely and critical insight into how significant evolutions in global power structures are changing the landscape for U.S. investors.

Most notably, Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine represents one of the most dangerous flashpoints in world affairs. In addition, Americans must take note of brewing tensions in China and how these and other factors could impact markets both domestically and abroad. With his inimitable wit and dry humor, Zeihan will provide investors with nuanced context to help investors properly map their decisions.

Bracing For Potentially Radical Change In Domestic PolicyOn the eve of the 2024 presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris appeared to command the polling advantage. However, when the actual ballots were submitted, President-elect Trump successfully completed a surprising comeback. Subsequently, the opposing Democrats launched into a blame game, but a loss may have been inevitable. Globally, other incumbent political parties suffered defeats amid a populist backlash, as well.

This backdrop presents rich grounds for the next panel of industry experts, including Michael Khouw from CNBC, Mike McGlone from Bloomberg, and Katheryn Rooney Vera from StoneX. Saif Ishoof will moderate the discussion, titled “Strategic Adaptation: Preparing for Turbulence in the U.S. Landscape,” which will shine a light on the uncertainties of domestic policy shifts under a second Trump term and how investors may navigate them.

Preparing For A Possible Inflection PointWith the stratospheric rise of both equities and cryptocurrencies in the post-pandemic cycle, it’s easy to get lulled into a sense of complacency. However, author Neil Howe – an expert on generational cycles – will argue in his discussion “The Fourth Turning: Navigating Crisis and Renewal” that investors need to be more vigilant about contemporary events. Essentially, the good times might not continue unabated.

According to Howe’s theory, major historical events are tied to recurring cycles, with each ebb and flow potentially lasting decades. Therefore, while the present bullish framework in global capital markets may entice an acquisitive posture, it’s vital to consider past crises and periods of renewal to properly understand the current juncture. Potential blind spots may include the rise of China and the Biden administration’s subsequent crackdown on the nation’s tech industry.

Following a lunch break, moderator Bryan Gorrita will guide a panel of distinguished figures: Mike Green from Simplify Asset Management, Susan Lindeque, founder and CEO of Avestix Group and Luke Gromen of Forest for the Trees. Together, the experts will discuss methods of profiting from the potential turbulence and volatility catapulted by the upcoming “Fourth Turning.”

Battening Down The HatchesIn one of the most anticipated keynote addresses, economist and author Alan Beaulieu will discuss the potential for a radical paradigm shift that may erupt in the 2030s decade. As co-author of Prosperity in the Age of Decline, Beaulieu adopts a futurist mentality, offering practical and insightful guidance on boosting profits irrespective of business cycle changes.

However, because of the nature of contemporary global markets, the expert anticipates a sobering scenario over the next few years. His discussion, “Forecasting the Future: Economic Collapse in the 2030s,” offers a much-needed blueprint on the conditions that could lead to ruin – and most importantly, what investors can do right now to protect their wealth.

If there were just one reason to attend the Crossroads Summit 2024, this talking point may very well be it.

The Age Of The MachinesFinally, conference attendees will gain greater appreciation and knowledge of perhaps the most transformative digital innovation since the rise of the internet: AI and its capacity to positively disrupt multiple sectors, including finance, healthcare and manufacturing. Driving this discussion will be Michael Jabbour, Chief Innovation Officer at Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT).

Among the foremost leaders in integrating the broader digital transformation, Jabbour specializes in the acceleration and personalization of learning. In addition, his role at Microsoft enables him to empower both educators and students with knowledge about the transformative and ethical application of AI. Through his address, investors can learn firsthand how AI can improve efficiency and, therefore, the bottom line.

With multiple enterprises aligned with the generative AI ecosystem racing toward a $4 trillion valuation, this is a discussion investors can’t afford to miss.

The Must-Watch Event Of The Year Is Coming SoonWith global instability, economic uncertainty and technological disruption defining the landscape of the new economy, Crossroads Summit 2024 kicks off with a key opportunity for investors to learn strategies to navigate uncertainty. From understanding the future of geopolitics to preparing for the next potential economic collapse, the insights shared at this event are more relevant than ever. Investors who attend will be equipped with the knowledge and strategies needed to navigate the complexities of the evolving paradigm.

Don’t miss out on this chance to hear from industry leaders and innovators who are shaping the future. Right from the first day, Crossroads is set to offer the guidance and foresight that investors need to thrive in the years to come.
