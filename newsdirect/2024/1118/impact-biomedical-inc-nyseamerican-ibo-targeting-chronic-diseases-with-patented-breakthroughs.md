# Impact BioMedical Inc. (NYSEAmerican: IBO): Targeting Chronic Diseases with Patented Breakthroughs

The biotechnology industry is booming, with a global market valued at $1.55 trillion in 2023 and projected to grow at a 13.96% annual rate through 2030. Driving this growth are government-backed initiatives to modernize regulations, streamline approvals, and improve access to personalized medicine and orphan drugs—paving the way for emerging companies.

Chronic inflammatory diseases, identified by the World Health Organization as the leading global health threat, are a key focus area. Recent estimates reveal nearly 60% of Americans live with at least one chronic condition, and three out of five deaths worldwide result from diseases like cancer, diabetes, and respiratory disorders. This urgent need for solutions presents immense opportunities for innovation.

In this rapidly evolving landscape, Impact BioMedical Inc. (NYSEAmerican: IBO) emerges as a promising player committed to advancing healthcare innovation.

A Promising Player in Biotech

Impact BioMedical Inc. (NYSEAmerican: IBO), a pioneering biotechnology firm, has quickly captured attention since its IPO in September 2024. Focused on discovering, developing, and patenting innovative solutions for human healthcare and wellness, the company is building momentum as it positions itself to address unmet medical needs in various fields.

A Strong Start: The IPO and Investor Confidence

On September 16, 2024, Impact BioMedical entered the public market with its initial public offering of 1.5 million shares priced at $3.00 each. The IPO, which raised $4.5 million, garnered robust interest, with over 30% of shares purchased by existing investors. This strong participation signals significant confidence in the company’s potential and direction.

Impact BioMedical CEO Frank D. Heuszel commented on the IPO’s success, emphasizing that investor confidence reflects the belief in the company’s mission to deliver transformative healthcare solutions.

Leadership Positioned for Growth

At the helm of Impact BioMedical is a highly experienced leadership team. CEO Frank D. Heuszel, with a background in finance and executive leadership, has been instrumental in guiding the company’s strategic direction. Heuszel’s tenure as CEO of DSS, Inc., Impact BioMedical’s parent company, since 2019 has prepared him to navigate the complexities of biotech innovation and commercialization.

Supporting Heuszel is COO Mark Suseck, who brings extensive experience in strategy, licensing, and acquisitions from his time at DSS BioHealth Holdings and Vivacitas Oncology. CFO Todd Macko complements the team with his expertise in financial planning, analysis, and mergers and acquisitions, ensuring the company is fiscally sound as it expands.

Together, this leadership team aims to drive innovation and establish Impact BioMedical as a key player in the biotechnology sector.

Innovative Technology Platforms with Real-World Applications

Impact BioMedical is built on a foundation of cutting-edge technologies designed to tackle pressing healthcare challenges. Two standout platforms, 3F and Linebacker, highlight the company’s unique approach to improving human health and wellness.

The 3F insect repellent technology recently secured a U.S. patent, showcasing its potential as a natural solution to reduce insect landings and bites. Unlike chemical-based alternatives, 3F uses plant-derived formulations to effectively “blind” insects to human presence. Its applications range from standalone repellents to integrations in shampoos and detergents. With vector-borne diseases accounting for 17% of infectious diseases globally, 3F addresses a significant market need. CEO Frank Heuszel emphasized the company’s commitment to advancing commercialization efforts with potential partners, aiming to provide eco-friendly solutions for outdoor safety.

Another major achievement is the Canadian patent for Linebacker technology, which targets inflammatory diseases with novel phenolic compounds. This platform offers potential relief for conditions such as arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease, while mitigating the side effects associated with traditional treatments. Derived from myricetin, a plant-based flavonoid, Linebacker compounds are designed to inhibit inflammatory responses and oncogenic pathways. The technology has been licensed to ProPhase Laboratories for global development and commercialization, paving the way for promising revenue opportunities.

Expanding IP Portfolio

Impact BioMedical’s ability to secure patents across jurisdictions underscores its commitment to innovation and its potential for market leadership. The company’s IP portfolio includes patents for insect repellent compositions and inflammatory disease treatments in the U.S., Canada, and other regions, providing a strong competitive edge.

The Road Ahead

As a relatively new public entity, Impact BioMedical has already demonstrated an ability to attract investor confidence, build a robust IP portfolio, and establish partnerships for product development. The company’s technologies address critical health challenges, offering significant market potential in both developed and emerging markets.

Conclusion

Impact BioMedical (NYSEAmerican: IBO) is emerging as a promising force in biotechnology. With its focus on innovative healthcare solutions, a strong leadership team, and a growing IP portfolio, the company could be well-positioned for long-term growth. Impact BioMedical’s strategic initiatives and commitment to innovation offer a compelling case for investors looking to tap into the potential of healthcare advancements.
