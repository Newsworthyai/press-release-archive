Turning back the clock on aging is a never-ending quest with people, large companies and startups pouring blood, sweat, tears – and tons of money – into finding a solution. One company that seems to be getting closer to its goal is Telomir Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: TELO), a pre-clinical pharma company seeking to lead developments in longevity science through treating age-related conditions. Its leading drug compound, Telomir-1, was featured in an ABC television news segment highlighting promising "age reversal" outcomes in a study with two senior dogs.

Lengthening DNA’s Protective Caps Telomir-1, the company's leading drug compound, is designed to regenerate telomeres – the protective DNA structures at the ends of our chromosomes, often compared to the caps on shoelaces. Research has demonstrated that repairing these telomeres may extend biological age and reverse certain age-related conditions. By targeting telomere regeneration, Telomir-1 aims to slow down the aging process and combat diseases linked to telomere shortening.

Telomir Pharmaceuticals says Telomir-1 is the first novel small molecule to lengthen the DNA’s protective telomere caps to potentially reverse age-related conditions. The novel molecule, which Telomir is testing with mice and dogs with an eye toward human clinical trials, binds to critical metals that wear down telomeres. By limiting the availability of metals and interrupting the enzyme function, Telomir-1 seeks to restore cellular metal homeostasis and reverse a person's or animal’s biological age. The oral therapy potentially provides what the company says is a safe and effective alternative to existing treatments with minimal side effects.

Telomir-1 Gets Props In News Segment In the segment, "ABC7 Exclusive: New study reveals promising results for age reversal pill on dogs," the potential of Telomir-1 was on display through the stories of Zeus and Benson, two senior dogs from Donte's Den rescue organization in Myakka City, Florida. After being treated with Telomir-1, both dogs exhibited improvements in their health conditions, according to Telomir. Zeus, a 12-year-old German Shepherd, showed complete remission of terminal cancer, while Benson, a 12-year-old Newfoundland suffering from severe arthritis, regained his mobility, leading to what caretakers described as a miraculous recovery, reports Telomir.

"The results of this study highlight the groundbreaking potential of Telomir-1. Our priority is to advance the rigorous scientific research required to bring this promising treatment to humans and pets through the regulatory process as swiftly and safely as possible," said Erez Aminov, CEO of Telomir. "At Telomir, we are dedicated to transforming the future of longevity science, and these early findings bring us one step closer to making that vision a reality."

Aminov was named CEO earlier this month after the passing of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Christopher Chapman, Jr., M.D. Aminov was most recently CEO of MIRA Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: MIRA). The positive preclinical trials have shown that Telomir-1 may have several applications in the veterinary market, which is large given that Americans are poised to spend $156 billion on their pets by the end of this year.

The use of Telomir-1 in the two dogs was observed by Telomir's special advisor Dr. Michael Roizen, the former Chief Wellness Officer of the Cleveland Clinic and a leader in age-related medicine. In this small compassionate use program, remarkable improvements in the health and vitality of the dogs after treatment with Telomir-1 were noted, offering a glimpse into the potential future applications for humans, reported Telomir. "The preliminary results we're seeing with Telomir-1 are very encouraging. By lengthening telomeres, we believe Telomir-1 can promote cell regeneration and potentially reverse several aspects of aging or age-related conditions. I'm excited to continue working with Telomir to explore the full potential of this innovative therapy,” Roizen said.

More Tests Underway Nobody wants to get old and that includes pets. With Americans pouring tons of money into keeping their pooches happy and healthy, they may someday have another tool: Telmoir-1. With encouraging results out of its study with two dogs and more positive results expected down the road, this may be a company worth paying attention to as the quest to reverse time continues.
