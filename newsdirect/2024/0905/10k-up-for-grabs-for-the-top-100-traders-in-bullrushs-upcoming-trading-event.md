Gamified trading platform BullRush is offering a unique opportunity for anyone interested in learning how to trade while making money. Starting from its September 9 launch, the company is running a fantasy trading game with a total prize pool of $10,000 to be awarded to the top 100 traders in the competition.

The trading competition will feature any of the following assets: Crypto, Forex and CFDs. Whether you are an experienced or beginner trader, BullRush’s launch event could be your chance to level up your skills and potentially walk away with a cash prize.

Master The Art Of Trading With BullRushBullRush's trading platform offers skill-based games, which, much like chess, require participants to master various tools and strategies to outwit their opponents and win. The upcoming tournament allows traders to practice new skills, strategies and ideas in a demo account without using real money. This focus on strategy and skill makes BullRush a suitable learning ground for traders of all experience levels.

Fantasy trading in a demo account has many benefits, such as the ability to test and refine your trading strategies, experiment with different styles as well as try out different asset classes. Furthermore, with simulated trading, you can forward-test your strategy in real-time live markets.

Trading psychology is a major factor that can be the difference between success and failure in the markets. With no money at stake, fantasy trading lets you practice without the emotional stress and burnouts associated with trading, helping you to develop discipline before you transition your strategies to real-money trading.

BullRush Is More Than Just TradingBullRush is not just a trading platform – it's an interactive community where traders can learn, compete and grow together. In addition to the games and tournaments, BullRush also offers trading courses, tutorials and trading analysis.

This fantasy trading game is not just about winning money; it's also about learning to trade effectively while having fun in a dynamic, interactive environment.
