# Goodway Group Secures Meta Media Certification: Elevating Expertise, Enhancing Efficiency, and Maximizing Media Investments as Meta Drives 21% of U.S. Ad Spend in 2024

Goodway Group, a leading digital marketing agency, proudly announces that we have achieved Meta Media Certification. This prestigious recognition from Meta confirms our proven digital expertise and solidifies our position as an industry leader, enhancing our ability to deliver more efficient, effective campaigns that maximize our clients’ media investments for better outcomes.

As reported by eMarketer, Meta—the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and more—is a dominant force in the U.S. and global advertising landscape. With a projected $64.63 billion in U.S. ad revenues in 2024, Meta is expected to account for 21.3% of U.S. digital ad spend and 74.5% of U.S. social network ad spend, according to a March 2024 eMarketer forecast.

To achieve this top-tier certification, agencies must meet stringent standards, including maintaining a minimum of 20 active certifications or 20% of the team being certified, whichever is higher. Goodway Group has now met and exceeded these criteria with 73% of eligible team members being certified, earning recognition from Meta for our exceptional digital expertise. Our certified team members possess deep knowledge of Meta’s platforms, which is crucial for driving greater buying efficiency and ensuring that every dollar our clients invest is optimized for maximum return.

Goodway Group is uniquely positioned to leverage Meta’s advanced tools and insights, enabling us to deliver exceptional value through our Outcome Engineering approach. Meta's platforms are a core component in holistic omni-channel marketing for a more connected online customer journey, with Meta apps boasting 3 billion people using their products. This certification is validation that Goodway Group is better equipped to harness Meta’s full potential, ensuring that our clients’ media investments are fully maximized to yield the best possible outcomes.

Our relationship with Meta has already delivered significant results. For instance, in a recently published joint case study, Goodway Group: Meta Business Partner Conversions API Success Story, we detailed our collaboration with Tacori, a leading jewelry brand. Tacori aimed to improve overall campaign performance by achieving more granular tracking of conversion events across their websites and eCommerce platforms. By utilizing Meta’s Conversions API (CAPI) Gateway, we helped Tacori increase bookings to view jewelry for purchase by 18% and reduce costs with a 27% decrease in CPMs. This case study highlights the tangible benefits of our Meta Media Certification and how it directly contributes to our clients' success.

“Being recognized as a Meta Media Certified Company is a significant milestone for Goodway Group,” said Stephani Estes, Chief Media Officer at Goodway Group. “This certification not only validates the exceptional talent of our team but also strengthens our ability to deliver top-tier results for our clients. As we continue to innovate and push the boundaries of digital marketing, our partnership with Meta will be instrumental in helping us achieve new heights of success.”

Goodway Group's Meta Media Certification provides our clients with the assurance that their campaigns are managed by experts who have been rigorously tested and certified by one of the world's leading digital platforms. This recognition solidifies our standing in the marketplace and further positions us as a leader in delivering innovative, outcome-driven digital marketing solutions that maximize buying efficiency and protect our clients’ investments.
