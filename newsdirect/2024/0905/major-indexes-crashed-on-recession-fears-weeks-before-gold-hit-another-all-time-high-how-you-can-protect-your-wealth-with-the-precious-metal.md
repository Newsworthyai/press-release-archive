So far in 2024, the financial markets have experienced a healthy dose of turbulence, leaving many investors questioning where to safely allocate their capital. On August 5, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), often referred to as Wall Street's “fear gauge,” saw its largest single-day surge in history, largely due to a massive leverage unwind of the yen carry trade and escalating investor fears over a potential U.S. recession.

The VIX spiked to a high of 65.73, a level not seen since the market turmoil of March 2020. Understandably, this surge shook investor confidence, particularly as it coincided with continued softening in the labor market and sharp declines in major indices like the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq. As economic uncertainty continues to loom, many are reassessing their portfolios and seeking assets that can provide security. In this context, gold has emerged as a potentially compelling choice, offering some refuge from the volatility that has rattled traditional equity markets.

The Benefits Of Holding GoldGold has historically been regarded as a “safe-haven” asset, and its appeal has only grown in the face of 2024’s market volatility. Unlike stocks and bonds, gold is not directly tied to the performance of a specific company or government, making it less vulnerable to economic downturns. In 2024, the stability of gold has proven itself in spades when compared to the performance of popular exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) and iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM).

For example, during a particularly volatile period between July and August 2024, the SPY fell 10% while QQQ saw an even more dramatic 16% drop. In contrast, gold's steepest decline in 2024 was a relatively modest 6.4% between May and June. This resilience highlights gold’s ability to preserve value even when traditional markets are in turmoil. As a result, gold may serve as an effective portfolio diversifier, helping to reduce overall portfolio volatility and help protect against significant losses during market drawdowns.

Gold Pushing To Record HighsGold’s performance in 2024 has been nothing short of exceptional. On August 21, gold prices reached a fresh record high, closing above $2,500 per ounce. This surge has been driven by multiple factors, including ongoing concerns about inflation, deficit spending and a weakening U.S. dollar. Additionally, the anticipation of the Federal Reserve’s long-awaited cutting cycle – signaled by Chairman Jerome Powell’s dovish Jackson Hole remarks – has also helped fuel the rally in gold prices. Lower real interest rates typically boost the price of gold as it becomes more attractive relative to interest-bearing assets.

Meanwhile, central banks have also played a significant role in driving demand for gold, with purchases surpassing typical levels due to global economic uncertainties. Geopolitical tensions, particularly conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, have only added to the allure of gold as a store of value, making it an essential component of a diversified investment portfolio in 2024.
