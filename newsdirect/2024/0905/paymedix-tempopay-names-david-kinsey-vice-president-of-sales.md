# PayMedix/TempoPay Names David Kinsey Vice President of Sales

PayMedix/TempoPay announced today the appointment of David Kinsey as Vice President of Sales. Kinsey joins during a period of accelerated growth for PayMedix/TempoPay, which delivers innovative healthcare payment solutions that provide interest-free financing to employees for healthcare services, no matter their credit histories.

Kinsey brings an extensive background in the healthcare and employee benefits industry. In his new role, Kinsey will lead sales initiatives, focused on driving growth of the PayMedix/TempoPay solution and building strategic relationships across the healthcare industry with a specific focus on the Southeast region.

“As more health systems, employers, and benefits administrators across the country continue to look for ways to lower costs and provide affordable access to healthcare for employees, we're seeing increased interest in our flexible financing and payments solutions," said Tom Policelli, CEO of PayMedix/TempoPay. "David's extensive knowledge of healthcare sales and the employee benefits industry will help us increase our reach and ability to serve providers and employers looking for alternative healthcare payment solutions. We are excited to welcome him to our team."

Before his current role, Kinsey was an Executive Director at Aetna. He led the Healthcare Business Solutions team to achieve 60% growth over five years by directing enterprise sales, retention, and membership growth strategy. Kinsey was awarded Aetna's Chairman's Leadership Award for his leadership and collaboration. Kinsey’s prior roles at Aetna included working with employer groups and consultants on innovative employee benefits strategies and plan administration. Prior to Aetna, he was a Senior Client Manager at Cigna Healthcare, where he was awarded the Gold Circle for top sales results. He earned his BBA in Finance from Stetson University.

"The PayMedix/TempoPay solution is a game-changer, offering a straightforward and effective approach to tackling the demanding issue of high out-of-pocket healthcare costs," said Kinsey. "I look forward to working with the team to expand our reach and bring employers a financial safety net for their employees that ultimately improves retention and reduces absenteeism.”

“Having worked with David previously, I am confident in his ability to help employers, PEOs, health plans and network builders see the value in our solution,” said Brian Marsella, President, PayMedix/TempoPay. “By ensuring individuals have access to financial resources to get care when they need versus when they think they can afford it, we can break the cycle of care avoidance, which historically has led to sicker patients entering the system, worse outcomes and increased costs.”
