# Proven Leadership Team With A History Of Unlocking Shareholder Value Could Drive Railtown AI Higher

Back in July, CrowdStrike released a configuration update for their Falcon sensor, which inadvertently caused a system crash on Windows systems across the world. This issue was triggered by a logic error in the update that affected systems running Falcon Sensor for Windows, which resulted in downloading the faulty configuration during a specific timeframe.

The fallout was immediate and widespread, impacting banks, airlines, and various other critical sectors globally. Systems crashed, operations halted, and organizations were left scrambling to restore functionality. This disruption also opened the door for cybercriminals to exploit the situation, as they began distributing phishing emails and malicious files masquerading as solutions to the issue.

In what’s been described as the largest IT outage in history that cost Fortune 500 companies alone more than $5 billion in direct losses, according to one insurer’s analysis of the incident, one under-the-radar company seems well positioned to prevent the possibility of such events in the future, thus attracting significant investor interest.

Railtown AI Technologies (CSE:RAIL) (OTCQB:RLAIF) is a promising player in the AI sector, offering innovative solutions that streamline software development. As a Microsoft Partner, Railtown AI has developed a cloud-based Application General Intelligence (AGI) platform designed to support software developers and Agile teams.

The company’s main objective is to leverage artificial intelligence to catch errors before they reach production, and here’s how it could have mitigated the issues faced by CrowdStrike:

* Automated Code Analysis: Railtown AI employs advanced machine learning algorithms to perform continuous and automated analysis of code. This enables the company to detect anomalies and potential errors that might be missed during manual reviews through alerts.
* Predictive Insights: The AI-driven platform not only identifies existing errors but also predicts areas of code that are more likely to contain future issues. This predictive capability helps developers focus their attention where it’s needed most.
* Integration with Development Tools: Railtown AI seamlessly integrates with popular development environments and CI/CD pipelines, ensuring that error detection is an integral part of the development process, not an afterthought.
* Enhanced Security: By identifying and addressing vulnerabilities early, Railtown AI enhances the security posture of software, reducing the risk of exploitation and ensuring user trust and safety.

In addition to that, Railtown also helps assist developers to save time on repetitive tasks, improve productivity, reduce costs, and accelerate developer velocity. This platform is readily accessible via Microsoft's Azure Marketplace, making it easily available to a broad range of businesses.

Although there’s been a lot of hype surrounding how AI companies could disrupt the future of coding and programming, investors need to be aware that not all AI companies will turn out to be the next unicorn. Picking out a winner in the sector is particularly challenging due to the rapid pace of advancement as well as the increasing complexity of the capabilities of these systems, making it hard for non-tech people to comprehend.

However, one strategy that has worked for savvy investors across different sectors of the market has been looking at the founders or leadership track record in creating shareholder value. A closer look at Railtown reveals that it has a proven leadership team with a history of driving growth for shareholders, which should bode well for the company’s stock.

For starters, Railtown co-founder and CTO Marwan Haddad has over 25 years of software development experience in addition to 10 years of experience leading and building high-performance engineering and product development teams. He was the Chief Technology Officer and Vice President of Engineering for RESAAS, a global award-winning proptech cloud platform.

He has also led the development efforts/teams and launched several platforms for Fortune 500 companies, including Microsoft and Starbucks.

CEO Cory Brandolini has over 30 years of experience as a founder, partner, angel investor, financier, and advisor to disruptive, high-growth software companies within the technology industry. His wealth of capital markets experience includes helping raise well over $150 million for private and public technology companies.

Co-founder Dr. Elliot Holtham has a wide range of experience in natural sciences, engineering, and technology. While he has a passion for developing innovative technology, his strong work ethic and competitive drive have also enabled him to advise and lead groups to success. Previously, he was co-founder, CEO, and COO of Xtract AI, a machine learning company that was later acquired by Patriot One Technologies (TSX:XTRA) for about $6 million.

Last but not least is Kevin O'Neil, who has over 35 years of experience in technology investing, advisory, and leadership. He was formerly the CEO of Xtract AI and also an investment banker at Merrill Lynch.

More importantly, Railtown AI's proprietary platform is entirely owned and developed in-house, ensuring that the company has complete control over its technology. The platform offers dual deployment options, catering to organizations with different needs by offering both cloud-based and on-premise solutions. This flexibility, combined with the platform's ability to process data quickly and learn over time, allows businesses to make real-time decisions and continuously improve their software development processes.

Additionally, Railtown AI's focus on compliance with industry standards such as SOC 2, GDPR, and ISO 27001 is a significant advantage, as these compliance achievements build customer trust by ensuring that the platform handles data responsibly and securely.

Railtown AI has achieved several milestones, reaffirming that its business model has been validated by the market. These include the company’s recently announced debt-free status and strengthening of its capital base through private placements. Clearly, those achievements, combined with strategic partnerships with leading institutions like the Mila Quebec AI Institute and Amii Alberta Machine Learning Institute, set the stage for future growth.

Going forward, we believe that Railtown AI is poised to capitalize on its strong leadership team to unlock shareholder value as the company positions itself to rapidly scale user acquisition and commercialize new features on the platform.
