The Crossroads Summit, scheduled to take place Nov. 21-22 in Miami, Florida, is billed as a conference for savvy investors and business leaders. Summit attendees will hear from visionaries in a number of disciplines, from academia to investment research. A central theme will be the role of rapid change in propelling innovations that create opportunity.

Neil Howe: Navigating The Era Of Crisis And RenewalOne of the visionaries recruited to speak at the Crossroads Summit is Neil Howe, an authority on generational trends. He is an economist and demographer, as well as a historian and sociologist.

Howe is a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Global Aging Institute, both in Washington, D.C. He is the Managing Director of Demography at Hedgeye Risk Management and his human resources and strategic planning consulting firm, LifeCourse Associates, has served hundreds of corporate, government and nonprofit clients.

The author of several books on “generational theory”, which argues that history repeats itself in 80 to 100-year cycles, Howe will share his insights on how these turning points impact America's ability to invest in its future.

In his latest book, “The Fourth Turning Is Here,” Howe shows that America is currently in the last stage of one of these long cycles. He describes past turnings as “traumatic and transformative” and notes that they “dramatically reshape attitudes, behaviors, and the future of society.”

Howe will lead a fireside chat at the Crossroads Summit, sponsored by TradeStation Group, that will delve into what the current stage of these cyclical patterns implies for America’s present and future.

Howe Among Many Experts To Speak At The Crossroads SummitMore than a dozen speakers, all experts in their respective fields, will address attendees at the Crossroads Summit. Each will focus on how turmoil like what Howe identifies will inspire the innovative solutions that could drive future investment opportunities.

The conference is intended to help investors learn how to adjust their investing strategies to focus on future themes such as the end of near-zero interest rates, immigration policy, changes in the domestic workforce and new investable products.

Fireside chats and panel discussions are intended to offer attendees investable insights by uncovering the hidden trends and critical developments that are driving world markets and economies.

TradeStation Group is the title sponsor of the Crossroads Summit. Ticket packages are available at the Crossroads Summit website.

TradeStation Group’s Sponsorship In The Crossroads SummitThe Crossroads Summit was created to help business leaders and investors cut through the current clutter of information.

Today’s world is facing unprecedented challenges and disruption with advancements in artificial intelligence, political and economic uncertainty, an increase in armed conflict and rapid changes in technologies like cryptocurrency and fintech innovations.

The Crossroads Summit is intended to be a catalyst for uncovering investment opportunities. As such, it was a natural fit that a global financial services company like TradeStation Group should present the conference.

TradeStation Group aims to offer investors comprehensive market access and high-quality trade execution. The platform provides trading capabilities in stocks, options, mutual funds, and ETFs. TradeStation Group’s sponsorship of the Summit appropriately dovetails its capabilities with the needs of attendees.
