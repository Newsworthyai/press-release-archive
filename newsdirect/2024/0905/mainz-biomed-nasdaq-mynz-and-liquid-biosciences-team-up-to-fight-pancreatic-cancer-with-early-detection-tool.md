Mainz Biomed N.V. (NASDAQ: MYNZ), a molecular genetics diagnostic company specializing in the early detection of cancer, has inked a collaboration deal with Liquid Biosciences, an AI-focused bio-analytics company, to potentially add pancreatic cancer detection to its colorectal cancer screening test ColoAlert®. Liquid Biosciences leverages its EMERGE AI analysis technology platform to help biopharma companies, diagnostics industries and academic institutions identify effective drugs and therapies.

Mainz Biomed is developing PancAlert, a screening test that combines genetic and potentially microbiome biomarkers to detect pancreatic cancer. Research has shown that the microbiome – the mix of bacteria in the gut – plays a big role in how tumors develop and progress. The constitution of the microbiome can potentially hurt the immune system’s ability to recognize and attack cancer and render drugs less effective. By combining DNA and microbiome biomarkers, Mainz is betting early detection of pancreatic cancer is possible.

Promising Early ResultsIn the initial phase of the collaboration, the companies evaluated biomarkers from Mainz’s research program, co-funded by the German government, by applying a single algorithm developed by Liquid Biosciences using its EMERGE platform. Mainz said the results of the feasibility analysis were promising, giving both companies confidence that PancAlert could be added to ColoAlert in the future. ColoAlert is an early detection screening that spots bleeding and non-bleeding tumors through tumor DNA analysis, offering what the company says is a better early detection than fecal occult blood tests.

In the second phase of the collaboration, Mainz and Liquid Biosciences will expand the biomarker evaluation to include microbiome biomarkers Mainz evaluated in 2023 and an expansion of the algorithm. The companies are targeting to complete this analysis in the fourth quarter of 2024.

“We are excited by the opportunity to collaborate with Liquid Biosciences on PancAlert, which is being developed for early-stage disease detection with the goal of being a first-in-class screening test for this deadly form of cancer,” said Guido Baechler, Chief Executive Officer of Mainz Biomed. “Liquid Biosciences is already a key partner in our Next Generation colorectal cancer screening test. Expanding our partnership will allow us to bring the power of AI to this critical problem.”

Pancreatic Cancer Is Deadly And Growing Pancreatic cancer is a malignant neoplasm of the pancreas with one of the highest mortality rates of all major cancers. It is now the third-leading cause of cancer deaths, and by 2030 it is expected to grow to second place, surpassing colorectal cancer deaths. This year alone, about 66,440 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, a record for this deadly form of cancer. What’s more, about 51,750 Americans are expected to die from the disease this year.

Among cancers, pancreatic disease is a tough one to treat. It’s a highly aggressive form of cancer that attacks the pancreas, an organ needed for digestion. With limited treatment options, the five-year survival rate is just 13%. It doesn’t help that most people are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in a late stage when it has already spread to other parts of the body. That’s particularly true with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which is a type of pancreatic cancer that’s created from the cells that line the ducts of the pancreas. It's one of the most lethal forms of pancreatic cancer.

Given the difficulty in treating pancreatic cancer and the increasing incidents, a lot of medical research is directed toward earlier detection and better treatments. As a result, the global pancreatic cancer market is projected to reach $7.4 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 13.7% over 2023-2032.

Mainz’s collaboration with Liquid Biosciences is the latest in the company’s collaborations to bring its next-generation diagnostics technology to the masses. By combining biomarkers, Mainz is seeking to demonstrate a better and more effective way to spot deadly cancers that currently go undetected and untreated until it's too late.
