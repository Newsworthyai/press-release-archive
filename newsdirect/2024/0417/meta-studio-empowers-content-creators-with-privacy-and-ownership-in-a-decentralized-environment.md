META STUDIO, operating as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), has empowered content creators to sell their content with complete privacy, and retain ownership, while actively participating in decision-making processes alongside their peers. META STUDIO offers a versatile platform catering to various digital content formats for content creators, streamers, coaches, or freelancers

META STUDIO bolsters democratic governance, where creators, users, investors, and $METAS token holders collectively shape the platform's trajectory. Transparency remains paramount, with creators retaining 100% ownership of assets and income, and minimal platform costs distributed proportionally.

From individual products and services to comprehensive packages and subscriptions encompassing text, video, live training, and more, META STUDIO provides a platform for creators to monetize their content. META STUDIO identified the pervasive challenges prevailing in the industry. These include unfair regulations, exorbitant commissions, and a concerning lack of privacy leading to numerous personal data breaches.

META STUDIO's primary goal is to revolutionize the landscape of content creation within the blockchain space. Recognizing the exponential growth and potential of the creators' market, estimated at $250 billion in 2022 and projected to reach $500 billion by 2027 according to Goldman Sachs, META STUDIO aims to address the pressing issues faced by content creators.

Mugur Frunzetti, the CEO of META STUDIO, about their plans stated “We are now over 65 in the app development and on the right track for a full launch this summer, more specifically in August 2024. For 2025 we plan to reach a turnover of over $ 5 billion, by attracting at least 20% of the content creators who also use a crypto wallet in daily payments. The community's response to our project is incredible, almost 99% of the creators we reached out to are waiting with excitement to use the METASTUDIO mobile app, a platform built for them, where they will take 100% of all decisions, from rules to finances. We also expect people who never tried selling content before to our project, this transformative journey towards a decentralized digital future.”

META STUDIO democratizes content creation within a decentralized and engaging environment by bridging the gap between the Web2 and Web3 eras. While the immersive Metaverse experience remains on the horizon, META STUDIO prioritizes addressing immediate challenges using existing Web3 technology.
