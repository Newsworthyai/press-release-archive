--News Direct--

NextSource Materials Executive Vice President Brent Nykoliation joined Steve Darling from Proactive to unveil the latest advancements in the development of the company's Battery Anode Facility (BAF) located in the Freeport Zone of the port of Port-Louis, Mauritius. Through meticulous planning and a rigorous site selection process, NextSource Materials has achieved a significant milestone by securing a long-term lease agreement for the site, marking a pivotal step forward in the establishment of its inaugural BAF plant.

Nykoliation elaborated on the company's progress, highlighting the integration of engineering enhancements into the plant's design and the initiation of the environmental permitting process (EIA). This strategic approach underscores NextSource Materials' commitment to adhering to stringent environmental standards while ensuring operational efficiency and sustainability.

In a testament to its forward-thinking approach, the company has pre-ordered process equipment boasting a production capacity of 3,600 tonnes per annum of spheronized and purified graphite, a critical component in battery anode production. The fabrication and assembly of this cutting-edge equipment are currently underway offshore, with plans for shipment to Mauritius upon the completion of the EIA process. Concurrently, NextSource Materials has already taken delivery of SuperFlake graphite concentrate from the Molo Mine and essential equipment for the operation of a small-scale pilot line at the site. This proactive measure aims to streamline the production of samples for key original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers, thereby accelerating the commercialization process.

Looking ahead, NextSource Materials is poised to unveil an updated economic assessment for the BAF site, offering stakeholders a comprehensive overview of the project's financial viability and potential returns. The forthcoming announcement reflects the company's unwavering commitment to transparency and accountability, providing investors with valuable insights into the economic prospects of its operations.
