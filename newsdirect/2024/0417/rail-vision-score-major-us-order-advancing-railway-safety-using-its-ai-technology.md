--News Direct--

Rail Vision CEO Shahar Hania joined Steve Darling from Proactive to share exciting news about the company securing an order for its innovative AI-powered Switch Yard System from a Class 1 freight rail company in North America. This order, previously announced, marks a significant milestone for Rail Vision as it expands into the North American market and sets a new standard for safety and efficiency in rail operations. The freight rail company, one of the largest in North America, will install and evaluate the system on its locomotive to test various safety scenarios.

Hania explained that Rail Vision's Switch Yard System utilizes electro-optic sensors combined with AI, machine learning, and Advanced Driver Assistance System solutions to address limited vision issues, extending the range of sight and reducing downtime. By enhancing punctuality, efficiency, and safety, the system aims to revolutionize rail operations.

This announcement comes shortly after Rail Vision received another order for its AI-driven Switch Yard System from Loram, a leading US-based provider of railway track maintenance equipment and services. The order from Loram serves as a pilot project to integrate Rail Vision's advanced technology into Loram's rail track maintenance operations. This collaboration underscores both companies' commitment to advancing railway safety and operational efficiency.

If the pilot project proves successful, Rail Vision and Loram will explore opportunities to expand their collaboration, potentially integrating Rail Vision's innovative solutions into Loram's service offerings across the United States. This strategic partnership highlights the potential for Rail Vision's technology to make a significant impact on the railway industry's safety and efficiency standards.
