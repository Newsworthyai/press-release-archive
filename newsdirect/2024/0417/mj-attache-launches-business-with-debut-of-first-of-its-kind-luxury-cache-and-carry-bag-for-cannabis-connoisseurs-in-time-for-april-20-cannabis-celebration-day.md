MJ Attaché’s bags are market-disrupting; they boast patent-pending modular elements -- not found in any other bag -- that encourage a personalized cannabis experience specific to each one’s individual consumption needs. Catering to both male and female cannabis users, The Anthony’s novel magnetic, re-attachable accessories are fully customizable. Elements inside the bag can be easily added or deleted, depending on what each user prefers for their cannabis self-care ritual.

Cleverly crafted by hand in Florence, Italy of the finest Italian leather, The Anthony’s features distinguish it from any other cannabis carry-all bag currently available in the market. Available in five colors, The Anthony bag includes a secure lock closure, removable smooth leather rolling tray, modular elements for customization, such as a pipe case, lighter sleeve, jar sleeve a smell-proof glass jar and a removable, adjustable crossbody strap. The combination of the leather and smell-proof jar aids in disguising odors and keep contents discreet.

The MJ Attaché brand challenges outdated, inaccurate stereotypes of cannabis consumers by offering mainstream users a way to elevate their cache-and-carry preferences and experiences. Cannabis has come a long way from its prior perceptions, and MJ Attaché recognizes its broader adoption by users spanning the spectrum.

Like many entrepreneurs, ideas are often spurred by personal experience. MJ Attaché is no exception. Founder Christy Fuicelli created the brand and designed its premium bag when she was personally searching for a sophisticated, safe and discreet carry-all solution for her cannabis and accessories. She came up emptyhanded when shopping for options of the same high-quality, sophistication and style to which she was accustomed. Fuicelli believed this void in the marketplace stemmed from stigmas associated with overall cannabis use and she set out to change the market landscape with the design, development and introduction of The Anthony.

“I went on a crusade to create a stylish, luxury, handcrafted bag many would be proud to carry. With its impeccable style, quality Italian leather components and customizable modular system, The Anthony bag transcends the outdated “stoner” stereotypes cannabis users are often perceived as and creates the ultimate luxury cannabis experience. I travelled on this journey witnessing nearly a dozen iterations of The Anthony until I was pleased because I could not find a functional, sophisticated, stylish and well-made cannabis transport option, which sparked my interest in developing one myself,” entrepreneur Fuicelli said.

“Additionally, I was determined to challenge preconceived notions relating to cannabis use stereotypes. Many people use cannabis medicinally as well as to reduce stress and anxiety and promote relaxation. For me, my cannabis use not only helped alleviate certain medical conditions but also can be directly attributed to the deep creativity it ignited in me, sparking my idea for The Anthony and other bags and accessories in the MJ Attaché product line. I am hoping adoption of The Anthony and other MJ Attaché offerings will simplify the lives of cannabis users around the world. The Anthony truly marks an entry into a market where no other bag like it exists,” Fuicelli concluded.

The Anthony, with a price point of $2,150.00, can be purchased here. Looking ahead, MJ Attaché is currently developing other cannabis bag styles and accessories, which are slated for introduction into the marketplace in the latter part of 2024.
