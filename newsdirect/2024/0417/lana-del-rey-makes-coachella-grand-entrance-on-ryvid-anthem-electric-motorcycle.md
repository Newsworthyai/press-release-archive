Once the artist and her production team decided to create a dramatic entrance by arriving on the back of a motorcycle, they had to navigate a number of obstacles. For starters, the Fire Marshal wouldn’t allow conventional combustion engines to be used on safety grounds. They also stipulated the bikes couldn’t be ridden at more than 5mph. In fact, they needed assurances that the motorcycles couldn’t exceed that speed!

Considering the stipulations, the production team quickly turned to the California-built Ryvid Anthem Electric Motorcycle. Firstly, its 4.3 kWh Battery Pack would ensure the performers and audience didn’t succumb to exhaust fumes. Secondly, Ryvid engineers were able to limit the Anthem to exactly 5mph through its electronic controller – reduced from the 75mph+ available for unrestricted use. And thirdly, the lightweight 313 lb Anthem – with its high-performance brakes, suspension and tires – allowed the riders to control the bikes with their standing passengers. And the Anthem’s low center of gravity made balancing with the passenger far easier than almost any other motorcycle, electric or otherwise.

Undoubtedly, the Ryvid Anthem was the perfect bike for Lana and her production team. Priced at only $8,995 and available in six eye-catching colors, it’s also perfect for commuting and urban exploration. Equipped with an integrated charger, 75-mile range, two riding modes, modern styling, and much more, the Anthem is available for delivery now.
