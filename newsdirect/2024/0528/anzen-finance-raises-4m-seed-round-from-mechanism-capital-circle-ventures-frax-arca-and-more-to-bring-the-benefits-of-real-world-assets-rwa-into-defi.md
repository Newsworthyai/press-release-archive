# Anzen Finance Raises $4M Seed Round from Mechanism Capital, Circle Ventures, Frax, Arca and More to Bring the Benefits of Real-World Assets (RWA) into DeFi

Anzen Finance, the decentralized platform creating USDz, a digital dollar backed by Real World Assets (RWA), has raised $4 million in seed funding. This investment round, led by top-tier investors including Mechanism Capital, Circle Ventures, Frax, Arca, Infinity Ventures, Cherubic Ventures, Palm Drive Ventures, M31 Capital, Kraynos Capital, and several other prominent backers, marks a significant milestone in Anzen's mission to integrate Real World Assets (RWA) into the DeFi ecosystem.

The fresh capital will accelerate Anzen's development of its protocol and the expansion of its product offerings. By leveraging RWAs, Anzen aims to create a sustainable yield ecosystem, establishing a much-needed connection to high-quality assets within the real economy. This innovative approach is set to bring stability and new use cases to DeFi, unlocking a multi-trillion-dollar market opportunity.

“This infusion of capital from such a stellar line-up of backers is a huge vote of confidence in Anzen’s vision for seamlessly integrating the real economy with the DeFi ecosystem and creating opportunities for users to diversify their portfolios while earning sustainable staking rewards,” said Anzen Finance founder Ben Shyong.

Anzen’s protocol, live on Ethereum and Base, allows users to mint USDz, a digital token backed by a diversified portfolio of private credit assets. These assets, sourced from qualified and KYC-compliant investors, are rigorously underwritten to ensure their reliability and value, even amid cryptocurrency market volatility.

With the introduction of USDz, Anzen offers a scalable digital dollar that is overcollateralized by cash-flowing RWAs, primarily asset-backed private securities, a major component of the $7 trillion US private credit market. USDz is backed by 1 USD or more worth of on-chain RWA collateral at all times. It’s freely traded on decentralized exchanges, where it can be swapped for stablecoins like USDT or USDC.

This token is permissionless, composable, and can be staked for rewards across various DeFi protocols. By using tokens backed by real collateral, users can diversify their portfolios and mitigate the risks of unbacked crypto tokens.

Anzen Finance is poised to bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance, bringing together the best of both worlds.
