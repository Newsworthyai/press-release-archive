It is powered by Comply Pro, one of New Zealand's fastest-growing SAAS companies, used by over 5,500 organisations and over 45,000 users across Australasia and Canada.

The partnership marks the brands’ joint commitment to improving workplace safety by supporting safety professionals in their important work. Site App Pro has been integrated with AuditSoft to streamline the experience for its auditor users, enabling them to easily import critical safety documents without the hassle of manual data transfer.

“We’re committed to making life easier for our users. By integrating with popular apps they already use to manage safety documentation, we’re saving them that extra bit of time and headache,” said Peter Spence, VP of Partnerships at AuditSoft.

“Site App Pro shares our mission to streamline workplace safety and we look forward to working with them to educate organisations on the importance of digital transformation. The safety and compliance industry is changing and organisations need get ahead and embrace the power of digital automation and data in evolving occupational health and safety.”

"We’re really excited to be joining AuditSoft’s network,” said Ryan Hartley, Chief Revenue Officer at Site App Pro. “AuditSoft has a strong and growing presence across North America and we look forward to working with them to transform safety and compliance and add value to the industry.”
