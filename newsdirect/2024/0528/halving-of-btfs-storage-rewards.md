![](https://public.newsdirect.com/721081393/9efaxA7V.png)

Singapore, May 28, 2024 –To sustain the growth and success of the BitTorrent ecosystem, BTFS is set to implement a halving on the next round of rewards for storage miners on the BTFS network. From 00:00 (UTC) June 25, 2024, the daily rewards for storage miners on the BTFS network will be halved from 15 billion BTT to 7.5 billion BTT.

The BitTorrent File System (BTFS) is a decentralized file storage system that utilizes blockchain technology and peer-to-peer transmission. It allows users to store their files across multiple nodes in a distributed manner, enhancing file security and reliability. BTFS also offers rapid file transfer and access, giving users greater convenience in managing and sharing files. By integrating key features of the BitTorrent Chain (BTTC), such as cross-chain connectivity and multichannel payment options, BTFS significantly enhances user experience.

Currently, the BTFS network is experiencing rapid growth with over 8 million nodes across the network, including more than 6 million super miners, according to BTFS SCAN. To support the efficient operations of these nodes, BTFS initiated a rewards program and has provided an aggregate of 25 trillion BTT since the launch of BTFS Mainnet in 2019.

Every two years, the BTFS rewards halving will occur causing the rewards for all storage miners across the network to be cut in half.

Moreover, halving will also prompt miners to improve node performance by optimizing node operation and reducing waste.

In addition, an upgrade of the official website for the BTFS technical community and the release of BTFS v3.0 Mainnet will be scheduled in sync with the halving. These developments are expected to improve the efficiency of the BTFS protocol, expand the user base, and enhance its overall functionality.

Looking ahead, BTFS is committed to continuously refining its storage rewards strategies. The goal is to expand the network of nodes participating in file storage on BTFS, providing developers with an efficient, secure, and reliable storage solution boosting both the capacity and the transaction efficiency of the BTTC network.
