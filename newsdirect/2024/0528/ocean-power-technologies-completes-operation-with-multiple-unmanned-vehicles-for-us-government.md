# Ocean Power Technologies completes Operation with Multiple Unmanned Vehicles for US Government

Ocean Power Technologies CEO Philipp Stratmann joined Steve Darling from Proactive to reveal the company has completed a major contractual milestone and concluded operation of several simultaneously deployed WAM-Vs for a Department of the US Government. This milestone enables immediate revenue recognition.

This demonstration was conducted with a department of the US government, although specific details were not disclosed due to security reasons. Stratmann emphasised the importance of such practical demonstrations to validate the company's claims and capabilities to both current and potential future customers. Significant planning and operational coordination were involved, including collaboration with subcontractors and the execution of field operations to meet customer requirements.

This milestone builds on other recent multi-system deliveries and contract awards. This completion, the company says, is a testament to the utility of its unmanned surface vehicles and the skills of our operators. OPT is now looking forward to future operations and generating incremental value for our customers and shareholders.
