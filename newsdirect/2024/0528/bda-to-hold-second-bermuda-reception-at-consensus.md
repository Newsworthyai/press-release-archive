# BDA To Hold Second Bermuda Reception at Consensus

The Bermuda Business Development Agency (BDA) will hold its second Bermuda Reception at Consensus, the world’s largest gathering of digital asset, blockchain and Web3 enthusiasts in Austin, Texas this week.

Kendaree Burgess, COO of the BDA said, “Bermuda continues to build on its reputation as a global thought leader in the realm of robust yet pragmatic digital asset regulation and supervision, as recently evidenced by the appointment of Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, to the board of the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA).”

Ms. Burgess continued, “Our Bermuda reception provides all local delegates and their guests the opportunity to take a virtual lap around Hamilton, with organisations like the BMA, service providers and government all present. The accessibility of the event mimics the ease of doing business and making connections in Bermuda.”

Bermuda’s reception will be held on Thursday, May 30 from 5pm to 7.30pm. Attendees will enjoy Bermuda entertainment and could win a weekend trip for two to Bermuda courtesy of BermudAir and The Loren Hotels. Email events@bda.bm to RSVP.

During their time at Consensus, the BDA and other members of the Bermuda delegation will hold business development meetings with key leaders expressing an interest in setting up operations in Bermuda.
