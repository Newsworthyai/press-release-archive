# Xigem Technologies Reports Strong Q1 Financial Performance Driven by EchoDigital

Xigem Technologies CEO Brian Kalish joined Steve Darling from Proactive to discuss the companyâ€™s impressive Q1 financial results. The company reported gross sales of $694,307 and net sales of $20,830 for the first fiscal quarter of 2024. This compares to gross sales of $439,684 and net sales of $13,191 in the first fiscal quarter of 2023, representing an approximate 58% increase in both cases. Additionally, the company reduced its net comprehensive loss for the first fiscal quarter of 2024 by 65.5% compared to the same period in 2023.

Kalish attributed the strong sales performance to EchoDigital, a SaaS-based platform currently employed by a used car dealer in the Greater Toronto Area. EchoDigital uses proprietary AI to seamlessly generate and convert leads from traditional sources. The AI assesses and qualifies leads, determining their psychological aptitude and matching them with the most suitable and qualified customer service/sales representatives (CSRs) to complete sales online. Xigem plans to expand EchoDigital to other used car dealers in the near future.
