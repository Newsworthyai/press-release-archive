# Australian Strategic Materials signs US$600 million LoI

--News Direct--

Rowena Smith, CEO and managing director of Australian Strategic Materials Ltd (ASX:ASM), joins Jonathan Jackson in the Proactive studio to discuss the companyâ€™ s Dubbo Project, in Central West New South Wales. This project aims to extract and process critical minerals and rare earth elements, crucial for various high-tech applications. Last week, the project received a significant boost with a Letter of Intent (LoI) for a US$600 million debt funding package from the Export-Import Bank of the United States, adding to a previous A$200 million Letter of Support from Export Finance Australia (EFA). This financial backing underscores the strategic importance of critical minerals and the global interest in securing supplies for future technological and industrial use. The Australian Government's focus on critical minerals reflects a broader international trend towards securing supply chains for essential resources, particularly those pivotal for technological advancements and sustainable development. Furthermore, ASM has contracted Bechtel Mining and Metals, Inc for Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) services. Bechtel will develop the project's engineering design, integrating its extensive experience in constructing large-scale industrial projects, which will enhance the project's feasibility and operational planning. This collaboration and the secured funding are pivotal steps towards completing a comprehensive feasibility study for the Dubbo Project, setting the stage for its development and operational phases.
