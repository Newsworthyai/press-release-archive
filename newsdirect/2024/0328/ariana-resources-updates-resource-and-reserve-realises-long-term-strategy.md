# Ariana Resources updates resource and reserve; realises long-term strategy

--News Direct--

Joining Jonathan Jackson in the Proactive studio is Ariana Resources plc (LON:AAU) managing director Kerim Sener, who sits down to discuss the latest resource and reserve update for the Zenit Mining Operations in Western Türkiye. The update encompasses the Kiziltepe and Tavsan sectors, operated by Zenit Madencilik in partnership with Proccea Construction and Ozaltin Holding, with Ariana owning a 23.5% stake.

The update reveals a JORC reserve of 5.3 million tonnes at 1.46 grams per tonne (g/t) of gold and 9.81 g/t of silver, totaling 249,000 ounces of gold and 1.67 million ounces of silver. This indicates a potential for approximately 10 more years of production.

Since 2017, the Kiziltepe Sector has produced 151,000 ounces of gold and 1.68 million ounces of silver. The global JORC resource now stands at 10.9 million tonnes, containing 483,000 ounces of gold and 4.45 million ounces of silver, with identified avenues for further resource growth.

Dr Sener shares insights on the long-term strategy of combining the Kiziltepe and Tavsan sectors for optimised ore processing, reflecting significant progress since the strategy's conceptualization in 2009. With a substantial increase in gold prices, the company is reassessing pit designs and processing options to extend the life and efficiency of the operations.

Investors can look forward to continued exploration efforts aimed at expanding the resource base, with Ariana Resources poised for strategic growth in Western Türkiye's mining sector.
