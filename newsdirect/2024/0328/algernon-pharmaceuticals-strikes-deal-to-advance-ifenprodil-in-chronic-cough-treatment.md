# Algernon Pharmaceuticals Strikes Deal to Advance Ifenprodil in Chronic Cough Treatment

--News Direct--

Algernon Pharmaceuticals CEO Christopher Moreau joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce a significant agreement regarding the company's drug, Ifenprodil with U.S. Based Seyltx. Originally discovered in Japan and not utilized in the US or Europe, Ifenprodil was initially developed to treat intermittent claudication but found application in Japan for vertigo post-stroke. Dr. Mark Williams, Algernon's co-founder, identified Ifenprodil's potential for repurposing in new markets, particularly for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and chronic cough, a symptom associated with IPF.

During the interview, Moreau disclosed that the company has entered into a transformative agreement with a private US firm, granting them rights to advance Ifenprodil through a Phase 2b study targeting chronic cough. This agreement provides Algernon with a 20% interest in the acquiring company and a $2 million U.S. cash infusion. This financial injection strengthens Algernon's financial position and enables it to focus on other projects, including a promising study on DMT for stroke treatment.

The agreement represents a pivotal moment for Algernon, positioning Ifenprodil for further development in a market with significant potential. Moreover, it allows Algernon to concentrate on advancing its broader drug development pipeline, ensuring the company remains at the forefront of innovation in the pharmaceutical industry.

In summary, the agreement concerning Ifenprodil marks a significant milestone for Algernon Pharmaceuticals, underscoring its commitment to advancing novel treatments and maximizing shareholder value. With a strengthened financial position and a focus on strategic initiatives, Algernon is well-positioned for future growth and success in the competitive pharmaceutical landscape.
