# U.S. Ferrosilicon Producers File Petitions to Stop Unfairly Traded Imports from Russia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, and Brazil

--News Direct--

CC Metals and Alloys, LLC (“CCMA”) and Ferroglobe USA, Inc. (“Ferroglobe”), representing all American ferrosilicon production, today filed petitions with the U.S. Department of Commerce (“Commerce”) and U.S. International Trade Commission (“ITC”) alleging that unfairly priced and subsidized ferrosilicon imports from Russia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, and Brazil are causing material injury to U.S. industry.

The antidumping and countervailing duty petitions detail unfair trade practices to sell ferrosilicon at less than fair value and allege dumping margins of up to 212%, as well as numerous subsidies. The petitions detail the extensive injury suffered by the U.S. industry and its workers, and request relief in the form of special duties on all associated imports.

“The onslaught of dumped imports from these countries over the last three years has caused serious harm to the U.S. industry, its workers, and the communities in which we operate,” said Marco Levi, Chief Executive Officer of Ferroglobe PLC. “A successful outcome in these cases will allow us to get back to work on a level playing field.”

“American producers can compete with anyone in the world, as long as we’re all playing by the same rules,” said Chris Cobb, CCMA’s plant manager. “Bringing these cases allows us to protect our colleagues, employees, and communities. Fortunately, our country’s trade laws are set up to support fair trade. On behalf of our employees, customers, and colleagues, we look forward to seeing those laws enforced and those who violate our laws held accountable.”

The cases filed today cover all types of ferrosilicon, regardless of chemistry, grade, or physical form.

After today’s filing, Commerce will initiate its antidumping and countervailing duty investigations by April 17, 2024, and the ITC is expected to make a preliminary injury determination by May 13, 2024.
