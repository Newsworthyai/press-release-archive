After experiencing the largest weekly drop in nearly six months, Bitcoin rebounded on March 25, briefly reaching $71,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at 70,590 USDT on HTX.

According to a report released by 10x Research, Bitcoin may surge to a new high of $83,000 after a period of consolidation. Ki Young Ju, the founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, has warned of a potential liquidity crisis among sellers within the next six months, citing the rapid net inflow of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which exceeded 30,000 BTC in early March. Should such a crisis occur, Bitcoin's next peak could surpass expectations due to limited seller liquidity and a thin order book.

Given Bitcoin's heightened anticipation and scarcity, leveraging its volatility for maximum returns is a crucial consideration for investors. In response to this, HTX has introduced the "Trade to Earn" event aimed at enriching trading experiences and offering users opportunities for asset growth.

Trade to Earn: HTX's Fee-Free Trading of BTC

The Trade to Earn event is a benefit for all trading users at the HTX exchange. After successful registration for this event, participants can earn $HTX as rewards by trading designated cryptocurrencies. Additionally, all daily trading fees generated will be fully utilized for $HTX buybacks to support stable appreciation. 100% of $HTX acquired through buybacks will be entirely burned.

Currently, the Trade to Earn event applies to BTC/USDT spot and futures trading. Participation in either trading type enables users to enjoy negative fee rates and stand a chance to share a daily prize pool of 100,000 USDT, respectively.

This event enhances the platform's liquidity through reduced trading costs and improved trading efficiency, offering users better trading experience. Meanwhile, the supply of $HTX will be decreased through the event to enhance its stability and value, which will help attract more investors and users to participate in ecosystem development.

Most importantly, this burning method also grants more earning opportunities for HTX DAO users. Through participation in liquidity mining and staking, users can receive more rewards in tokens, thereby achieving wealth appreciation.

A Guide to Trade to Earn: How to Grab 200,000 USDT Daily

According to HTX's announcements, the Trade to Earn event will conclude at 11:59:59 (UTC) on April 14, 2024, for the BTC/USDT spot trading and at 11:59:59 (UTC) on March 27, 2024, for the BTCUSDT perpetual futures trading. A daily prize pool of 100,000 USDT worth of $HTX will be distributed for each pair.

The event is on a daily basis. A day is defined from 12:00 (UTC) on Day T to 11:59 (UTC) on Day T+1. For spot trades, rewards will be calculated and updated starting on Day T+2 at 04:00 (UTC), and users can claim their $HTX at any time. For futures trades, rewards will be credited to winners' HTX spot accounts within 3 working days after the end of each round.

Trade to Earn is open to all HTX users, including market makers and API traders. To participate in Spot "Trade to Earn", you must have at least 300 Rockets and register on the event page. For the futures event, you must have at least 10 USDT (excluding futures trial bonuses) in your futures account and click on the Register Now button.

Notably, starting from 16:00:00 (UTC) on March 19, 2024, trading fees corresponding to participants' rewards in the "Trade to Earn" event will no longer be eligible for commissions or rebates. Other fees generated by their trades will remain unaffected. This initiative aims to further increase the daily buyback amount of $HTX to support stable $HTX appreciation.
