# Novo Resources sees substantial upside potential at Nunyerry

--News Direct--

Novo Resources Corp (ASX:NVO TSE:NVO) co-chair and acting CEO Mike Spreadborough joins Jonathan Jackson in the Proactive studio to discuss promising gold outcomes from recent reanalysis of drill intercepts in a 2023 program at Nunyerry North in Western Australia. Using advanced PhotonAssayâ„¢ technology, the company reassessed samples, revealing a significant grade increase, notably a 6-metre intercept at 6.12 g/t gold from 37 metres depth. This reanalysis, comparing 4-kilogram samples against the traditional 500 grams, highlighted the presence of coarse gold, prompting a strategic shift in assay methodology. Spreadborough underscores the "substantial upside potential" of Nunyerry North, with some high-grade results near the surface. He outlines the forthcoming phase two drill program, aimed at probing the extensions of the known gold-bearing horizon, structural targets and a possible mineralised porphyry intrusion. The acting CEO also speaks about plans to execute 4,000 metres of reverse circulation drilling along a 2-kilometre strike and the positive board changes Novo recently implemented. #ProactiveInvestors #NovoResources #ASX #TSE #Gold#invest #investing #investment #investor #stockmarket #stocks #stock #stockmarketnews
