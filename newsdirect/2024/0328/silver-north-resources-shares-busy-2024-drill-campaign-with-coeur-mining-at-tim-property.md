# Silver North Resources shares busy 2024 drill campaign with Coeur Mining at Tim Property

--News Direct--

Silver North Resources CEO Jason Weber joined Steve Darling from Proactive to unveil the 2024 drilling program at the Tim Property, which is under option to Coeur Mining, Inc. Coeur intends to commence exploration on the property in June, targeting silver-lead-zinc Carbonate Replacement Deposit (CRD) mineralization similar to that found at Coeurâ€™s Silvertip Mine Property, located 19 km to the south of Tim.

Coeur plans to initiate the 2024 program in June, focusing on drilling, geochemical sampling, and drill pad and access development, with crews operating out of the Silvertip Mine Camp. The program aims to complete approximately 2,000 meters of drilling from up to six drill pads, testing the potential for CRD-style mineralization along almost 2,000 meters of strike length of prospective stratigraphy.

Weber highlighted the strategic advantages of the Tim property, including road access, which is rare in Yukon exploration, thanks to its proximity to the access road to the Silvertip mine. This access, combined with the region's geological potential and previous findings, underscores the project's significance.

Moreover, Weber emphasized the exploration's potential to add value to Silver North Resources' portfolio and share price, independent of silver price fluctuations. The company aims to achieve discovery that enhances its overall value, demonstrating its commitment to advancing exploration efforts and unlocking the full potential of the Tim Property.
