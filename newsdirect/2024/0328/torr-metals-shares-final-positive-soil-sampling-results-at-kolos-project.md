# Torr Metals shares final positive soil sampling results at Kolos Project

--News Direct--

Torr Metals CEO Malcolm Dorsey joined Steve Darling from Proactive to share exciting updates regarding the company's Kolos Project. Torr Metals has unveiled the final assay results from its 2023 soil sampling program conducted on the Kolos Project, situated just 23 kilometers north-northeast of Merritt, British Columbia, along Highway 5.

Dorsey revealed to Proactive that the comprehensive analysis of a total of 3,348 soil samples, covering an expansive area of 48 square kilometers, has yielded promising results. The analysis has delineated five kilometer-scale mineralized zones within a potential cluster porphyry trend spanning 7 kilometers. Notably, each zone exhibits highly anomalous copper (Cu) concentrations, surpassing 200 parts per million (ppm) and reaching a maximum of 1175 ppm Cu.

Furthermore, Dorsey highlighted significant discoveries in the northern portion of the 2023 soil sampling grid. This includes the Rea Zone (Cu-Au), measuring 1200 meters by 350 meters, and the Clapperton Zone, spanning 1000 meters by 900 meters. Of particular interest is the presence of highly anomalous Cu-Mo mineralization associated with Late Triassic intrusions near large-scale intersecting north-south and northwest-southeast shear structures within the Clapperton Zone. This geological feature suggests a strong comparison to the nearby Highland Valley Cu-Mo porphyry deposit, located approximately 30 kilometers to the northwest.

The promising results from the soil sampling program underscore the potential of the Kolos Project as a significant mineral resource. Torr Metals is optimistic about the prospect of further exploration and development activities, leveraging these findings to advance its understanding of the project's geological characteristics and economic potential.

In summary, the latest assay results from the Kolos Project represent a significant milestone for Torr Metals, affirming the project's prospectivity and positioning the company for future success in the exploration and mining sector. With continued exploration efforts and strategic planning, Torr Metals is poised to unlock further value and deliver positive outcomes for its stakeholders.
