“Starting my career at the very foundation of Payop, I embraced every role with the eagerness to learn, contribute, and make a tangible difference. My initial position in Sales gave me a client-oriented approach, as our product's growth is intertwined with the success of our clients' businesses. Multiple partnerships with payment companies enriched my understanding of the industry, fostering innovations in online payments through collaboration. Ascending to the COO role allowed me to embed my personal values into our corporate culture, emphasizing client focus, innovation, diligence, and a commitment to continuous learning.

I am honoured to lead Payop and a talented Payop team into its next chapter.”
