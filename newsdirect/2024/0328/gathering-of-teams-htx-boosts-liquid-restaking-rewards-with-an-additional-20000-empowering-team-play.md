# Gathering of Teams! HTX Boosts Liquid Restaking Rewards with an Additional $20,000, Empowering Team Play

--News Direct--

HTX Liquid Restaking now boasts a $100 million staking quota after the launch of the last reward boost on March 25. The exchange's super event has emerged as a top choice for users seeking rewards from on-chain ecosystems and attracted wide enthusiastic participation.

In response to the wild engagement, the Liquid Restaking event launched the new feature of team participation, a catalyst fostering teamwork, competition, and the chance to seize greater rewards, and empowering users to leverage their influence. Engaging is as simple as creating your own team or joining an existing one.

According to HTX's official announcement, the exchange has decided to further boost the event's reward pool by adding $20,000 worth of $HTX specifically for team leaders. (Stay tuned for more incentives for teams and team leaders.) Currently, each team can have a maximum of 300 members.

As for the event details, it is reported that snapshots of the event leaderboard will be taken from March 25, 2024, at 09:00 (UTC) to April 24, 2024, at 16:00 (UTC). Rewards worth $20,000 in $HTX will be distributed within 7 working days after April 24, 2024, at 16:00 (UTC). Moreover, the rewards will be given to the leaders of top-ranked teams that hold the top 3 positions for the most days within 30 days by April 24, 2024. The rankings are based on the leaderboard's snapshots taken daily at random time during the event period. Specifically, teams will be ranked based on the team participating amount (the total assets of all members enabled for Liquid Restaking for the designated cryptocurrencies). The leaderboard can be viewed on the event page.
