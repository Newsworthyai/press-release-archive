--News Direct--

Since HTX launched the Spot "Trade to Earn" event, it has garnered broad user participation and received positive feedback. Amidst the escalating battle between bulls and bears in the crypto market, HTX has launched another Future "Trade to Earn" event. Similar to the previous "Trade to Earn" event, participants can once again vie for a share of the daily prize pool totaling 100,000 USDT by engaging in trading BTCUSDT Perpetual.

According to official sources, the 1st phase of HTX's Futures "Trade to Earn" event successfully concluded on March 27, with a 7-day cumulative trading volume exceeding 1 billion USDT and its trading depth returning to the Top 3. The trading volume has surged by 179% compared to before the event started. The platform has distributed rewards totaling over 300,000 USDT.

At present, HTX has launched the 2nd phase of Futures "Trade to Earn" event, lasting from 00:00:00 (UTC+8) on March 29, 2024, to 23:59:59 (UTC+8) on April 10, 2024. This event consists of 13 rounds, with each round spanning one day from 00:00:00 (UTC+8) on Day T to 23:59:59 (UTC+8) on the same day. Rewards will be credited to participants' HTX Spot accounts within 3 working days after the end of each round.

In this event, the applicable futures trading pair is BTCUSDT Perpetual (copy trading applies as well). Participants stand a chance to split a daily prize pool of $HTX worth 100,000 USDT. Rewards from the daily prize pool are distributed on a first-come, first-served basis.

It's worth noting that HTX has enhanced the reward ratio for its Futures "Trade to Earn" event. In the previous event, participants could earn a 105% reward ratio for Maker orders and a 102% reward ratio for Taker orders. However, in the second phase of the Futures "Trade to Earn" event, the reward ratio for Maker orders has been raised to 110%, while Taker orders now offer a 105% reward ratio, much higher than typical Earn products.

HTX's "Trade to Earn" event serves as an innovative model for cryptocurrency trading and empowerment, providing users with broader opportunities to engage in trading and earn profits. HTX will continue to improve the “Trade to Earn” model, optimize user experience, and enhance platform value. At the same time, it will actively explore more innovative business models to provide users with more diversified and efficient digital asset trading services.
