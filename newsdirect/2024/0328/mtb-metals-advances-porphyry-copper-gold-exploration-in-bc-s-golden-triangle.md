# MTB Metals Advances Porphyry Copper-Gold Exploration in BC's Golden Triangle

--News Direct--

MTB Metals CEO Lawrence Roulston joined Steve Darling from Proactive to share news about the company advances its exploration projects in the Golden Triangle of British Columbia, covering nearly 600 square kilometres across six distinct projects. The company's primary focus is on the Telegraph project, a porphyry copper-gold prospect located near four other world-class porphyries with identical geology.

Roulston told Proactive that during recent discussions at the PDAC conference and subsequent meetings, MTB Metals has attracted considerable interest from major mining companies for potential joint ventures or strategic investments, particularly in the Telegraph project. This interest stems from the project's promising location and the substantial exploration potential it holds. In 2021, MTB Metals consolidated a large property area and has conducted three field seasons of exploration.

Towards the end of the last season, four drill holes were completed across a 3.3-kilometre trend within the Telegraph project, indicating a large-scale porphyry system. While retail investors showed limited enthusiasm for the initial drilling results, major mining companies recognized the broader potential of the system, understanding that these initial holes only begin to reveal the project's capacity. Ralston plans to further explore the already drilled area and other porphyry centers within the 350-square-kilometre property, emphasizing the project's significant exploration and development potential.
