This partnership signifies AuKing Mining’s strategic move to extend its portfolio, which is focused on uranium and copper. BSMC, a subsidiary of the Segia Gulf Group, plays a pivotal role in this collaboration, bringing substantial local expertise and resources to the table. During the initial phase, AuKing, alongside BSMC, will focus on tapping into the vast mineral potential within the Kingdom, leveraging BSMC's operational strengths and insights.

While expanding into Saudi Arabia, AuKing continues to prioritise its copper and uranium projects in Tanzania and Australia. The company is gearing up to secure funding to advance these primary projects, balancing its growth strategy between exploring new territories and nurturing its existing assets.
