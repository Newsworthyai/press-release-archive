# ToolsGroup and Scarpe&Scarpe to Present at upcoming eP Summit, April 9-10, Florence, Italy

--News Direct--

ToolsGroup is excited to announce our participation in the upcoming eP Summit 2024, the Pitti Immagine event focused on the relationship between fashion and the digital world in Florence, Italy, on April 9-10. Additionally, we are thrilled to highlight the presence of one of our top retail customers in Italy, Scarpe&Scarpe, who will share their success story.

Marcello Pace, CEO of Scarpe&Scarpe, a major player in the retail of shoes and leather goods with over 100 stores across Italy, will discuss how the company is transforming its merchandising processes by integrating ToolsGroup’s AI-powered solutions. This revolutionary approach has enabled Scarpe&Scarpe to optimize margins while minimizing overstock, resulting in significant business improvements.

Pace first saw the value of the ToolsGroup solutions at the time when he was CEO of PittaRosso, another large Italian retailer of shoes, an experience which has eventually been published as a Harvard Business School case study. Facing the challenge of overstock and the need to enhance sell-through rates, PittaRosso implemented an automated markdown optimization solution leveraging historical sales data, comprehensive market insights, and inventory analytics. Within just two months of adopting ToolsGroup’s AI-driven solution, PittaRosso experienced a remarkable +14.3% increase in sell-through, alongside improved inventory efficiency, contributing to a €4.2 million boost in the overall margin. Pace’s success in generating growth for PittaRosso through revolutionary AI was the foundation for his vision towards achieving a similarly transformative impact at Scarpe&Scarpe.

Marcello Pace commented, “We urgently needed a strategy to maximize margin and sell-through rates. Within just months, ToolsGroup’s AI-powered solution provided tangible results, perfectly aligning with our inventory and growth objectives. Embracing digital transformation is crucial for our brand’s retail expansion, and ToolsGroup emerged as the ideal technological partner to enhance our revenue and margin growth.”

Inna Kuznetsova, CEO of ToolsGroup, emphasized, ““Scarpe&Scarpe's success embodies today’s AI powered revolution in retail and supply chain planning technologies. The immediate business impact they observed is a testament to how real-time decision making not only adapts to an unpredictable market, but enables businesses to thrive in it. It's a privilege to partner with Scarpe&Scarpe on their innovation and digital transformation journey. Together, we're paving the way for smarter, more sustainable growth.”
