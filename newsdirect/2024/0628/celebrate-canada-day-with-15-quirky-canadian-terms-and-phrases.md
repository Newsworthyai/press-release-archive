These expressions not only reflect the nation's cultural diversity but also provide a charming insight into everyday life in the Great White North.

1.	Timmies

“Timmies” is short for Tim Hortons, which is a part of Canadian life and is well known for its coffee and donuts.

Example: "Let's meet at Timmies for breakfast."

2.	Keener

In Canada, "keener" is a slang term used to describe someone who is very enthusiastic. It's commonly used in academic settings where students refer to those who try to impress teachers. Despite its playful connotation, the term is believed to have originated in the 1970s.

Example: "During the group project, Sarah quickly emerged as the keener, always staying late to perfect our presentation and impress the professor."

3.	Toque (pronounced "toohk")

When winter arrives in Canada, you’ll hear the term "toque" quite often. This knitted winter hat, known elsewhere as a beanie or wool cap, is essential for braving the Canadian cold.

Example: "Don't forget your toque; it's cold outside!"

4.	Loonie and Toonie

Canada's unique one-dollar and two-dollar coins are called the "loonie" and "toonie." The one-dollar coin is named after the loon bird featured on it, while the two-dollar coin, which is bimetallic, humorously extends the naming convention from the loonie.

Example sentence: "I need a loonie for the parking meter."

5.	Double-double

A trip to Tim Hortons, the beloved Canadian coffee chain, wouldn't be complete without ordering a "double-double." This term refers to a coffee with two creams and two sugars.

Example: "I'll grab a double-double from Timmies."

6.	Kerfuffle

This delightful term refers to a commotion or fuss, often used to describe minor disputes or disruptions.

Example: "There was a bit of a kerfuffle at the hockey game last night."

7.	Molson muscle

A humorous term for a beer belly, "Molson muscle" is named after Molson, one of Canada’s most popular beer brands.

Example: "After years of drinking beer, he's developed quite the Molson muscle."

A "two-four" is a case of 24 beers, an essential item for many long weekends and parties in Canada.

Example: "Let's pick up a two-four for the party."

9.	Chesterfield

While in other parts of the world you might sit on a sofa or a couch, in Canada, you might find yourself relaxing on a "chesterfield."

Example: "Come sit on the chesterfield and relax."

10.	Hoser

Popularized by the comedic duo Bob and Doug McKenzie, a "hoser" is a playful or humorous insult, often used to describe someone a bit silly or unsophisticated.

Example: "Stop being such a hoser and help out."

11.	Eh

Perhaps the most stereotypical Canadian expression, "eh" is a versatile interjection used to solicit agreement or confirm understanding, often at the end of a sentence.

Example: "It's a nice day, eh?"

12.	Runners

Canadians call their athletic shoes "runners," a term that might confuse those accustomed to "sneakers" or "trainers."

Example: "I need to buy a new pair of runners for the gym."

13.	Kerfuffle

Kerfuffle is an amusing word to pronounce, but it describes an unpleasant situation. It refers to getting into a minor scuffle, quarrel, or commotion—just short of an all-out fight.

Example: "There was quite a kerfuffle in the office when the printer stopped working right before the big presentation."

14.	Bunny hug

Bunny Hug is a term unique to the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, referring to a sweater or hoodie. Those on the eastern side of Canada might find this slang unfamiliar.

Example sentence: "When the weather turned chilly, I grabbed my favorite bunny hug to stay warm."

15.	"T Dot" and "The 6ix"

These are popular nicknames for Toronto, widely recognized due to rapper Drake. However, locals used these terms well before they gained mainstream popularity. "The 6ix" refers to the six boroughs of the Greater Toronto Area and the city's area codes, 416 and 647.

Example sentence: "Many people refer to Toronto as The 6ix, a nod to its six boroughs and area codes."
