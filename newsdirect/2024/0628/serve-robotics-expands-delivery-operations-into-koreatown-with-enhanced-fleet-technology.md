# Serve Robotics Expands Delivery Operations into Koreatown with Enhanced Fleet Technology

Serve Robotics CEO Dr. Ali Kashani joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce the expansion of the company's delivery operations into Koreatown. This move is part of Serve's long-term plan to broaden its geographic reach in Los Angeles and across the U.S. Koreatown was selected for its dense and vibrant commercial hub, growing residential community, and well-maintained sidewalk infrastructure, which are ideal for robotic delivery. This coverage expansion follows ongoing collaboration with the Los Angeles city government and local stakeholders.

In preparation for scaling up its fleet for future expansions, Serve has announced the signing of an expanded supply agreement with Ouster, Inc. This agreement will equip Serve's next-generation robots with the latest-generation lidar sensors, providing equipment for 2,000 robots. Lidar technology is critical to Serve's autonomy stack, enabling the robots to perceive their environment, identify their precise location, and safely navigate alongside pedestrians and other sidewalk users. Serve anticipates that the new sensors will improve the safety, speed, and cost-effectiveness of its fleet.

This strategic expansion and technological enhancement highlight Serve Robotics' commitment to advancing its autonomous delivery services and meeting the growing demand for efficient, sustainable delivery solutions.
