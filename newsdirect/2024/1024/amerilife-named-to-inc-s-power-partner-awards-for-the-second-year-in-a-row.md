# AmeriLife Named to Inc.’s Power Partner Awards for the Second Year in a Row

In acknowledgment of consistent excellence, Inc. Business Media has once again recognized AmeriLife Group, LLC (“AmeriLife”), a national leader in developing, marketing, and distributing life and health insurance, annuities, and retirement planning solutions, in its third annual Power Partner Awards, which honor business-to-business (B2B) organizations across the globe that have a proven track record of supporting entrepreneurs and helping startups grow.

AmeriLife claimed top honors in the Insurance and Financial Services categories, propelled by glowing endorsements from its Health and Wealth Distribution organizations. The company joined an elite group of nearly 400 global B2B organizations, all celebrated for their exceptional support to entrepreneurs and partner institutions in critical areas such as hiring, compliance, and infrastructure development. Through AmeriLife’s partnership program, company founders and leaders can shift focus and resources toward their core business objectives.

“Being recognized by Inc. as a Power Partner in the health and life insurance distribution industry is a tremendous honor for AmeriLife,” said Scotty Elliott, Chief Distribution Officer of Health for AmeriLife. “This award is a powerful testament to our dedication to excellence, innovation, and providing unparalleled value to our affiliate partners. We're honored to be recognized as a trusted ally in helping companies flourish and achieve their goals in today's competitive landscape.”

"This accolade is a true reflection of our steadfast dedication to superior performance, forward-thinking strategies, and providing unmatched service through our wealth distribution platform,” said Mike Vietri, Chief Distribution Officer of Wealth for AmeriLife. “We're thrilled to be distinguished for our work in financial services and our role in helping businesses and individuals prosper."

Targeted expansion aligned with a holistic strategy

Since 2020, AmeriLife has welcomed nearly 90 affiliates to its family of companies, culminating in establishing distinct Health and Wealth Distribution channels in January 2023. This restructuring and ongoing investments in world-class resources enable a comprehensive approach to retirement planning. Notable additions include the proprietary leads platform, LeadStar, the insights platform, Atlas, and strategic expansion within the Wealth space to include RIA and Broker-Dealer capabilities. These initiatives work together to fulfill life and health insurance needs and the premier financial services and retirement planning solutions to deliver a truly holistic approach.

“This is our definitive listing of vendors and suppliers who have demonstrated excellence in serving small- and midsize customers,” says Inc. editor-in-chief Mike Hofman. “As part of the vetting process, our team of editors, researchers, and reporters gathered information on companies’ products and services, assessed their reputation as captured in online comments and forums, and collected customer testimonials to ensure that the sales pitch matches the client experience. In every case, we spoke to founders like you who were happy to attest to a vendor’s genuine commitment to a mutually beneficial business partnership. We’re happy to be the conduit for that positive word of mouth.”
