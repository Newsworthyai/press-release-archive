# Wise Food Storage Expands Accessibility with Addition to Military Discount Sites

Wise Food Storage is excited to announce its official inclusion on several military discount sites, including Military.com. This expansion is part of Wise's ongoing commitment to making emergency preparedness accessible to more households, particularly those of the brave men and women who protect our freedom.

As America's favorite survival food provider, Wise Food Storage has long been a steadfast supporter of the military and first responders. As an All-American company, it is essential to give back to the veterans and military community who have fought to secure our freedom.

Norm Ramos, Spokesperson for Wise Food Storage, stated, "Having veterans within our own company has been instrumental in understanding their life experiences, and we greatly appreciate their dedication and service. We are proud to offer this discount as a token of our gratitude for their contributions to our country."

To show our appreciation, Wise Food Storage is offering a special 10% discount sitewide, even on sale items, to all military members, veterans, and dependents. As 2024 brings a year of uncertainty, now is the time to get prepared. Wise is committed to helping individuals and families enhance their readiness in these unpredictable times.

"We hope a lot of military and veteran households will be able to take advantage of these offers and shop some of our best prices on preparedness products," Ramos added. "Don't waitâ€”now is the time to stock up."

In addition to these discounts, Wise Food Storage is proud of partnerships that give back, including our partnership with Randy Couture and his non-profit, Xtreme Couture GI Foundation. After his own military service, Randy created his non-profit to help raise money and awareness to assist our nation's combat veterans and their families struggling with financial burdens as they return to civilian life. Through the Prepare with Randy signature edition bucket line, 20% of each purchase is donated to this non-profit.
