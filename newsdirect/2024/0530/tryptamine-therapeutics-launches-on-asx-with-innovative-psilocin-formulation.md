# Tryptamine Therapeutics launches on ASX with innovative psilocin formulation

Tryptamine Therapeutics Inc. (ASX: TYP) CEO Jason Carroll sits down with Jonathan Jackson in the proactive studio to talk about the start of trading on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Tryptamine, a clinical-stage biotechnology company, is focused on developing an intravenous-infused psilocin formulation for psychedelic-assisted therapy. The companyâ€™s core programs include TRP-8803 (IV-infused psilocin formulation) and TRP-8802 (oral psilocybin). TRP-8803 aims to address the limitations of oral psilocybin, offering a faster onset of the psychedelic state, precise control of the experience, and a shorter duration, making it commercially viable. Three open-label trials in the United States using TRP-8802 for fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and binge eating disorder (BED) are underway or recently completed. In a BED study at the University of Florida, TRP-8802 showed over 80% reduction in binge eating episodes and decreased anxiety and depression scores. Tryptamine Therapeutics is supported by a qualified Board, a Scientific Advisory Board, and partnerships with research organisations in the US and Australia. A world-first clinical trial of TRP-8803 will commence in Australia this quarter, with more trials planned for 2024 and 2025.
