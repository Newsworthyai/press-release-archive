# Department of the Army Debuts First Campaign Highlighting Army Civilian Careers

A video accompanying this announcement is available at: https://youtu.be/FMkGY43U8FQ

For the first time, the Department of the Army debuted a campaign focused on Army Civilian Careers.

“Find Your Next Level” demonstrates how private citizens can bring their existing skills and abilities to an Army Civilian Career and have an impact that can only be found in the Department of the Army.

Individuals looking for a new challenge in their career can choose from more than 500 career paths. Army Civilians work across industries with roles in finance, cybersecurity, engineering, and beyond.

With more than 265,000 employees, the Army Civilian workforce is one of the largest groups of Civilian employees within the Department of Defense. The Civilian role in the Army dates back to the founding of our country in 1776, and Army Civilians continue to play a critical role in the Army’s success today.

Because there is low public awareness that the Department of the Army employs Civilians, the campaign aims to bridge this gap by demonstrating how professionals can bring their existing skills and abilities to an Army Civilian Career.

On May 22nd, a media tour was conducted with Army Civilian, Dr. John E. Deaton. He shared his unique perspective on the campaign as a former Army Ranger who ultimately returned to the Army as a Civilian later in his career – this time in veterinary sciences.

His experience as an Army Ranger brought him the critical skills of discipline and leadership that would serve as the foundation for a fulfilling career in veterinary medicine after his service in uniform. Today he serves as the Deputy Director of Veterinary Sciences at Joint Base San Antonio where he leverages insights from his veterinary expertise to train the next generation of Soldiers.

Topics that Dr. Deaton discussed included:

· Why the Army is launching a campaign focused on Civilians.

· His journey to the Army and why he chose to return as a Civilian.

· What opportunities his Civilian career in the Army has provided.

· Types of Army Civilian Career paths are available.
