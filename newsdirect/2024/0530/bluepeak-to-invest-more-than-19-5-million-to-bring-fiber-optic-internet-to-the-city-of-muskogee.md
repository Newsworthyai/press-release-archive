# Bluepeak to Invest More Than $19.5 Million to Bring Fiber Optic Internet 
to the City of Muskogee

Bluepeak is investing more than $19.5 million to expand its fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) network to the City of Muskogee, Oklahoma. The network expansion will bring a new fast, affordable, reliable fiber broadband option to more than 16,000 homes and businesses in Muskogee starting in 2024.

Previously announced in 2022, Muskogee is one of several new expansion markets for Bluepeak slated for launch in 2024 and 2025, and has actively moved into the design and engineering phase.

“This marks a significant milestone for Muskogee. Cutting-edge fiber technology to our homes and businesses ensures that Muskogee stays ahead in the digital landscape,” said Planning and Community Development Director, Jody King. “We are excited that Bluepeak has been submitting permits for their planned build and are ready to support this project and the many benefits it will bring to our community.”

“We are thrilled that Bluepeak’s investment in Muskogee’s broadband infrastructure is progressing, with the completion of their permitting process and imminent construction,” said Avery Frix, Senator-elect. “This initiative not only provides our community with choices for connectivity but also supports economic development, education, and overall quality of life. We look forward to seeing the positive impact this will have.”

Since 2021, Bluepeak has been dramatically improving broadband options by bringing fast, reliable, affordable fiber internet to residents of Oklahoma, Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, and soon, Texas. The latest network expansion investment is part of Bluepeak’s larger plans to invest more than $200 million to continue building out its network in its currently served markets, reaching more than 200,000 new locations with its fiber network in 2024 and 2025.

With Bluepeak service, customers get fiber-fast speeds, equal upload and download speeds and whole-home WiFi. Bluepeak service features all-in pricing, where the price on the website is the price on the bill, with a minimum service tier of 1 gigabit-per-second (Gbps). Homes can get up to 5 Gbps and businesses 10 Gbps and beyond. Each fiber internet speed package includes Wi-Fi powered by eero, along with the added value of eero Secure, which protects devices from online threats, ads and allows for customized content filtering. Bluepeak's fiber network provides reliable connectivity and the bandwidth to connect more devices for internet, streaming, gaming and more.

Ultimately, Bluepeak service increases broadband competition for internet consumers by providing a fast, reliable, affordable choice for internet in communities where options have traditionally been very limited.

* According to the Federal Trade Commission, competition “benefits consumers by keeping prices low and the quality and choice of goods and services high.”
* In addition, a 2020 report by Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond on “Bringing Broadband to Rural America” determined that broadband access and adoption is linked to increased job and population growth, higher rates of new business formation, higher home values, and lower unemployment rates.
