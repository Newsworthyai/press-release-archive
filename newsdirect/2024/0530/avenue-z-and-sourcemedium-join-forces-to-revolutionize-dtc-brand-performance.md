# Avenue Z and SourceMedium Join Forces to Revolutionize DTC Brand Performance

Avenue Z, a leader in performance marketing and social commerce for direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands, has partnered with SourceMedium to introduce their new Convergence Dashboard and Data Analytics Solution. This innovative collaboration merges SourceMedium's advanced data infrastructure with Avenue Z's expertise in data visualization and strategy, redefining holistic, data-driven decision-making. Avenue Z’s new dashboard platform allows you to see performance from all marketing channels, down to specific ads by the hour, with customizable views for faster insights into trend analysis, creative performance, customer lifetime value (LTV), profitability, and contribution margin, website performance, merchandising, and more.

As consumer behavior shifts and the market evolves, DTC brands confront challenges in optimizing marketing strategies. Avenue Z excels in driving profitable growth for DTC brands through performance media, digital marketing, PR, and strategic communications. With this collaboration, Avenue Z will leverage SourceMedium's proprietary data & technological infrastructure to optimize a brand's performance across the entire ecosystem, from The Wall Street Journal to Shopify and TikTok.

“The DTC reporting landscape has often been fragmented, with brands grappling to piece together a coherent narrative from myriad data points. Our collaboration with Avenue Z aims to change this narrative. By merging our advanced data infrastructure with their adeptness in data visualization and interpretation, we’re setting a new gold standard in DTC analytics. It’s about connecting the dots in ways that were previously unimaginable,” said Fei Wang, Founder of SourceMedium.

SourceMedium, a DTC data management, and AI infrastructure leader, equips brands with tools for digital success. Their robust infrastructure integrates seamlessly, ensuring efficiency and scalability in media buying. In building the Convergence Dashboard, a proprietary analytics dashboard with unmatched flexibility, Avenue Z is enhancing its capabilities to deliver even better client results. DTC brands that are clients of Avenue Z will now gain exclusive access to this proprietary tool and expert network.

“We are excited to partner with SourceMedium to develop proprietary omni-channel analytics dashboards that leverage source-of-truth cohort data,” said Jonathan Snow, Author of the DTC and digital trends newsletter In The Snow, President and Founder of The Snow Agency, and Chief Innovation Officer at Avenue Z.

The collaboration between Avenue Z and SourceMedium aims to create a third-party partnership focused on delivering unparalleled data-driven insights and strategies to its clients.

“This collaboration aligns perfectly with our mission of driving profitable growth for DTC brands through the utilization of the most advanced tools and tactics available. In an ever-evolving market that emphasizes the efficiency of media dollars, we will now be able to provide our clients with an integrated, modeled data set that paints a clear picture of their entire digital ecosystem,” said Snow.

Avenue Z and SourceMedium are working on integrating an additional technology partner to inject AI-driven predictive forecasting and a recommendation engine into the proprietary tool. This modernized approach to performance marketing is long-awaited and will level up the meaning of “data-driven” for the entire DTC industry.

“The term ‘data-driven’ has been used and sometimes overused in the DTC space. However, with this partnership, we’re elevating its meaning. Being data-driven is no longer just about having access to numbers; it’s about understanding those numbers, predicting trends, and making informed decisions. By integrating AI-driven forecasting and recommendation engines, we’re pushing the boundaries of what it means to be truly data-driven, ensuring DTC brands not only stay ahead of the curve but redefine it,” Wang said.

As the DTC market continues to evolve, Avenue Z introduces Convergence Analytics, a Data Analytics solution that transforms cross-channel reporting through customized data modeling. This innovation equips marketing teams with advanced tools for detailed insights into customer journeys, enhancing decision-making and strategic control.

"Convergence Analytics, Avenue Z’s new Data Analytics solution, is revolutionizing cross-channel reporting by offering customized data modeling that delivers unparalleled accuracy for DTC media and marketing teams. We built this solution because our clients demanded better revenue attribution than what is typically available. By leveraging our platform, we can attribute clicks beyond standard tools like Meta, activating data that helps pinpoint the visits that yield more sales," said David Corchado, Chief Strategy & Technology Officer at Avenue Z. "This solution not only removes the guesswork from the path to conversion but also equips teams with control through focused dashboards, providing deep insights into the entire customer journey."

Demos of the Data Analytics solution and Convergence Dashboard are available now at AvenueZ.com.
