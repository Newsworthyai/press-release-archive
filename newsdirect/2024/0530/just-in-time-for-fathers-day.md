Sunpower Renewables Pty. Ltd., just launching in the United States, just in time for Father’s Day. This Australian renewable energy solutions company has developed modern, efficient, and smart solar energy products that allow customers to achieve energy independence while being cost effective, long lasting, and environmentally friendly. These ‘Australian Made’ products, with cutting-edge technology, are designed for industrial, commercial, residential, and off-grid applications.

“We are so excited to have our solar powered generators available in the United States, these items are created to empower every consumer to generate, store and use solar energy anytime, anywhere,” said Rahul Kale, founder of Sunpower Renewables. “These state-of-the-art, simple-to-use, and light-weight portable solutions have proven to be more sustainable & viable, both commercially and technically, than traditional solar and renewable alternatives.”

SR Portables renewable energy generation and storage devices, ranging from hand-held to grid connected products, allow users to generate and store energy (from the grid, solar or external generators) and then intelligently release it to appliances based on user-programmed preferences to reduce the total electricity costs for the user.

“From camping and powering homes to defense and humanitarian aid, these solar powered generators are your one-stop-shop for replacing portable diesel generators and home inverters,” said Kale.
