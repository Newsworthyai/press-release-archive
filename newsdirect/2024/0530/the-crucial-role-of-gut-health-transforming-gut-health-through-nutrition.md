# The Crucial Role of Gut Health
Transforming Gut Health through Nutrition

Is your diet supporting your gut health effectively? Recently, Registered Dietician and MyFitnessPal Scientific Advisory Council member, Maya Feller, conducted a satellite media tour to explain better eating habits that support gut health to enhance your focus, energy, mood, sleep, and weight.

A video accompanying this announcement is available at: https://youtu.be/rjznUQsEet0

According to a recent MyFitnessPal survey1 86% of people say they’re aware of the importance of maintaining gut health and 43% actively seek out gut health-related information. However, only 18% consider themselves to be “very” knowledgeable about what contributes to gut health.

In response, the no. 1 global nutrition and food tracking app, MyFitnessPal collaborated with MyFitnessPal Scientific Advisory Council Member Dr. Janese Laster, to create the Gut Health Nutrition Plan, available now to all members for free in the MyFitnessPal app.

Those who opt into the week-long plan will have access to nutrition ideas and suggestions, quizzes that test knowledge and assess current eating habits, and daily check-ins that encourage reflection on progress and current knowledge to help enable behavior change and fuel motivations.

MyFitnessPal’s survey found that despite 85% of people trying to incorporate a variety of fruits and vegetables into their diet to improve gut health, only 2% are consuming more than 20 fruits and vegetables each week.

To bring even more awareness to a person’s food intake, MyFitnessPal introduced a free feature, Food Group Insights, which gives members an overview of the number of foods they logged in a week categorized by food groups. And for those wondering how to get gut-healthy foods on their plate, MyFitnessPal introduced a new gut health recipe collection featuring high-fiber recipes that include a variety of fruits and vegetables.
