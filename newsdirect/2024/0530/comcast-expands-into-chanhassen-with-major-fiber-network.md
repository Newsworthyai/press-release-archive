# Comcast Expands into Chanhassen with Major Fiber Network

Comcast announced today it will continue to significantly expand its next-generation Xfinity network into Chanhassen, Minnesota. The media and technology company will invest millions to install new fiber-rich highways that will provide multi-gig speeds and unmatched reliability to more than 10,500 homes and businesses with a planned completion by the end of 2025. The Chanhassen expansion adds to Comcast’s more than $525 million technology and infrastructure investments across Minnesota over the last three years.

Comcast’s planned expansion follows February’s announcement of expanding its smart, fast, reliable fiber-rich network to seven cities in Minnesota, including Cologne and Nowthen, and parts of Corcoran, Grant, Hugo, Rogers and Stillwater Township by the end of 2024. In June 2023, Comcast completed an expansion to more than 2,300 homes and businesses in the City of Wayzata, where area businesses now enjoy Comcast Business’s suite of products, including broadband speeds of up to 100 Gbps, and Xfinity products for residents with Internet speeds faster than a gig over standard connections in the home.

“We are pleased to welcome Comcast to our community. Access to high-quality cable and internet services is essential for our residents and businesses, and having more options ensures that everyone can find a plan that best meets their needs. We look forward to the benefits that increased competition and improved infrastructure will bring," said Chanhassen Mayor Elise Ryan.

Residential customers will be able to take advantage of Xfinity’s full suite of products, including Internet, video, mobile, voice and managed home solutions. For local businesses, Comcast Business will offer a suite of connectivity, communications, networking, cybersecurity, wireless, and managed solutions to help organizations of different sizes prepare for what’s next. Comcast Business has been consistently recognized by industry analysts and associations as a leader and innovator, and one of the fastest-growing providers of Ethernet services.

“Reliable high-speed Internet is essential in today’s digital economy, which is why Comcast continues its commitment to connect more Twin Cities families and businesses to the moments that matter most,” said Kalyn Hove, Comcast Midwest Regional Senior Vice President. “We are expanding our fiber highways in Chanhassen, strategically investing in areas undergoing significant growth. By establishing the best broadband infrastructure today, we are securing the economic prosperity of these communities for tomorrow.”

Comcast’s commitment to new communities goes beyond the build—addressing digital opportunities in communities through Project UP, the company’s $1 billion commitment to help tens of millions of people connect to the Internet and build futures of unlimited possibilities.

Over the past three years, Comcast has invested more than $5 million in cash and in kind donations in the Twin Cities to help shrink the digital divide. The focus includes helping people build digital skills in the workforce, expanding WiFi connected Lift Zones and funding connectivity and internet adoption programs. The funding also supports ongoing efforts to build awareness about affordable connectivity services like Internet Essentials, which offers eligible households high-speed internet for $9.95/month or Internet Essentials Plus for $29.95/month. Affordable computers are also available through Internet Essentials. Since its inception in 2011, the program has connected more than 480,000 students, parents, veterans and seniors in Minnesota.
