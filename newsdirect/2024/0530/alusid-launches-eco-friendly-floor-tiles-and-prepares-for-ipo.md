# Alusid Launches Eco-Friendly Floor Tiles and Prepares for IPO

Alusid CEO Alasdair Bremner joined Steve Darling from Proactive to share exciting news about the company's latest developments. Alusid has launched its first range of floor tiles through Parkside Architectural Tiles, the commercial arm of Topps Tiles Plc. This new range, called Mas, is made from 95% to 98.5% recycled content, depending on the color, and boasts one of the lowest carbon footprints of tiles on the market. This eco-friendly feature is particularly significant for the construction industry and its customers, who are increasingly facing carbon taxes, tougher environmental regulations, and stringent sustainability targets. Topps Tiles is expected to introduce the Mas range to retail customers later this year.

Bremner highlighted that floor tiles account for approximately 60% of the total tile market. The Mas tiles have undergone extensive testing, proving to be hardwearing with porcelain-grade breaking strength. They are mass-manufactured using industry-standard equipment, with production being subcontracted to ensure high quality and efficiency.

In addition to product development, Alusid has successfully raised £1.13 million from new and existing investors in January 2024. This capital injection supports the company's growth initiatives, including plans for an initial public offering (IPO) later this year. The IPO is expected to provide Alusid with the financial flexibility to expand its operations and market presence.

Alusid's innovative approach and commitment to sustainability have already attracted notable customers, including Starbucks EMEA, H&M, Pret a Manger, and the BBC. The company is also in discussions with potential distributors in Northern Europe to further expand into new territories.

Bremner expressed confidence in Alusid’s strategic direction, emphasizing the company’s dedication to producing sustainable building materials that meet the highest standards of quality and environmental responsibility. The launch of the Mas tile range represents a significant step forward in this mission, offering an eco-friendly solution for the construction industry.

In conclusion, Alusid’s launch of its eco-friendly floor tiles, successful fundraising, and upcoming IPO plans mark a period of rapid growth and development for the company. With strong market demand for sustainable products and a robust expansion strategy, Alusid is well-positioned to make a substantial impact in the building materials industry and contribute to a greener future.
