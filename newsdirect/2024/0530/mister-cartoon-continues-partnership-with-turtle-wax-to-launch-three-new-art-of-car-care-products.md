Designed to elevate the aesthetic of your ride while also leaving it properly protected, these innovations expand upon the seven detailing products the duo launched in 2023, along with numerous air care products. The innovations include:

All Metal Polish (SRP $13): This is not your average metal polish; it's a comprehensive solution for all your metal polishing needs, designed to bring out the best in your vehicle's metal surfaces.

· Its powerful formula contains precision polishing agents that brighten metal surfaces and fight off future oxidation.

· Specifically designed to restore the original reflection in chrome, aluminum, brass, stainless steel, and more, it will help to ensure your vehicle's metal parts stay as good as new – no matter what you drive.

· Added ceramic infusion helps clean, restore, polish, and protect all metal surfaces, making it a must-have for long-term metal care.

Quick Wax (SRP $12): Achieving the perfect, glossy shine for your ride is now a breeze, and it will remain fully protected, too.

· Ceramic infusion provides notable shine to your finish, as well as protection and exceptional water repellency in minutes.

· The powers of synthetic sealants and carnauba wax combine to create a stunning, mirror-like shine on all exterior surfaces.

· The application is quick and easy. Simply spray on a clean, wet, or dry vehicle and wipe it off to reveal the gloss shine.

· It's a hassle-free way to keep your vehicle looking its best, allowing you to focus on enjoying your ride!

Tire Coat (SRP $14): Thanks to ceramic and acrylic infusion, your tires will experience unmatched, lasting brilliance and protection for up to a year, giving you peace of mind that your car's appearance is maintained for an extended period.

· Tire Coat provides a deep black, high-gloss, layer-able shine, bringing water and dirt repellency while driving.

· Scrub resistance means you can take your car wherever you want, even wash it, without worrying about removing the coating.

· It dries to the touch in minutes and won't accumulate dirt, and you can hit the road without worrying about slinging.
