Disemminated on behalf of Gladiator Metals Corp.

Gladiator Metals Corp. (TSX-V:GLAD) (OTCQB:GDTRF) is a mineral exploration company focused on advancing high-grade copper projects. With a strategic emphasis on the Whitehorse Copper Belt in Yukon, Canada, Gladiator is committed to uncovering and developing significant copper resources. The company's exploration efforts have already identified promising copper skarn mineralization at Cowley Park and the newly staked Jackson Copper Skarn prospect.

Gladiator’s team leverages historical data and modern exploration techniques to expand their resource base, aiming to create substantial value for shareholders through the discovery and development of high-grade copper assets.

Gladiator Metals Corp. (TSX-V:GLAD) (OTCQB:GDTRF) has recently expanded its Whitehorse Copper Project by staking 55 new claims, adding 11.3 km² of tenure to encompass the Jackson Copper-Skarn prospect. This new prospect lies 15 km west of the existing claims and covers over 6 km of prospective strike between Cretaceous intrusive bodies and Triassic metasediments, which is a key control on mineralization in the Whitehorse Copper Belt.

Historical exploration at the Jackson Copper-Skarn prospect has revealed significant potential. Shallow drill results have intersected high-grade copper skarns with notable intersections including 6.12m at 5.61% Cu, 1.03 g/t Au, and 247 g/t Ag from 55.14m, 10.67m at 6.45 g/t Au from 71.02m within 21.88m at 3.45 g/t Au, and 1.99m at 4.0 g/t Au from 19.35m).

Undrilled target areas with high-grade copper skarn mineralization have also been identified on the surface. These include the Franklin Target with rock chip samples showing up to 9.4% copper (Cu), 6.36 g/t gold and 30% Cu, the Hamilton Target with samples revealing up to 3.48% Cu (10.4% zinc) and 1.69% Cu (42.9% Zn), and the Janet Target with samples indicating up to 7.85% Cu and 16.59 g/t gold associated with magnetite skarns and elevated Fe values.

Initial airborne magnetics conducted by previous explorers have highlighted undrilled high-magnetic anomalies over more than 4.4 km of strike, indicating further exploration potential. Gladiator Metals Corp. (TSX-V:GLAD) (OTCQB:GDTRF) has begun its summer exploration program, which includes mapping and sampling, with drone magnetics planned for later in the season.

The Jackson Prospect has been intermittently explored by historical explorers through spatially constrained soil sampling, mapping, trenching, and approximately 1,901m of diamond drilling across 24 drill holes. This historical work, supported by limited airborne magnetics conducted in 2014 by Precision Geophysics, highlighted over 4.4 km of untested magnetic anomalism coinciding with high magnetic response areas, outcropping magnetite-copper skarns, and the mapped contact between Cretaceous intrusions and Triassic limestones.

Outside the drilled area, further undrilled and underexplored mineralized targets remain. These are highlighted by high-grade copper skarn mineralization exposed on the surface for over 6 km and include the Franklin Target, the Hamilton Target, and the Janet Target.

With the start of summer exploration programs, Gladiator Metals is looking forward to updating the market with further news from the Whitehorse Copper Belt in the coming weeks.

Gladiator Metals Announces Significant High-Grade Copper Assay Results from Cowley ParkOn May 28, Gladiator Metals Corp. (TSX-V:GLAD) (OTCQB:GDTRF) announced assay results for additional historic drill holes at Cowley Park, further defining the high-grade copper skarn mineralization. Key results include 10.3m at 1.92% Cu and 1459 ppm or .15% Mo from 131.7m, 10m at 1.07% Cu from 49m (within 24m at 0.63% Cu from 35m), and 8m at 1.02% Cu from 105m.

The results highlight areas for significant exploration upside. The southeastern extension has a potential extension of over 100m to the east. The northeastern extension shows 43.28m @ 2.24% Cu from 93.27m, remaining open to the east. Initial drilling indicates unexplored sub-parallel trends. A significant fault may have displaced the main mineralized body, suggesting potential westward extension. Mineralization remains open at depth, with significant intervals reported.

CEO Jason Bontempo emphasized the importance of these findings, noting that they define the continuity and scale of high-grade copper mineralization at Cowley Park and identify new exploration targets for future programs.
