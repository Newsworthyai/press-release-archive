# Hibbett and Nike announce Duncanville High School boys & girls basketball as second recipient of new philanthropic initiative, First String

Hibbett, in partnership with Nike, celebrated the launch of The Origin with Duncanville High School alum and point guard for the Orlando Magic, Anthony Black, with a $50,000 donation to Duncanville High School boys and girls basketball programs as part of their new philanthropic initiative, First String.

“We couldn’t think of a more fitting way to commemorate the launch of The Origin with Anthony Black than by naming Duncanville as a First String recipient,” said Sarah Wangaard, Hibbett Vice President of Marketing. “Anthony’s journey to the NBA has deep roots here and this program is designed to make a lasting impact for these student-athletes, on and off the court.”

Hibbett and Nike gathered with the Duncanville High School boys and girls basketball team members yesterday in Texas to unveil Anthony Black’s inaugural episode of The Origin. Produced in partnership with Nice Kicks and Nike, The Origin is an original mini-series exploring the stories behind emerging talent in sports and culture, highlighting the drive, resilience, and support systems that fuel their journeys. In the episode, Anthony Black details his journey from high school basketball standout to NBA top 10 draft pick.

In addition to screening The Origin episode and each of the players being rewarded with a new pair of the Lebron Witness 8 in team colors, the moment was commemorated by a personal message from Anthony Black to the boys and girls teams naming Duncanville High School as a First String recipient. The boys and girls basketball programs received a donation of $50,000 as part of the program and one student from each of the teams will be granted with scholarship funding for four years and Hibbett internship opportunities in their corporate headquarters in Birmingham, Alabama.

“We are incredibly grateful to Hibbett, Nike, and Anthony Black for this generous and impactful donation to our boys and girls basketball programs,” said the Duncanville ISD Superintendent, Dr. T. Lamar Goree. “This partnership is a testament to the power of community support and the importance of investing in our student-athletes. The $50,000 donation and the scholarships and internship opportunities provided through the First String initiative will have a lasting impact on our students—both on the court and in their futures. Anthony’s journey from Duncanville to the NBA is an inspiration, and we are honored to have our school celebrated as a First String recipient. Together, we are creating opportunities for our students to dream big and reach their fullest potential.”

“We’re excited to name Duncanville as our second recipient of First String,” said Robby Bullington, Hibbett Vice President of Stores. “We just launched this program earlier this year and we look forward to seeing the impact First String will have on high school student-athletes and hosting these students in our local offices for career development opportunities,” said Bullington.
