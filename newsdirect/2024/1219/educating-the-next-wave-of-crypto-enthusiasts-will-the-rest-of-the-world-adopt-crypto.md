As crypto surges in yet another four-year bull run cycle, mass adoption of crypto is still quite low. Here we examine the current state of affairs and look to the future of blockchain and what will drive the next wave of crypto. One coin in particular, Cutoshi, is gaining traction in the DeFi market.

Who Is Adopting Crypto And Where?According to data from Triple A, around 6.8% of the world is using or trading crypto. But which countries have the highest adoption?

With the size of the US economy and the recent pro-crypto US election win, it would be easy to assume that the US is the world leader. But as Chainalysis reports, Central & Southern Asia and Oceania are leading the way with crypto adoption. They use an interesting set of methodologies that help to even out the currency differences that might obscure the real adoption rate.

But even without these advanced methods, we see a report conducted in September, India is in the lead, with a huge 29% adoption rate. Nigeria is next with 25%, closely followed by Vietnam and then Australia.

In contrast, the US comes in at 13% and Germany at 6%.

Men are 2.8 times as likely to own crypto as women and younger people are more likely to have crypto.

Are These the Real Stats?It’s unclear how the adoption of the crypto Spot ETFs affects this data, since asset managers like BlackRock are now the biggest holders of Bitcoin. These asset managers tend to provide for large institutions, high net worth individuals and pension funds.

Because of that, many ordinary people who haven’t yet gotten into crypto may actually have indirect exposure and will not be represented by the stats above.

Given the rapidly aging workforce, lower birth rates and growing longevity of the Global North, it's likely that pension funds will continue to increase their exposure to the high yields of Bitcoin and other cryptos.

What’s Going To Happen In The Near Future?The pro-crypto Trump administration is likely to greatly boost crypto adoption in the US and beyond, signaling to the world that cryptocurrencies are a legitimate investment vehicle. This comes as the Federal Reserve officially recognized Bitcoin as ‘Digital Gold’, seeing it not as competition for the dollar, but rather as competition for gold.

The Role Of EducationWe can see mass adoption of education, as more than 68% of Americans say they don’t understand how it works and 37% of current crypto investors also feel confused.

The crypto industry is aware of this and there are many places offering crypto education such as the Polkadot Academy. However, for many, Polkadot Academy is still too technical.

Since meme coins continue to be extremely popular, especially with those new to crypto, this is one way to bring people into the fold.

The Lucky Cat Offers A Way Into CryptoCutoshi is a meme coin based on the Chinese Lucky Cat, with cute and nostalgic 8-bit graphics, reminding people of computer games from their childhood or a retro vibe.

But underneath the hood, Cutoshi is building a DeFi ecosystem. There will be a cross-chain DEX to make things less confusing, easier and cheaper for newbies and even seasoned investors.

There will also be a Cutoshi Learning Academy, in the same 8-bit style. Making learning about crypto and decentralized finance appealing and entertaining, as well as educational.

As Cutoshi is currently in presale it also offers people a potentially good opportunity for high returns. After the presale, Cutoshi will continue to bring more people to crypto, building an engaging community to increase a sense of inclusiveness. Continually refining their educational approach, so that they can introduce more of the world to crypto.
