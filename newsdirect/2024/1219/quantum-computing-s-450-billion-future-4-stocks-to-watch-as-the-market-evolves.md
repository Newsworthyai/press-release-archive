# Quantum Computing's $450 Billion Future: 4 Stocks to Watch as the Market Evolves

Quantum computing is emerging as one of the most talked-about frontiers in technology, despite commercially available quantum computers being years away. Its potential to transform industries like healthcare, finance, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence has sparked immense investor excitement, driving stock prices in the field. While the companies in this space are still in the early stages, their market potential is undeniable. In its updated analysis titled The Long-Term Forecast for Quantum Computing Still Looks Bright, BCG reaffirms its projection that quantum computing will create $450 billion to $850 billion of economic value globally, sustaining a $90 billion to $170 billion market for hardware and software providers by 2040. As quantum technologies continue to evolve, early investors could see substantial rewards if they make the right moves.

At its core, quantum computing relies on principles of quantum mechanics, allowing computers to perform certain calculations at speeds far beyond the capabilities of classical computers. Traditional computers process information in binary bits—ones or zeros—while quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This unique ability enables quantum systems to solve complex problems that would take classical computers thousands, if not millions, of years to tackle.

Though commercial applications are still a ways off, 2024 has been a strong year for quantum computing stocks. Investors are keeping a close eye on these companies, hoping they are poised for major breakthroughs that could set the stage for the next generation of computing. With that in mind, let's take a closer look at a few companies worth paying attention to in the space.

ZenaTech Inc. (Nasdaq: ZENA)ZenaTech is carving a niche at the intersection of AI-powered drones and emerging quantum computing technologies. Initially focused on enterprise SaaS and AI-driven drone solutions for industries like agriculture, logistics, and defense, the company is now making strides in the burgeoning field of land surveying and wildfire management, along with disruptive applications like traffic optimization and weather forecasting.

A Growing Presence in Land Surveying

Central to ZenaTech’s strategy is its Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS) model, which allows clients to access drone capabilities without heavy capital investment. This service model, similar to software subscription services, enables businesses to utilize ZenaDrone’s multifunctional drones for tasks like land surveys, compliance monitoring, and crop management. Recent acquisitions of two land survey firms and a third pending acquisition reflect ZenaTech’s commitment to expanding its foothold in the $10.3 billion U.S. surveying and mapping services industry.

Equipped with LiDAR, GPS systems, and high-resolution cameras, ZenaDrone can gather and process data across large terrains in hours, significantly outpacing traditional methods that can take weeks. ZenaTech aims to disrupt the surveying industry in much the same way Uber transformed transportation—offering unparalleled speed, precision, and cost-efficiency.

Leveraging Quantum Computing for Wildfire Management

In a groundbreaking move, ZenaTech announced plans to integrate quantum computing into its AI drone operations for wildfire tracking and land surveys. This initiative, driven by its partnership with Native American groups, aims to manage large-scale datasets collected by drones across vast territories. Quantum computing's advanced processing capabilities allow for real-time analysis of terrain, weather patterns, and fire conditions, enabling more accurate predictions and resource deployment.

This approach is especially important for managing wildfire risks in the Western U.S., where ZenaTech plans to anchor its operations through recent acquisitions. By combining AI drones with quantum technology, the company seeks to minimize wildfire damage and enhance fire prevention efforts, a critical need for many Native American reservations.

Expanding Defense Capabilities

ZenaTech’s subsidiary, Spider Vision Sensors Ltd., has partnered with Suntek Global to develop NDAA-compliant cameras for defense applications. The advanced vision systems will be integrated into ZenaDrone’s IQ Series drones, which are already in trials with the U.S. Air Force and Naval Research. These drones are designed for reconnaissance, surveillance, and tactical missions, offering robust solutions for defense and security sectors.

The IQ Nano drone, a compact 10x10-inch model, exemplifies ZenaTech’s versatility, catering to logistics and warehousing industries by autonomously scanning barcodes and mapping storage spaces, reducing labor costs and improving inventory accuracy.

Broadening Horizons with the Sky Traffic Project

ZenaTech has also launched the Sky Traffic project, leveraging quantum computing to optimize traffic and weather forecasting. The initiative aims to provide real-time traffic data to government agencies and drivers, improving signal management and public safety while reducing congestion. Simultaneously, drones equipped with advanced sensors will enhance weather data collection, offering faster and more precise forecasts of severe weather events like hurricanes.

Financial and Operational Highlights

Following its Nasdaq listing, ZenaTech reported a 15% year-over-year revenue increase for the nine months ending September 30, 2024. The company has also expanded operations in Phoenix, Arizona, establishing a U.S. base for manufacturing and FAA-approved testing of its ZenaDrone 1000.

With a focus on quantum computing integration, DaaS expansion, and advanced AI-driven drone applications, ZenaTech is positioning itself as a leader in transforming industries from land surveying to disaster management. Its ongoing innovations and acquisitions underscore its commitment to leveraging emerging technologies for practical, impactful solutions.

Rigetti Computing Inc.
