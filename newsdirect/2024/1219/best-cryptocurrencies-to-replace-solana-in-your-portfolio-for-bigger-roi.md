After verging on the brink of collapse in 2022, Solana has seen a strong recovery. Ecosystem upgrades and the meme coin frenzy have proven that Solana is more resilient than it seems. Despite this, cracks are starting to appear in the Solana network.

Ongoing concerns with centralization, as well as controversies around the Solana-based Pump.fun meme coin platform, are putting Solana’s potential into question. For traders that are concerned, Ethereum, Tron and a new memeFi token, Cutoshi, are potential alternatives.

Ethereum’s Dominance Remains UnchallengedWhen it first became prominent, Solana dubbed itself the “Ethereum killer,” touting its high speed and low fees. However, since then, Ethereum (ETH) has managed to retain its dominance. Despite a relatively slow cycle for the biggest DeFi network, there are no signs of anyone overtaking it.

Despite retaining dominance in DeFi, with over 50% of TVL of all chains, Ethereum has seen slow growth in price. Last year saw Ethereum underperforming, right up to the latest bull market. Now, Ethereum has recovered its losses, trading at $3,937, with an 80% yearly gain.

The underperformance was due to falling fee revenue, which impacted Ethereum’s burn rate. It turns out that layer 2 scaling solutions cannibalized fee revenue on the mainnet. However, this necessary sacrifice of short-term profits is key for Ethereum’s long-term growth.

Layer 2 solutions aim to fix the long running issue with Ethereum, its fees and scalability. If the network manages to fix those issues, it will seriously hurt Solana’s competitive edge. At the same time, Ethereum has other advantages compared to Solana. Notably, it has shown consistent reliability, with virtually no downtime since its launch. Moreover, the chain is much bigger and much more decentralized.

Tron Is Challenging Solana’s DeFi EcosystemSolana has always positioned itself as a high-performance chain with a strong ecosystem. In this field, it has a major competitor, Tron (TRX). Its strong DeFi ecosystem, high transaction volumes and recent performance challenge Solana.

Tron has retained its position as one of the largest DeFi ecosystems. Currently at $8.495 billion TVL, it holds third place, just behind Solana with $9.432 billion. What is more, its DeFi position has brought Tron to its all-time high of $0.4407 in early December.

What is more, unlike Solana, Tron is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EMV) compatible. This opens up its ecosystem to better integration with Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem.

Viral MemeFi Token Cutshi Secures $1.37 M In InvestmentsWith Solana’s ecosystem slowing down, another token, Cutoshi (CUTO) is taking the spotlight. This memeFi token is leveraging Ethereum’s ecosystem’s security to challenge Solana’s decentralized exchanges. At the same time, it is an alternative to Solana memecoins.

Cutoshi attained viral status after breaking $1.37 million in investments. The reason for this is its blend of memes and decentralization.

Cutoshi is using memes to bring more people into the DeFi space. Its multichain DEX aims to make trading accessible on all chains. However, it still leverages Ethereum's security, challenging Solana. The token’s focus on making DeFi more accessible also presents a challenge to SOL.
