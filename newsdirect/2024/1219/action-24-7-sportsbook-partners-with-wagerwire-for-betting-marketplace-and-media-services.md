# Action 24/7 Sportsbook Partners with WagerWire for Betting Marketplace and Media Services

Action 24/7, a major Tennessee sportsbook, today announced it is partnering with California-based sports betting technology and media provider WagerWire to launch ActionWire™, a marketplace for active sports bets on the Action 24/7 sportsbook. This first-of-its-kind partnership will give Tennessee sports bettors unprecedented value and optionality, enabling them to buy and sell previously placed wagers on an open secondary market.

The partnership kicks off with a marketing and media collaboration as the two companies work towards integrating the marketplace into the Action 24/7 app. This marks the latest online sportsbook in the United States to implement WagerWire’s revolutionary secondary market feature, which has also proven to be very successful in daily fantasy and social casino settings.

“We’re proud to bring innovation directly to our Tennessee community,” said Andrew Jacks, GM, of Operations at Action 24/7. “ActionWire is more than just a feature; it’s a game-changer for how our players connect with and control their bets. Offering such a differentiating feature will continue to make us an attractive option for bettors looking for a sportsbook that focuses on player empowerment.”

The marketplace allows bettors to treat their wagers as liquid assets that can be bought and sold, in whole or in part, at any time until the buzzer, creating a new standard for innovation and player engagement in the online sports betting industry.

“Our mission is to empower bettors and unlock value for operators, so we are thrilled to be working with the team at Action 24/7 that also live by these principles and go above and beyond to cater to their passionate local fanbase in the Tennessee market.” said Zach Doctor, WagerWire CEO. “This marks another important milestone for our company as we bring our solution to the licensed OSB market following the great results we’ve seen so far in other forms of real money gaming.”

As part of the partnership with Action 24/7, Tennessee’s only locally-owned sportsbook, WagerWire will amplify big ticket stories to generate brand awareness for the sportsbook as well as secure potential buyers. One such example unfolding in real time is with a Tennessee bettor named Calvin who holds a parlay with the final leg hinging on Ohio State winning the 2025 College Football National Championship.

“I stand to win $437,000 if Ohio State wins the championship, but between a tough path and a wide-open field, the Buckeyes still have their work cut out for them,” Calvin said. “If this was an Action 24/7 ticket I could post it on ActionWire and engage offers for all or part of it, as opposed to just sitting back and hoping Ohio State can win four consecutive tough games. I imagine any bettors in a similar position would love to have the ability to sell at least part of a bet like this.”

WagerWire and Action 24/7 will also combine to participate in social media engagement across TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and X, with a focus on community-driven storytelling as well as contests, giveaways, branded ad wrappers on video content, and hyper-targeted campaigns for Tennessee bettors. Wire Media, WagerWire’s media arm, has seen rapid growth since its launch in early 2024, signaling a strong foundation for driving the partnership's marketing and engagement strategies.
