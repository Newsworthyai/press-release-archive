# AdvicePay Wins 2024 ThinkAdvisor Luminaries Firm Award – Industry Disruption for Financial Planning

AdvicePay, the industry-leading platform for managing billing, payments, and compliance of fee-for-service financial planning, announced that it has won the 2024 ThinkAdvisor Luminaries Firm Award – Industry Disruption for financial planning in recognition of several new features and integrations.

Among the features acknowledged are the Reviewer role, which allows the Home Office to review a deliverable and its supporting documentation in one place, and Attestations, which verifies that both advisors and reviewers followed a firm’s processes when developing and approving deliverables. Earlier this year, the company also integrated with eMoney to provide a single sign-in for advisors while offering other features that make it easier to navigate between the two platforms. In addition to eMoney, AdvicePay offers integrations with other leading fintech providers such as DocuSign, Wealthbox, Salesforce and Pontera.

“I’m so proud of our entire AdvicePay team for their quality work and tenacity over the past year and since our inception,” said AdvicePay President, Kelsey Lewis. "This award is a testament to our team's dedication to our mission and to supporting our customers. We're passionate about helping firms embrace fee-for-service planning, and a big part of that is making it easy for the back office to manage. When the process is simple, it's easier for firms to prioritize this model, ensuring advisors can get paid for their knowledge and focus on delivering exceptional value to clients."

Last year, AdvicePay’s enterprise customers experienced 36% growth in advisors among firms that adopted all modules including eSignature, Online Check Deposit, and Deliverables.

Launched in 2018, AdvicePay now serves more than 11,000 users and has processed 1.5+ million transactions totaling more than $720 million in financial planning fees from more than 215,000 clients.

The 2024 ThinkAdvisor Luminaries were announced last week during the MarketCounsel Summit in Las Vegas. For this year’s program, ThinkAdvisor introduced a broadened awards scope, with an expanded focus on fintech. The publication selected 242 finalist organizations and 85 winners for its fourth-annual program.
