# Nevis Brands Expands Major Distribution with Exclusive Licensing Agreement in Mississippi

--News Direct--

Nevis Brands CEO John Kueber joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce the company has announced a significant expansion in Major's distribution through an exclusive licensing agreement with Stash House for production and distribution in Mississippi. Under this agreement, Stash House will have exclusive rights to produce and distribute the full lineup of Major products in the state.

The Major lineup includes dose-able 100mg THC beverages available in flavors such as Blueberry, Fruit Punch, and Blackberry Lemonade. Known for delivering the effects of cannabis within a short timeframe of 10-20 minutes after consumption, Major has gained popularity since its initial launch in Washington State in 2019, with over 5 million bottles sold to date.

Kueber highlighted Mississippi's recent legalization of cannabis for medical use in January 2023, which has led to the licensing of over 400 dispensaries in the state. This agreement marks Major's entry into its 10th state for production, further expanding its reach across the United States. Currently available in Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Ohio, Colorado, Nevada, California, and Missouri, Major is also preparing for production in Michigan, signaling the brand's continued growth and market penetration.
