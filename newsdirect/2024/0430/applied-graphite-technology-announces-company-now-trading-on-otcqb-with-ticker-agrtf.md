Applied Graphite Technology Corporation CEO Don Baxter joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce a significant milestone with the successful completion of the cross-listing of its common shares on the OTCQB Venture market. The company's common shares are now actively trading on the OTCQB under the ticker symbol "AGRTF", while still maintaining its primary listing on the TSX Venture Exchange under the ticker symbol "AGT".

CEO Don Baxter emphasized the strategic importance of this listing, highlighting the opportunity it presents for Applied Graphite Technologies to tap into a large United States investor base. This move is expected to not only allow investors to directly participate in the company's growth but also enhance trading liquidity and broaden outreach within the global investment community.
