# FTN Network Premiers NBA Proprietary Data for Customers for 2024 Season

FTN Network, a company built for delivering affordable, customizable and highly detailed sports data for media companies, bettors, fantasy sports and DFS, announced today that it will premier NBA data on its platform of charted, proprietary information. Starting with the 2024–25 season, NBA data will be available to all FTN Data customers, and to FTN Fantasy subscribers at a later date. FTN will track 19 distinct data points aimed at offering unique context into player evaluations, covering everything from fundamental offensive and defensive sets to intricate and advanced analytics.

The collected data will place an emphasis on the impact of the defensive side of the ball. With the last 4 league-MVP awards going to true Centers (Nikola Jokic and Joel Embiid), FTN will equip data subscribers with the resources necessary to highlight the extensive impact some of the league’s most dominant players have on neutralizing opposing offensive superstars. The advanced metrics will provide insights into ball screen coverages, post-defense, off-ball defensive actions, contested shot data and contested rebound data, going deeper than simply tracking who secures a rebound and where.

"We want to revolutionize the way individuals analyze and engage with the sport of basketball. This includes enhancing the experience from both a betting and fantasy perspective, as well as for regular viewers of the game down the line. Our objective with the charting database is to drive innovation for sports analytics,” said Frank Brank, Chief Data Officer at FTN. “We want to offer services and insights that may go unnoticed by other platforms. Users will have intel like a defensive scout, including how teams defend against specific offensive formations, as well as offensive efficiency metrics that highlight the effectiveness of these defensive strategies.”

Building on its extensive NFL data and unique expertise with its DVOA/DYAR metrics, FTN’s addition of NBA analytics will help enhance customers’ viewership experience and boost the entertainment value of the sport. The following data points will be collected by FTN for its charting database: possession type, play type, shot type, defensive alignment, after time-out situations, short clock situations, ball screen defensive coverages, screen locations, screen participants, off-ball action coverages, post defense, post play participants, deflections, potential assists, shot contest types, shot contest hands, contests by player, rebound locations, and rebound contests.

“The launch of our NBA data for the upcoming season further establishes FTN as the one stop shop for all things fantasy, betting and fan engagement,” said Perry Gershon, chief executive officer at FTN. “It allows users to go beyond the box score in this new era of the game, making it a truly innovate tool in the sports data industry.”

This additional data offering comes at a time when FTN is experiencing impressive growth. Total subscription revenue (monthly and annual combined) grew 16 percent for the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the same period last year. The main driver of that growth is its fantasy football product on ftnfantasy.com, which historically sells best between July and September. For that specific 3-month period, FTN’s subscription revenue grew 22 percent compared to 2023. FTN Data revenue also grew substantially (by 211% over the same period last year), driven by an increased visibility of the product.
