# Cutoshi (CUTO) Has Completed Stage 3 Of Presale Ahead Of Schedule, Here's Everything You Need To Know

![](https://public.newsdirect.com/834774815/99pZ4tFu.jpeg)

As a crypto meme coin trader, one of the most infuriating things about meme coins is that usually by the time you’ve heard of them, it's already too late as the price has pumped so much. Cutoshi is still in presale, meaning that potential buyers still have time to get on board.

If you’re still wondering what the fuss is about, here’s what you need to know before it’s too late.

Where Is Cutoshi At?Stage 3 of the presale has just finished and stage 4 is underway. This happened a lot earlier than expected, putting the price of $CUTO at $0.031. This puts holders from the start at a rewarding 100% profit. Since there are many more stages to go and lots of community support, there is a lot of room for price appreciation.

The project has already raised over $1.29 million and interest is continuing to grow.

Why Did Stage 3 Finish So Quickly?The early completion of Stage 3 wasn’t a fluke but rather a result of growing interest in what Cutoshi has to offer. Putting aside its unique hybrid utility as a meme coin that meets DeFi, what factors led to Stage 3 ending so quickly?

Memetic PowerThe internet runs on memes, particularly in crypto, where the majority of the buyers are late millennials or younger, people who’ve mostly grown up with internet memes being ubiquitous. This trend continues as we move into web3 users, as this report says, “the average Web3 user is 30 years old” and “users between the ages of 25 and 34 make up more than 45% of Web3 platform users.”

Cutoshi’s Lucky Cat mascot has managed to cut through the usual crowd of frogs and dogs dominating meme coins. It’s simple, recognizable and perfect for memes. You’ve probably seen it pop up on X recently in everything from animated GIFs to hand-drawn fan art and pictures painted in a graffiti style.

Trending On X During ThanksgivingThe report also mentions how the largest number of web3 users are from the US. And that makes sense when we know that $CUTO has been trending on X three times recently, once right before Thanksgiving.

And that helps us to understand why $CUTO saw a spike in activity around Thanksgiving, with the younger members of the family eating Turkey and spilling the tea - attracting hundreds of thousands of dollars of investment on that day.

FOMO In ActionFor those who decided to take a crypto-free day and then check in on Cutoshi, they were amazed to see that stage 3 was selling out, taking the coin to a 100% profit from the beginning of the presale.

We’ve all experienced FOMO and so many people, rather than buy Bitcoin at the ultimate top (hey, it might work but there are better strategies), decided to get into a promising presale that they know still has many rounds to go before it is even ready to enter the final stages of price discovery - such as listing on a DEX and beyond.

Cutoshi’s Fundamentals Underpin EverythingUnlike a conventional meme coin, Cutoshi is based on a solid idea - bringing DeFi to the masses. Their plan for this consists of a cross-chain DEX, designed to offer lower fees and make bridging between blockchains easier for users.

Another major feature is the NFT collection, which will include exclusive Lucky Cat-themed collectibles tied to the project’s branding. And people can pay in CUTO, adding further utility to the token.

Cutoshi is also proud of their upcoming learning academy, which will be fun and beautiful (in an old-school computer game kind of way) and encourage so many more people to get into web3 and DeFi and how to make the most of it!
