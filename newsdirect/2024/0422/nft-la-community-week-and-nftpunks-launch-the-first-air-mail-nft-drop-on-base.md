Nashville, TN, April 22, 2024 â€“ (PlatoAi via 500NewsWire) -- In 2022, NFT LA was created to bring together the people who are at the foundation of creating the Web3 future. There is no time more important than now to inspire, connect, and educate each other and grow the Web3 future together. NFT LA was the place where we, as a community, do exactly that.

NFTPunks was established to think differently and bring utility to NFTs, we believe that blockchain is all about community. In honoring the spirit of community, we reflect on the loss of our esteemed member, Michael Brooks, affectionately known as "The Rook." In his memory, we are proud to announce our collaboration with NFTPunks and aivo.ai to release a limited edition commemorative NFT celebrating his contributions.

This NFT drop will be a landmark event, as it will be the largest Air-mail NFT drop ever on the Base Chain, directly sent to our community via email. No wallet is required on your end, as one will be automatically generated for you through Horus Wallet. Simply visit horuswallet.com, log in with this email, and a new wallet will be created for you, enabling you to claim the NFT.

We hope that this tribute brings joy and fond remembrance to our vibrant NFT community.
