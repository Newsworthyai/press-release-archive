# Capturing Consumer Spending on Health Care with XLV

--News Direct--

With consumer spending on health care continuing to increase, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) provides an opportunity for investors to leverage this trend. XLV tracks health care stocks within the S&P 500 Index, offering broad exposure to core companies in the U.S. healthcare sector.

The fund's top holdings* are comprised of market leaders across several sub-sectors of healthcare including companies such as Eli LIlly & Co (11.34%), Unitedhealth Group (8.36%), Johnson & Johnson (6.96%), Merck & Co (6.11%), AbbVie Inc. (5.87%), Thermo Fisher Scientific (4.10%), Abbott Laboratories (3.61%), Danaher Corp (3.00%), Pfizer (2.86%), and Amgen (2.78%).

Growth Drivers in the Healthcare Sector

As the health care sector continues to grow, these companies are well-positioned to benefit from increased consumer spending. The growth history in this sector has been driven by several factors, including a rise in chronic diseases, an aging population, and advancing medical technology.

Total spending on health care rose from 16% of GDP in 2007 to an estimated 18% in 2023. Simultaneously, the total GDP has risen nearly 70% in that time, from 14.47 trillion in 2007 to 25.5 trillion in 2022.

Investing in XLV offers a diversified way to capture steady consumer spending on health care. By investing in the health care market in a broad way, the ups and downs of a particular big name in the sector are mitigated by the exposure to other healthcare companies.
