Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer just a buzzword; it’s quite literally transforming the world as we know it.

Anyone with a smartphone or access to the internet now has AI at their fingertips, but few realize the crucial role critical minerals play in the AI revolution.

Critical minerals like copper, lithium and even uranium, are the foundation modern technology is built upon. They are an essential ingredient in everything from electric vehicles and smart grids to smartphones and batteries, sending demand skyrocketing in recent years.

The influx of new AI data centers being built across the globe is also driving demand for critical minerals to new highs. Amazon plans to spend almost US$150 billion over the next 15 years to build and operate data centers around the world, while Microsoft will spend nearly $6 billion on AI data centers in the UK and Japan.

The problem is, the aggressive pace of AI adoption and the rising number of energy-sucking AI data centers is putting additional strain on global supply chains that are already stretched thin by net-zero goals.

Add to that years of underinvestment in new mines and concentrated supply in high-risk regions, and it becomes clear that supply will struggle to keep pace with the rising demand.

As critical minerals become scarcer, their value increases and according to a new report from The Oregon Group, it could trigger a 10-year supercycle.
