With the recent developments incorporated in the 2025 lineup of Supra Boats, users can get easy water access with the push of a button by DropStep, while electric power assist steering affords the driver a near-effortless wheel for fast, responsive handling to dial in a much smoother ride over the roughest waters. The latest technology in Dynamic Sound Design delivers sound quality regardless of the volume and seat positions of the users. The Supra Tower merges style with functionality by coming with pre-installed speakers to produce high-quality sound while enhancing its looks on the boat.

The 2025 lineup introduces the Supra SV, measuring 21 feet and 10 inches, to combine high performance with luxury. It can seat as many as 15 passengers, with a ballast capacity of 3,800 pounds. The Supra SA is 22.5 feet, has a sleek design with advanced features, and is executed in rough water boat conditions to give a comfortable ride. With the supercharged 550 engine, Zero Off, and Autowake, it surfs through rough waters with precision control. The SA can hold 16 passengers with a 3,500-pound ballast, accommodating those seeking power and control.

Moreover, seventeen passengers can easily combine style and Supra SL performance. Available in this boat is 23.5 feet and 4,000 pounds in ballast, which ensures good comfort and stability in rough water conditions. Supra SE, the top-of-the-line variant, reaches 24.5 feet and holds up to 18 passengers compared with the inboard, boasting 4,700 pounds of ballast capacity to handle rough waters and make the ride ultra-smooth for larger groups.
