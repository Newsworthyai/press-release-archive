The global uranium market is experiencing a wave of activity, marked by a significant uptick in production and the greenlighting of new projects.

In the United States, uranium production made a stunning comeback in early 2024, outpacing the entire output of the previous year. Across the border, Saskatchewan is on the cusp of launching what could become Canada’s largest uranium mining project.

According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), domestic uranium production in the first quarter of 2024 exceeded the total for all of 2023, with over 82,000 pounds of uranium concentrate (U3O8) mined—a 64% jump from the 50,000 pounds produced last year.1 The 2023 slump was largely attributed to the shutdown of Utah's only uranium mill, but a surge in exploration and drilling activities throughout 2023 has fueled the current rebound. Despite this production surge, the spot price for U3O8 in Canada has dipped to $81.75 per pound, the lowest point of 2024 so far.

The increase in US uranium production reflects a broader trend of renewed interest and investment in the uranium sector, which is also evident in Canada with significant new projects on the horizon.

Saskatchewan is gearing up to host the country’s largest uranium mining project as NexGen Energy moves forward with the Rook I Project. Located 130 kilometers north of La Loche, the project recently received provincial approval under Saskatchewan’s Environmental Assessment Act,2 marking the first time in over two decades that a greenfield uranium project has secured full environmental assessment approval in the province. While federal approval is still pending, NexGen plans to have the project operational by the end of the decade.

Saskatchewan’s Energy and Resources Minister, Jim Reiter, remains optimistic about the province's critical minerals industry, despite challenges like labor shortages and setbacks in rare earth elements processing. He expressed confidence in the sector’s long-term potential, driven by growing global demand for critical minerals essential for renewable energy and battery technologies.

Another company making progress on an exciting uranium project in Canada is Generation Uranium (TSXV:GEN) (OTCQB:GENRF), a natural resource company that holds a 100% interest in the Yath Uranium Project, located in the prolific and under-explored Thelon Basin in Nunavut, Canada. The Yath project is situated along trend from the 43 million lbs Lac 50 uranium deposit, which is being advanced by Latitude Uranium, a company acquired by ATHA Energy in an all-share transaction valued at $64.7 million.3

Historical exploration at Yath has consistently revealed uranium concentrations between 1% and 10% U3O8, highlighting its significant promise.4

Generation Uranium to Launch Advanced Survey at Yath Uranium Project in Collaboration with Atha EnergyGeneration Uranium (TSXV:GEN) (OTCQB:GENRF) is ramping up its exploration efforts at the highly anticipated Yath Uranium Project in Nunavut, Canada, with the launch of a cutting-edge airborne electromagnetic survey. This bold move is set to redefine the exploration landscape in one of Canada’s most promising uranium districts.

In a strategic collaboration with ATHA Energy Corp, Generation Uranium has engaged the services of Expert Geophysics Ltd., a pioneer in geophysical survey technologies, to deploy their advanced Mobile MagnetoTellurics (MMT) system. This system, known for its unparalleled accuracy, will employ the latest airborne AFMAG (Audio-frequency Magnetic) technology to map out electromagnetic (EM) anomalies across the vast 123.45 km² Yath property.

The survey will span 890 line-kilometers with an impressive 150-meter line spacing, meticulously collecting high-resolution magnetic and VLF data. This comprehensive survey aims to unlock the hidden treasures within Yath, positioning it as a potential game-changer in the uranium sector. What makes this initiative even more exciting is its integration with Atha Energy’s larger survey, creating a powerful synergy that reduces costs and accelerates the exploration timeline.

"We are pleased to have procured the services of Expert Geophysics to initiate some of the most advanced mapping technology available in the industry,” said Generation Uranium CEO Anthony Zelen. “Our collaboration with Atha Energy makes sense by using economies of scale to deliver a cost-effective way to survey Yath and advance the project towards the drill.”

This ambitious exploration effort is a testament to Generation Uranium’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in uranium exploration. With over $6 million already invested in Yath by the company and previous property owners, the upcoming survey is expected to yield valuable insights that could pinpoint new high-priority drill targets and propel the project to new heights.

Generation Uranium Partners with APEX Geoscience to Advance Yath Project Towards Diamond Drilling CampaignLast month, Generation Uranium (TSXV:GEN) (OTCQB:GENRF) entered into a strategic partnership with APEX Geoscience to enhance its exploration activities at the Yath Uranium Project in Nunavut, Canada. As part of this collaboration, APEX will provide comprehensive geological consulting services, with a focus on advancing the project toward a much-anticipated diamond drilling campaign.

Under the agreement, APEX Geoscience will oversee the preparation and submission of all necessary exploration authorization applications for the upcoming drilling program. This includes thorough groundwork and coordination with key regulatory bodies, such as the Nunavut Planning Commission, the Nunavut Impact Review Board, and the Kivalliq Inuit Association, to ensure full compliance with regulatory and community requirements.

This engagement with APEX is timely, as Generation Uranium seeks to build on historical data that points to significant uranium potential at Yath. Past explorations have identified high-grade uranium deposits, with recent surveys by Kivalliq Energy further validating these findings.

The partnership highlights Generation Uranium's commitment to utilizing expert knowledge and advanced technology to unlock the Yath Uranium Project's full potential, laying the groundwork for future development and economic growth in the region.
