# CPV Renewables Begins Construction on Wind Project in Pennsylvania, CPV’s Third Project Utilizing Former Coal Mine Land

Today Competitive Power Ventures’ (CPV) affiliate, CPV Renewable Power (CPV Renewables) announced the start of construction for CPV Rogue’s Wind in Pennsylvania. The 114 MW wind project, stretching across Cambria and Clearfield Counties, will be CPV’s third project that repurposes former coal mine land into a new source of renewable energy.

Upon completion, it will become CPV’s third operating project in Cambria County following CPV Maple Hill Solar and the CPV Fairview Energy Center.

“The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has consistently been a strong state to do business in with CPV Fairview coming online in 2019 and CPV Maple Hill, the state’s largest solar project at the time, following in 2023,” said Gary Lambert, CEO of CPV. “With construction beginning on CPV Rogue’s Wind, we will soon be able to showcase all three types of generation in our operating portfolio; a testament to how we at CPV envision a reliable, low carbon electric supply needed to drive a responsible energy transition forward.”

“CPV Rogue’s Wind highlights our commitment to developing in energy communities where we can have a positive impact. As our third project where we revitalize former coal mine land, we can show how brownfield development helps to bring vital resources to areas that need it most,” said Sean Finnerty, President of CPV Renewables. “At the end of the day, we want to play an active role in the region alongside our community partners while bringing a clean energy source to Pennsylvania’s electricity customers.”

CPV Rogue’s Wind is the first project tied to the company’s recent partnership announcement with Harrison Street, one of the leading investment management firms exclusively focused on alternative real assets with approximately $55 billion in assets under management. The partnership, in which Harrison Street acquired one-third of CPV Renewables, will support an accelerated build out of the 4 GW renewable development pipeline.

“The construction of CPV Rogue’s Wind is an important milestone in our long-term partnership with CPV Renewables,” said Carolyn Arida, Senior Managing Director at Harrison Street. “This project exemplifies our commitment to sustainable infrastructure, and we look forward to building on this success and continuing our collaboration with CPV to deliver innovative renewable energy projects across the country.”

CPV Rogue’s Wind will consist of 19 Vestas V-162 wind turbines and, once complete, will deliver enough electricity to the grid to support approximately 32,000 households. At the same time, the reduction in CO2 emissions annually is equivalent to taking approximately 28,400 cars off the road.

A Focus on Land Revitalization & Community Engagement

With CPV’s commitment to targeting Energy Communities, CPV Rogue’s Wind will repurpose the former coal mine land while working alongside the active recreational area, generate new revenue for the local municipalities, and create hundreds of jobs throughout the construction process.

“With CPV at the helm of the Rogue’s Wind renewable energy project, the Cambria County Conservation and Recreation Authority, after more than 15 years of hope, is finally converting a long-standing dream to a reality,” said Tom Kakabar, Chair of the Cambria County Conservation and Recreation Authority. “The professional team at CPV has been a true partner and has pitched another ‘perfect game win’ for renewable energy development within Cambia County. Kudos to the CPV team.”

CPV Rogue’s Wind will also act as an educational experience for patrons of the nearby Rock Run Recreation Area. The recreational park allows outdoor enthusiasts to explore over 140 miles of trails, some bringing them to the base of the project’s turbines.

“By partnering with CPV and the Cambria County Conservation Authority, we are bringing in much needed revenue to the Cambria County Recreation Authority, The Township, and Rock Run while providing clean energy to the region,” said Gary Haluska, Chairman of Rock Run’s Board of Directors.

CPV Rogue’s Wind is expected to reach commercial operation in 2026. The project is part of the company’s 10 GW pipeline of renewable and dispatchable generation projects, including utility-scale power generation with carbon capture to help the U.S. meet its decarbonization goals.
