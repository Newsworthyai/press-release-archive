# Comcast to Expand Fiber Network in Tulare County

Comcast announced today it will expand its smart, fast, reliable, fiber-rich Xfinity network in Tulare County, California. The project will bring Comcast’s next-generation, best-in-class broadband network to approximately 6,200 previously unserved locations in areas of Alpaugh, Dinuba, Earlimart, Kingsburg, Pixley, Sultana, Traver, Tulare, Visalia, and Tipton and is expected to be completed by early 2026. The planned expansion adds to Comcast’s more than $4 billion in technology and infrastructure investments across California in the last three years.

The expansion is made possible by a more than $26 million Federal Funding Account Grant from the California Public Utilities Commission and private funding by Comcast.

These locations will have Comcast’s next-generation network, built on DOCSIS 4.0 technology, which enables symmetrical, multi-gigabit Internet options that deliver optimal upload and download speeds and performance.

“Today’s announcement builds on our collective unwavering commitment and efforts to close the digital divide in California,” said David Tashjian, Regional Senior Vice President of Comcast. “Comcast is proud to partner with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to bring reliable, high-speed Internet access to several communities across Tulare County, by early 2026. By continuing to invest in public-private partnerships such as this, Comcast will bring its best-in-class broadband services to previously unserved locations and help ensure that no one is left behind, no matter their economic status or where they live.”

“I’m thankful to both the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and Comcast for their continued commitment and investments to bridging the digital divide in Tulare County,” said Larry Micari, Chair of the Tulare County Board of Supervisors. “High-speed, reliable Internet is no longer a luxury. This investment will provide more than 6,200 previously unserved homes and businesses in our communities with an accessible and affordable Internet connection to help families succeed, students thrive in school, businesses drive economic growth and foster greater innovation throughout the region.”

Comcast’s commitment to new communities goes beyond the build—addressing digital opportunities in communities through Project UP, the company’s $1 billion dollar commitment to help tens of millions of people connect to the Internet and build futures of unlimited possibilities. Over the past three years, Comcast has invested more than $130.5 million in cash and in-kind donations into California nonprofits focused on helping people build digital skills, expanding WiFi connected Lift Zones and funding connectivity and Internet adoption programs.

Comcast’s funding also supports ongoing efforts to build awareness about affordable connectivity services like Internet Essentials, which offers eligible households high-speed Internet for $9.95/month or Internet Essentials Plus for $29.95/month. Affordable computers are also available through Internet Essentials. Since its inception in 2011, the program has connected more than 2.2 million Californians.

Residential customers will be able to take advantage of Xfinity’s full suite of products, including Internet, video, mobile, voice and managed home solutions.
