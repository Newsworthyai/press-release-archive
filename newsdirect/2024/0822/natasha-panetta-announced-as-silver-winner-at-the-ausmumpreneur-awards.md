The AusMumpreneur Awards, presented by The Women’s Business School, celebrate and recognize mothers in business achieving outstanding success in areas such as business excellence, product development, customer service, and digital innovation. The awards are designed to acknowledge the growing number of women who successfully balance motherhood and business in a way that suits their life and family.

Busy Goddess Marketing Co. was founded by Natasha after many years of managing high-level teams and witnessing agencies fall short on promises, experience staff churn, and suffer communication issues. Natasha wanted to create a solution—a CMO, marketing manager, social media manager, content creator—providing one comprehensive solution, one contact, and a relationship built to stand the test of time.

With over 20 years of experience across various industries, Natasha specializes in tailored marketing strategies, social media management, content creation, website development, and more, with a focus on integrity, quality, and client satisfaction. Natasha’s hands-on approach and commitment to her clients have positioned Busy Goddess Marketing Co. as a trusted partner for businesses looking to elevate their brand and achieve meaningful results.

"As the founder, designer, content creator, graphic designer, website developer, and more, my hands-on approach guarantees quality, continuity, and most of all, cohesion. I relish being someone who is sought for advice and guidance, so when people think about marketing and social media, they think first of me and refer others to me," Natasha shared.

Natasha Panetta is the Female Founder and Mumpreneur of Busy Goddess Marketing Co., offering marketing and media solutions with a difference. With over 20 years of experience in marketing and media across various industries and sectors, Natasha has amassed multi-layered and diverse knowledge and expertise, which she applies to all marketing services she offers. Her passion lies in supporting women who aspire to make a difference, drive change, and build better lives for themselves and their families.

"Understanding that a personal touch and a one-on-one commitment to your business and marketing efforts do indeed elevate outcomes, communication, and overall happiness," Natasha explained. Her vision is to create an environment fostering connection, prosperity, and meaning for all through collaboration and honesty.

Natasha was excited to be recognized in this category because, “It has been a lot of true hard work, determination, and sacrifice that has gotten me to this point. At 41, having overcome PTSD, early trauma, addiction, domestic violence, and workplace challenges since leaving home at 15, every step of my success has been hard-earned and culminates into what I/we see today in Busy Goddess Marketing Co.”

To be named in the top 8 for her key business category across Australia, and then be announced as the Silver award recipient, is a true achievement.

It can be challenging to be a successful businesswoman while raising a family, and Natasha gives this advice to others thinking about starting their own enterprise: “It only takes one idea, but a whole lot of elbow grease. Be prepared for ebbs and flows in income, longer-than-normal hours, and time to finesse your best practices, processes, and approach. As you grow, you will shift and change—and be open to that no matter your level. Remaining coachable is crucial. Aspire to Inspire each and every day.”
