# Top AI Stocks to Watch Under $5

Artificial intelligence has emerged as a dominant theme over the past year, with the stock market rapidly recognizing its potential. Companies across various sectors are integrating AI solutions into their core business models to reduce costs, enhance performance, and explore new market opportunities.

The global AI market is set for explosive growth, projected to reach $826 billion by 2030, driven by a compound annual growth rate of 28.46% from 2024 to 2030, according to Statista. This growth is reflected in the technology sector's performance, with the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index soaring 69% since the start of 2023, largely fueled by advancements in AI.

With AI’s rapid expansion creating new opportunities, these four stocks under $5 could be worth exploring in this evolving sector.

Its proprietary technology powers millions of interactions annually across automotive, customer service, and IoT sectors, with products like Smart Answering and Dynamic Drive-Thru driving the company’s reputation for speed and accuracy.

In Q2 2024, SOUN reported record revenue of $13.5 million, a 54% increase from the previous year. CEO Keyvan Mohajer noted this as a "milestone quarter," highlighted by the acquisition of Amelia, a move that expanded SoundHound’s reach across verticals like banking and Fortune 500 companies. Post-acquisition, SoundHound now serves 200 marquee customers globally, accelerating its presence in the generative AI-powered customer service market.

BigBear.ai (NYSE: BBAI) stands out as a prominent player in the AI sector, particularly in areas such as national security, digital identity, and supply chain management. The company's recent developments showcase its strategic position and the potential for significant growth in the AI-driven decision intelligence market.

BigBear.ai’s strategic initiatives, such as the development of the ConductorOS platform, highlight the company's commitment to delivering cutting-edge solutions.

BigBear.ai reported a 3.4% increase in revenue for the second quarter of 2024, reaching $39.8 million, compared to $38.5 million in the same quarter of 2023. This growth was driven by higher-margin solutions and the integration of revenue from its Pangiam acquisition. The gross margin also improved to 27.8% from 23.3% year-over-year, signaling a positive trend in profitability despite the planned wind-down of the Air Force EPASS program.

However, the company faced challenges, including the timing of customer awards and regulatory approvals, which led to a downward adjustment of its full-year guidance to $165–$180 million. While the net loss decreased to $11.7 million from $16.9 million in the previous year, the ongoing non-recurring integration costs and strategic initiatives continued to impact the bottom line.

BigBear.ai's recent contract wins and partnerships underscore its expanding influence across various sectors. The company's collaboration with Concept Solutions in the FAA’s Information Technology Innovative Procurement Strategic Sourcing (ITIPSS) contract is particularly noteworthy. This multiple-award IDIQ contract, with a shared ceiling of $2.4 billion over ten years, positions BigBear.ai as a critical partner in delivering IT solutions and emerging technologies to the FAA.

Additionally, BigBear.ai’s involvement in significant projects like the DoD’s T-REX-24-2 event and its partnerships with major airports, such as Heathrow and Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, showcase its growing role in implementing AI-powered solutions in critical infrastructure. These developments contribute to a robust backlog, which stood at $266 million as of June 30, 2024.
