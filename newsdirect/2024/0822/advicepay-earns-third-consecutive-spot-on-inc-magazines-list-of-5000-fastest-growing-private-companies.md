# AdvicePay Earns Third Consecutive Spot on Inc. Magazine’s ‘List of 5000 Fastest-Growing Private Companies’

AdvicePay, the industry-leading platform for processing payments and overseeing compliance of fee-for-service financial planning, announced today that it has earned a spot on Inc. Magazine’s ‘List of the 5000 Fastest-Growing Private Companies’ for the third year in a row. With an impressive 322% revenue growth over the past three years, AdvicePay continues to demonstrate its market leadership, fueled by the industry’s growing adoption of fee-based models.

AdvicePay secured an overall rank of 1,610 on the Inc. 5000 list, along with the No. 4 position in Bozeman, No. 2 in Montana, and the 195th among the nation’s fastest-growing software companies.

“Being recognized as one of the fastest-growing private companies in the nation for three consecutive years is an incredible honor,” said AdvicePay founder and CEO Alan Moore. “At AdvicePay, we are on a mission to empower financial professionals to add new revenue streams and diversify their practices through fee-for-service planning. We are thrilled that many of the industry’s largest RIAs and broker-dealers have responded to our message and that there is a strong appetite for tools to streamline the process of fee-for-service financial planning.”

Founded by respected financial planning experts Michael Kitces and Alan Moore, AdvicePay has grown to become the industry-leading solution to empower advisors to get paid for advice – this includes all aspects related to fee-for-service financial planning, including billing, compliance, oversight, agreements and more. The company’s robust solution has gained widespread adoption, with 19 of the 25 largest brokerage firms offering fee-for-service financial planning through AdvicePay.

In November, AdvicePay announced that it had completed its one-millionth transaction since its launch in 2018. Over the past two years, AdvicePay has experienced a 102% increase in advisors added to the platform and a 193% growth in transaction volume.
