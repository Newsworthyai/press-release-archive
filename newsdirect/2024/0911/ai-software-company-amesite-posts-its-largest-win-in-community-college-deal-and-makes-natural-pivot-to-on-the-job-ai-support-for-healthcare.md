Education is getting an overhaul thanks to artificial intelligence (AI) and companies like Amesite (NASDAQ: AMST). The Detroit-based AI software company develops products and platforms to improve online learning. Leveraging GPT-4, the AI system powering Bing and ChatGPT Plus, Amesite says that online courses can be added quickly, programs are adaptable and users stay engaged.

That approach to learning is getting attention from educators, particularly with community colleges around the country. Maricopa Corporate College (MCOR) is part of the Maricopa Community College District (MCCCD), Arizona’s largest workforce developer. MCOR recently signed an agreement with Amesite.

Expanding Its College Reach Amesite just inked a multiyear deal to provide programs through MCOR, to provide AI-based online training and development. With roughly 140,000 students, MCCCD is Arizona’s largest workforce developer, playing a central role in charting the future of the Greater Phoenix region. The school system produces the second-largest number of college graduates in Arizona and creates one out of every 28 jobs in Maricopa County, adding $7.9 billion to the economy. This exclusive agreement marks the biggest customer yet for the AI software company.

It's exactly the type of enterprise Amesite is targeting. With a focus on community colleges, the company now counts seven institutions as customers offering students and faculty the Amesite LCE platform. Installations span the United States, with colleges in Alabama, Illinois, Louisiana, South Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia and now, Arizona. Collectively, colleges that have chosen Amesite train over 200,000 learners each year, reports the company.

"Our AI-powered solution enables professional learners to get information – and support – in real-time,” said Dr. Ann Marie Sastry, CEO of Amesite, in a press release announcing the deal with Maricopa. “We have long believed that AI-assisted professional training would replace traditional training and are pleased to see our solutions gaining acceptance, now with larger colleges. We are especially pleased to be the first to provide the right tools in this market."

In Amesite’s vision for education and upskilling, learners aren’t taught in isolated silos but rather are part of a larger learning community. V6, the latest version of its learning platform, is the fruition of that AI-driven vision. It offers capabilities such as learning and creative assistants, and supports educational games, interactive learning experiences and other learning incentives to keep students engaged. V6 can integrate thousands of application programming interfaces (API), which means it works with most companies’ and schools’ programs.

Setting Its Sights On Larger Markets But educating the workforce of tomorrow through community colleges isn’t the only thing Amesite is doing with its advanced AI. The company’s infrastructure and capabilities in AI programming can be easily deployed to provide on-the-job apps for different industries, including healthcare – specifically, the 5.2 million nurses in the U.S. who could benefit from some AI technology.

In the spring, Amesite launched NurseMagic™, a proprietary AI app designed for nurses. With it, nurses can write nursing notes instantly, quickly translate medical terms into easy-to-understand language, create work emails, assist nurses in talking to patients with compassion, coach nurses on taking effective breaks during the day, provide key information about medications and collect instant feedback.

It makes sense that Amesite would want to set its sights on nurses. Despite the over five million of them in the workforce, America is facing a shortage that’s projected to grow, not to mention the high burnout rate for this profession. Introducing technology that makes their lives easier not only improves their careers but saves hospitals and healthcare systems money. After all, burnout can cost a hospital $16,736 per nurse per year through retention challenges, sick days and training new replacement nurses.

“Launching apps enables us to directly reach much larger audiences. We want to equip every nurse on the planet with tools that deliver immediate, qualified information and address the demands on their time while leveraging their expertise,” said Sastry at the time.

A Continued Focus On InnovationNot one to rest on its laurels, since rolling out NurseMagic, Amesite has been adding to the app’s capabilities, working hard to ensure it maintains its competitive lead and becomes the leading app for nurses. Some of those enhancements include the ability to build and update a resume, write cover letters for job applications, create text that improves a nurse’s social profile on LinkedIn and other sites and create replies to employers that highlight the applicant’s strengths. With those enhancements, Amesite says it’s helping the 35% of nurses who indicate they may look for a new job in the next year.

The app is also capable of creating nursing notes, a requirement for professionals ranging from CNAs and LPNs to APRN-CNPs and NPs which Amesite says takes up 40% of nurses’ time. The company also recently added the ability to upload and store study materials – including pdfs and video and audio files – to instantly create transcripts, summaries and even quizzes and flashcards, based on the material.

Proof Is In The Accuracy All these enhancements to NurseMagic are only as good as the AI behind it and Amesite has that covered as well. The company reports the foundational model that powers NurseMagic achieved a 93% accuracy rate when tested with questions from two leading NCLEX prep providers’ test banks. The NCLEX exam is a standardized exam developed by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) that nursing graduates must pass to obtain their nursing licenses in the United States and Canada. Accuracy is essential for the growing number of nurses using the app.

In June, the app was released in beta. Within a week of the release, close to 1,200 individuals completed an onboarding survey and registered as users of NurseMagic. Since then, usage has continued to gain momentum. At last check, NurseMagic has users from all 50 U.S. states and six nations. User growth continued to expand rapidly after launch, up 830% month-over-month from June to July. It also has the support of some popular influencers in the nursing community, including Paige Slayton, a nurse influencer engaged by Amesite, with over 900,000 followers.

"This is the fastest growth in usership that we have ever seen with any of our products,” said Sastry. “We are excited to be delivering a vital and useful tool to the largest segment of healthcare professionals and believe that NurseMagicTM will create a positive impact in healthcare and strong, sustainable revenue growth for Amesite."

From education to healthcare, Amesite's AI-powered learning platform is empowering countless people and making professionals’ lives much easier. With a model that can be replicated for different industries and markets, Amesite is carving out its path to stand out in the AI-powered learning of tomorrow.
