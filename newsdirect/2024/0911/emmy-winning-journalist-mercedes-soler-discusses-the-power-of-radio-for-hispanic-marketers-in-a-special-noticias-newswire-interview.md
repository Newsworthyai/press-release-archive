As Hispanic Heritage Month kicks off, Noticias Newswire is proud to present an exclusive, documentary-style interview with Emmy Award-winning journalist Mercedes Soler. In this in-depth conversation, Soler shares her insights on why radio remains one of the most powerful media for reaching and engaging Hispanic audiences—a timely discussion during this month celebrating the achievements and contributions of the Hispanic community.

In this exclusive interview, Bill Gato, CEO of Noticias Newswire and co-editor of Hispanic PR Blog, speaks with Soler about her journey from broadcast journalism to radio entrepreneurship. Together with her husband, Tomás Martínez, Soler co-founded Solmart Media in 2014, a network of seven Spanish-language radio stations that serve Southwest and Central Florida, reaching over 1.5 million listeners.

A career in media: From TV to radio pioneer

Soler rose to prominence as a founding anchor of Univision’s groundbreaking news show, Primer Impacto, where she spent two decades delivering hard-hitting journalism. She later transitioned to CNN en Español, further solidifying her reputation as one of the most trusted names in Spanish-language television. Today, Soler continues to blaze trails as a radio entrepreneur with Solmart Media, where she and her husband are dedicated to connecting with the growing Hispanic market through the power of radio.

Not your typical talking-head video

This 54-minute interview is more than just a standard Zoom-style chat. The documentary-style production includes dynamic b-roll footage, featuring photos, videos, maps, and animations that vividly illustrate Soler’s insights. From exploring radio’s resilience in the digital age to highlighting the unique community engagement that radio offers, these visual elements create an immersive experience for viewers.

According to Nielsen, 97% of U.S. Hispanics still tune into radio on a monthly basis—making it the most widely consumed media among this demographic, surpassing even TV and digital platforms.

“There’s no other media that people go back to, that people trust, that holds your hand, that becomes your friend on a daily basis, like radio,” Soler says. “Not television, not cable, not streaming, not phone, not Spotify, not social media. Radio is not only not dead. Radio is the strongest force in media today.”

Perfect timing for Hispanic Heritage Month

As marketers and PR professionals look for ways to connect with the rapidly growing Hispanic market, this interview offers a timely reminder of radio’s enduring cultural relevance. Hispanic Heritage Month celebrates the rich history, culture, and contributions of Hispanics in the U.S., and Soler’s story—of entrepreneurship, media innovation, and cultural leadership—embodies that spirit.

Key takeaways for PR pros and marketers:

* The surprising ways radio outpaces other media in reaching Hispanic audiences.
* How Soler and her husband built Solmart Media from the ground up to serve the Southwest and Central Florida Hispanic communities.
* Why understanding the Regional Mexican music format is key for marketers targeting U.S. Hispanics.
* How press releases and authentic media pitches still play a role in Hispanic radio.
