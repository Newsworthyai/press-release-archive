# Now Four Years In, Here's How News Direct Leapfrogged the Legacy Newswire Industry

![](https://public.newsdirect.com/676742291/LBzzVOAv.jpg)

In business parlance, the term “Leapfrog” refers to “a strategy that involves making a significant change or innovation that goes beyond what is expected or incremental. The goal is to improve a position by either skipping stages or taking an alternative path to achieve a desired outcome”*.

*Google AI Overview

News Direct represents the latter of those two paths.

Founded in 2020 by former Business Wire president, Gregg Castano, and owing to his 32+ year career with the Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary, News Direct enjoyed a head start unlike most other “challengers” to the established newswire industry order that also includes PR Newswire and Globe Newswire.

Castano leveraged the vast industry knowledge and expertise accumulated across those three plus decades and combined it with a forward-looking vision brought to life with a state-of-the-art, custom-written tech stack sitting atop a cloud infrastructure. The result is what can best be described as a “Next-Gen” news and content distribution platform ideally suited for a 21st-Century communications ecosystem.

News Direct has either vastly improved or completely replaced virtually everything about the legacy newswire model, which Castano believed needed to more strongly embrace and adopt the leading-edge digital technologies that enable the user experience to be modernized and enriched. The features and functions of News Direct are in many ways unrecognizable from traditional wires, with the notable exception of their comprehensive distribution footprint, which is identical to the “Big 3”.

Castano stated, “I felt strongly that for the newswire model to be sustainable, remain relevant and to grow, it needed to evolve. But more quickly than the classic interpretation of evolution, which suggests a slow, steady pace. Rapid evolution, I suppose, is what I envisioned, although at some point that becomes revolution. That’s a term I hesitate to use because it’s a bit shopworn and can seem hyperbolic, but there is no doubt that News Direct has changed the game in a big way.”

Among the ways in which News Direct has upended and disrupted the traditional newswire model, highlights include:

Cutting-Edge Technology: News Direct is built atop a modern, digital cloud infrastructure with a software stack custom-written to precise specifications that perfectly align with today’s communications landscape.

Direct-to-SEO Optimization: The platform is engineered to automatically enhance news releases for search engines, ensuring greater visibility and reach.

Multimedia Integration: Videos, images, and other rich media are easily incorporated into news releases to stimulate greater engagement – or can be sent as independent assets, no release required. This is a feature unique to the industry.

User-Friendly Interface: The workflow is intuitive and designed for speed, efficiency and seamless collaboration, allowing users to create, review and distribute releases in minutes, rather than waiting for remote editors to “process” content.

Greater Control and Flexibility: With News Direct, the user maintains complete control over their content throughout the distribution workflow. With no “middleman” editors, the distribution process can be directly managed end-to-end, ensuring that the news reaches the target audience without unnecessary delays, or the security risks of relying on intermediaries.

Real-Time Analytics: Customers get instant insights into how their news is performing with real-time analytics that are retrievable on-demand from within the customer interface.

Transparent, Cost-Effective Pricing: News Direct offers straightforward flat-rates with no word count limits, no fluctuating, geographically tiered pricing and no opaque hidden upcharges for things such as logos or trade media. Customers know exactly what they’re paying with a pricing model designed to be highly cost-effective and flat rates that make budgeting simple, easy and transparent, a particular advantage for high frequency users.

No Distribution Trade-Offs: The News Direct distribution network is identical to that of legacy services, providing a superior user-experience without sacrificing comprehensive reach.

Leadership and Industry Expertise: Founder and CEO Castano’s deep understanding of the market and vision for the future of news distribution that has been gained over a 40-year career is embedded into every aspect of News Direct. This wealth of expertise uniquely positions News Direct to meet the needs of modern communicators.

News Direct was designed to be thoroughly modern, streamlined and user-friendly, offering unprecedented value, flexibility, and efficiency. The company is committed to helping communications professionals achieve their media outreach goals by meeting the demands they face in today’s fast-paced digital environment.
