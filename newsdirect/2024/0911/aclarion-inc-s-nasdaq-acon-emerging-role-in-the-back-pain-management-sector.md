# Aclarion, Inc.’s (NASDAQ: ACON) Emerging Role in the Back Pain Management Sector

As the healthcare technology sector advances, companies are making significant strides in addressing widespread health challenges. One area experiencing notable innovation is the diagnosis and management of chronic low back pain (cLBP), a condition that affects millions globally and incurs substantial healthcare costs. Aclarion, Inc. (NASDAQ: ACON) is emerging as a key player in this field with its groundbreaking Nociscan platform.

Nociscan is an advanced diagnostic tool designed to address the global challenge of chronic low back pain, which impacts approximately 266 million people worldwide. This condition is a major driver of healthcare expenditures, with U.S. costs alone reaching up to $134.5 billion annually. Aclarion’s Nociscan platform stands out as the first evidence-supported software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution that uses Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (MRS), proprietary signal processing techniques, and augmented intelligence algorithms to noninvasively differentiate between painful and nonpainful discs in the lumbar spine.

The Nociscan system operates through a cloud-based platform that processes MRI data to quantify chemical biomarkers associated with disc pain. This data is then analyzed using proprietary algorithms to provide physicians with crucial insights into the potential sources of pain. By integrating Nociscan with traditional diagnostic methods, healthcare providers can achieve greater diagnostic precision and enhance treatment planning, leading to improved patient care.

Aclarion, Inc. (NASDAQ: ACON) has recently achieved a significant milestone with its Nociscan platform, announcing the completion of the first Nociscan exams in the LIFEHAB trial. This randomized control trial, conducted in Norway, is pivotal in comparing lumbar interbody fusion surgery with multidisciplinary rehabilitation for chronic low back pain. The trial involves 202 patients and utilized Nociscan’s advanced diagnostic technology to assess how MRS biomarkers can correlate with treatment responses.

The LIFEHAB trial began enrollment in Q2 of 2024, and as of late August, six patients have completed their Nociscan exams. Brett Ness, Aclarion’s CEO, highlighted the significance of this development: ““We are excited to see the LIFEHAB Trial progressing on schedule and look forward to the results of the study and to the role we expect Nociscan data to play in not only helping physicians determine which discs to treat but in potentially helping to predict which treatment option is optimal for a particular patient.”

This latest achievement showcases ACON’s commitment to advancing chronic low back pain management and demonstrates the growing adoption of Nociscan in research settings. The LIFEHAB trial’s integrations of Nociscan tech represent a crucial step in validating its effectiveness and aligning with Aclarions broader goals of enhaving treatment and outcomes.

As ACON continues to make strides, the company has also expended presence in the US market. On August 14, 2024, the company announced a key commercial agreement with Sheridan Community Hospital in Michigan. This partnership marks Aclarion’s entry into central Michigan and involves collaboration with Dr. John Keller, a leading neurosurgeon. This agreement aims to further validate Nociscan’s clinical effectiveness and demonstrates the platform's potential to advance noninvasive, cost-effective diagnostics for disc pain.

Building on its success in the UK, where ACON has secured insurance coverage, the company is now focused on achieving similar coverage in the U.S. This is a critical step towards increasing Nociscan’s accessibility and adoption within the American healthcare system.

Further expanding its reach, ACON has introduced Nociscan to the personal injury and workers’ compensation markets in New Jersey. Announced on August 29, 2024, this initiative involves Dr. Justin Kubeck, an orthopedic spine surgeon, working to enhance the evaluation of chronic low back pain in these complex legal and insurance settings. This effort aims to provide objective data to support treatment decisions and compensation claims, leveraging Nociscan’s ability to measure biomarkers correlated with pain and structural integrity.

In addition to its commercial agreements, Aclarion has launched two major clinical trials to substantiate Nociscan’s benefits. The Clinical Utility and Economic (CLUE) Trial, announced on August 21, 2024, aims to assess how Nociscan’s AI-generated biomarker data impacts surgical treatment decisions. By comparing surgeons’ initial treatment plans with those adjusted after reviewing Nociscan data, the trial seeks to provide valuable real-world evidence of the platform’s effectiveness in improving surgical outcomes. Complementing this, the CLARITY trial—a gold-standard, multicenter, prospective randomized study—will provide definitive evidence on the advantages of incorporating Nociscan data into surgical decision-making processes.

Aclarion’s innovative approach has recently garnered industry recognition. On September 5, 2024, ACON was added to the PRISM Emerging Medical Devices Index. This inclusion highlights Aclarion’s position as a leading innovator in the medtech sector. Being part of the PRISM Index validates Aclarion’s technological advancements and can increase its market visibility, credibility, and attractiveness to investors. As the U.S. medical devices market is projected to grow to nearly $315 billion by 2032, Aclarion’s Nociscan is well-positioned to capture a portion of the $40 billion lumbar spine diagnostics and treatment market.

ACON’s efforts to address chronic low back pain through innovative, noninvasive technology underscore its potential to make a significant impact in the healthcare sector. With its expanding clinical partnerships, ongoing trials, and recent industry recognition, ACON is positioning itself strongly within the healthcare technology market.
