# Med-X Poised for Global Expansion and NASDAQ Listing Amidst 200% Revenue Growth

Med-X, the parent company of Nature-Cide, Malibu Brands, and Thermal-Aid – leading natural pesticide and pain-management brands, respectively – is planning a NASDAQ listing in the near future. But they’re offering private investors an opportunity to join them before it happens.

More than just a pest control and health & wellness product developer, Med-X has an entire portfolio of green products aiming to supply natural solutions that reduce health risks and minimize harm to the environment. The company's flagship brand, Nature-Cide, has gained widespread acclaim for its effectiveness in pest management without the harmful effects of traditional chemical pesticides.

While they’ve achieved a remarkable 200% revenue growth in the last few years, Med-X is just getting started. Their e-commerce relationships with retail giants Walmart, Kroger and Amazon, are amplifying the company’s market reach, providing consumers across the United States with access to eco-friendly alternatives.

Even beyond the United States, Med-X has secured exclusive agreements with international distributors. These include landmark deals with Ensystex to introduce Nature-Cide products in 41 new markets spanning Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, Africa, and the Middle East. This expansion not only addresses growing global demand for sustainable pest control solutions but also positions Med-X at the forefront of the $17.6 billion biopesticides market.

Med-X has already acquired the ticker “MXRX” for their planned NASDAQ listing. Since going public could present an opportunity for higher visibility for the brand and possible greater liquidity for investors, it makes their private investment opportunity all the more timely.
