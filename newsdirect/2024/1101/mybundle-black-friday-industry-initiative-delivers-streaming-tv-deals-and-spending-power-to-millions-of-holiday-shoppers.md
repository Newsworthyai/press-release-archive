# MYBUNDLE BLACK FRIDAY INDUSTRY INITIATIVE DELIVERS STREAMING TV DEALS AND SPENDING POWER TO MILLIONS OF HOLIDAY SHOPPERS

MyBundle, the leading platform connecting consumers, streaming services and broadband providers with tools to simplify streaming television, shared details of a new Black Friday industry program.

The program leverages MyBundle’s unique channel of big and small broadband provider partners around the country to give streaming services and their Black Friday deals unprecedented exposure and context.

MyBundle partners with a growing network of more than 270 broadband providers that collectively serve more than 13.5 million internet customers. These customers look to their broadband providers for guidance on streaming TV services and often, free credits toward streaming TV bundled with their internet service. In turn, broadband providers look to MyBundle to provide marketing resources, expertise and a vehicle for providing those credits.

The MyBundle Black Friday program capitalizes on these relationships with two key components.

First, MyBundle will publish all Black Friday streaming deals the moment they go live at mybundle.tv/pages/black-friday, which instantly syndicates across the sites of the MyBundle broadband partner network.

Second, MyBundle is giving those partners everything they need - from marketing materials to customer emails to a co-branded site where customers receive their MyBundle streaming payment cards - to offer their own Black Friday streaming TV promotions. For example, order internet service and get $100 in streaming credits to spend on Black Friday deals or upgrade your internet service and get $15/month for the next six months.

“Consumers have long adopted Black Friday as the unofficial start of the holiday shopping period, and the streaming industry has jumped in with both feet. MyBundle believes it is the ideal time for folks to sign up for new services they have had their eyes on,” said MyBundle Co-Founder and CEO, Jason Cohen. “With this program, broadband providers get to leverage streaming deals to grow subscriber adds, upgrades and retention and to drive broadband revenue. Streamers get to leverage the broadband providers to get their deals in front of new customers. And customers get outstanding values on streaming deals, from a provider they trust, with subsidies to spend and a directory of where to spend it.”

Streaming services that want to be promoted to this base of millions of subsidized streamers should send the details of their Black Friday offer, including discounts and effective dates to blackfriday@mybundle.tv.
