# Mothers' Milk Bank California Launches Online Milk Drive for National Prematurity Awareness Month

What: In honor of Prematurity Awareness Month this November, Mothers' Milk Bank California is launching an Online Milk Drive to raise awareness about the vital role donor breast milk plays in saving the lives of premature and medically fragile infants. With over 380,000 babies born prematurely in the U.S. each year, the need for donated human milk is greater than ever. This drive aims to increase the number of breast milk donors while educating the public about the importance of donor milk for infants in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs).

When: November 1 – November 30, 2024

Where: Online or in-person at any of our 10 collection centers across California and Nevada.

Who: Mothers' Milk Bank California invites breastfeeding mothers, community members, and supporters across the country to join this critical initiative. The Online Milk Drive is open to anyone who wants to help make a difference, whether by donating milk online, dropping off milk at our collection centers, or spreading the word.

Why: Donor breast milk provides life-saving nutrients and immune support to premature and sick infants who are unable to receive their mother’s milk. It is a crucial alternative when a mother’s own milk is unavailable, reducing the risk of serious infections like necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and improving health outcomes for the most vulnerable babies. The goal of this drive is to ensure that no baby goes without the nourishment they need to survive and thrive.

 How to Participate:1. Breastfeeding mothers can sign up to become milk donors through our easy online application or drop off their milk at any of our 10 collection centers.
2. Community members can support the campaign by sharing it on social media and encouraging prospective milk donors to join the online drive.
3. Make a Monetary Donation: You can support us financially by donating online. Every contribution, no matter the size, helps cover the costs of processing and distributing donor milk to those in need

Founded 50 years ago, Mothers' Milk Bank California is a leading nonprofit dedicated to providing screened, donated human milk to babies in need. As a founding member of the Human Milk Banking Association of North America (HMBANA), it helped set standards for nonprofit milk banks across North America. The organization collects, pasteurizes, and distributes safe human milk to hospitals and families, ensuring essential nutrition for infants. Committed to improving lives, Mothersâ Milk Bank California supports families and advances neonatal care.
