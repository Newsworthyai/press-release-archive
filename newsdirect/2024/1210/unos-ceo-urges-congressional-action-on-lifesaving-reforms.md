# UNOS CEO Urges Congressional Action on Lifesaving Reforms

Maureen McBride, Ph.D., the CEO of the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), sent a letter to Congress requesting action on a slate of reforms to our nation’s organ donation and transplantation system that will remove barriers, increase efficiency, and reduce organ non-use to help save more lives.

The letter was sent to members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which has oversight authority of the national system. The letter is supported by nearly 70 members of the community, who signed on in solidarity.

The statutory and regulatory changes outlined in McBride’s letter are essential steps to strengthening the system. The proposals require federal action and are actions UNOS does not have the authority to take in its role as a contractor for the nation’s Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN).

As McBride wrote in her letter: “Although much of the donation and transplant system has been outside of the purview of UNOS’ service as the OPTN contractor, we are committed to strengthening the system for patients everywhere.”

McBride outlined four key proposals:

* Mandate automated donor referrals to optimize the donor referral process
* Mandate in-cabin airline transportation for organs
* Mandate organ tracking for unaccompanied organs
* Incentivize transplant hospitals to accept hard-to-place organs and reduce organ non-use

“These reforms will help save lives and make the donation and transplant system more efficient, which is why I’m joined by nearly 70 professionals from this community urging Congress to take action,” said McBride. “We fight on behalf of patients every day and are energized by Congress’ renewed focus on strengthening the system. Our proposed reforms capitalize on this opportunity to enact policy changes that will help more people get the lifesaving transplants they need.”

Data suggests that together, the reforms could result in an increase in both donor referrals and organ donors, a reduction in the number of organs lost, delayed or damaged in transit, and could reduce the number of people who die waiting for an organ transplant. Today, about 16 people die each day on the waitlist. If enacted, these proposals would lead to more organs being available for transplant, preventing an estimated 4,000 deaths each year.
