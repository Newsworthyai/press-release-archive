# Gordon Marketing Acquires SeniorHealthPro

Gordon Marketing, a national, independent, and family-owned field marketing organization (FMO) and an affiliate of AmeriLife Group, LLC (“AmeriLife”), announced today that it had acquired SeniorHealthPro Corporation (“SeniorHealthPro”), an independent marketing organization (IMO) and call center started by husband and wife team, Juan Carlos and Nohemi Mendez, focusing solely on Medicare Advantage products. Per the agreement, terms of the deal were not disclosed.

“We couldn’t be more thrilled to partner up with Juan, Nohemi, and the team,” said Rebecca Gordon, president of Gordon Marketing. “Their continued passion for serving the Hispanic senior market is unparalleled. Not only are they incredibly successful, but they are also kind people with integrity and a passion for the business. We are stronger together, and our future looks very bright!”

Motivated by the experience of caring for his parents and helping them navigate the complexities of Medicare, Juan Carlos launched his company to help other families gain the proper guidance to help their loved ones make essential healthcare and financial decisions.

“Our company was born from the love of family and the passion for helping others understand their options when making important health and financial decisions,” said Juan Carlos Mendez, owner and president of SeniorHealthPro. “That passion grew, and as we welcomed more employees and partnered with more insurance companies, it became clear that the next level of growth required deeper integration and innovation. AmeriLife’s focus on culture, best-in-class business environment, and extensive customer-centric distribution network was the best choice for us in the market.”

SeniorHealthPro has over 35 full-time employees and more than 60 agents licensed in nearly all 50 states, capturing leads through direct mail, social media, and radio advertising. With Gordon Marketing and AmeriLife, SeniorHealthPro will enjoy expanded access to tools and resources to boost its reach, productivity, and profitability.
