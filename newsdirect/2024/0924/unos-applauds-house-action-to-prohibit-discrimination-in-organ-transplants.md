“The U.S. organ transplant matching system was created 40 years ago to serve every patient in need, which is why we strongly believe no one should be denied placement on the national waitlist solely because of his or her disability.

We’re pleased to see the House pass this legislation, which advances our shared goal of ensuring equity for patients with disabilities in our nation’s donation and transplant system. Thank you, U.S. Reps. Kat Cammack and Debbie Dingell for your leadership. We look forward to continuing to work with you to ensure all Americans, regardless of their disability, have equitable access to organ transplants, and urge the U.S. Senate to quickly pass this legislation led by U.S. Sens. Marco Rubio and Maggie Hassan.”
