# Vertical IQ Selected as NC State Master of Science in Analytics Practicum Sponsor

Vertical IQ, a leader in Industry Intelligence, is proud to announce its selection as a sponsor of the Master of Science in Analytics (MSA) Practicum at North Carolina State University’s Institute for Advanced Analytics. This partnership will connect NC State MSA students with Vertical IQ’s team to collaborate on a range of data-driven projects that will contribute to the company’s ongoing commitment to real-time data and the support of aspiring data professionals.

Vertical IQ joins an impressive roster of 18 organizations sponsoring projects for the university’s MSA Class of 2025. As part of the collaboration, student teams will work with Vertical IQ to apply their advanced analytics skills to real-world challenges over the next eight months, all while gaining valuable hands-on experience in the Industry Intelligence space.

The MSA practicum, a core component of the MSA program at NC State, challenges students to solve real-world problems for sponsor organizations, helping them to develop critical skills in analytics, data science, and teamwork. Since 2007, over 150 organizations have participated in the practicum, providing students with invaluable experience in tackling complex, data-driven challenges.

“We are excited to support NC State’s MSA program and to provide students with the opportunity to collaborate on innovative projects that will ultimately benefit our Vertical IQ end users as well,” said Matt Redding, chief technology officer at Vertical IQ. “The practicum aligns perfectly with our mission to leverage data to empower businesses, and we’re thrilled to contribute to their professional development.”

This marks Vertical IQ’s first sponsorship of the MSA practicum, and the collaboration will focus on projects that sync with the company’s data-centric approach, driving new insights and opportunities for growth within its platform.
