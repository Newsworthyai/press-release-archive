# fpPathfinder Partners with MoneyTree Solutions to Create Knowledge Integration

fpPathfinder and Moneytree Solutions are excited to announce their Knowledge Integration partnership, bringing together their powerful tools to enhance the financial planning experience.

As part of this strategic collaboration, Moneytree Solutions' robust financial planning tools will be seamlessly integrated with fpPathfinder’s comprehensive checklists, flowcharts, and summary guides. These guides are designed to help advisors feel confident navigating complex planning concepts, ensuring they can provide precise and personalized advice to their clients.

The integration will exist in Moneytree’s new financial planning platform for Elite-package users. Elite is Moneytree’s most comprehensive package with both goal-based and cash-flow-based planning and a host of specialized planning tools that cover areas such as retirement distribution, tax planning, and estate planning.

“Unlike a traditional data integration which shares data between two tech companies, we have created a Knowledge Integration with Moneytree to share information to help explain planning concepts to the advisor and their client,” said Michael Lecours, fpPathfinder co-founder.

Patrick Spencer, Managing Director of Moneytree Solutions, added, “This partnership aligns perfectly with our commitment to give planners and advisors the engagement tools they need to build stronger client relationships founded on trust and understanding. fpPathfinder’s guides will provide users of the new Moneytree Elite platform with an invaluable resource to dig deeper into planning concepts and more easily help clients achieve their financial goals and lifestyle dreams.”

This partnership underscores both companies' dedication to helping advisors look and feel smarter while providing thoughtful, comprehensive financial advice.
