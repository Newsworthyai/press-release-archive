# HTX Unveils "Earn with Pending Orders" #2 with Upsized Rewards: Post BTC/USDT in Spot Trades to Split 32.2B $HTX

HTX’s "Earn with Pending Orders" event has garnered widespread praise and active participation since its debut on 26 June. HTX, in response to user feedback, has adjusted the event rules and is now launching the 2nd phase of "Earn with Pending Orders". Users can participate by posting BTC/USDT in spot trades to share in a prize pool of 32.2 billion $HTX, with rewards distributed around the clock.

New Feature: Enjoy Non-Stop Rewards with Minute-by-Minute Snapshots

Following "Trade to Earn," HTX launches "Earn with Pending Orders," another innovative product aimed at enriching users' trading experiences. According to HTX's official announcement, the 2nd phase of "Earn with Pending Orders" event will last from 10:00 (UTC) on July 10, 2024, to 10:00 (UTC) on July 17, 2024, featuring BTC/USDT as the designated spot trading pair. During the event period, the platform will take random snapshots of pending orders for BTC/USDT spot trades every minute. Based on these snapshots, the platform will calculate rewards separately for qualifying buy and sell orders. These rewards can be accumulated throughout the event. Pending orders are considered valid if they meet two requirements:

● Minimum order amount: Pending orders must be limit orders with a minimum amount of 100 USDT at the time of the snapshot, defined as order price * order quantity ≥ 100 USDT.

● Order price: The price of pending orders should not deviate by more than 0.5% from the latest executed price (closing price) at the time of the snapshot.

Here is an example. Let's assume the latest executed price (closing price) at the time of the snapshot for BTC/USDT is 60,000 USDT. The threshold range is ±0.5%. Therefore, the upper limit price for pending orders will be 60,300 USDT (calculated as 60,000 x 1.005), and the lower limit price will be 59,700 USDT (calculated as 60,000 x 0.995). Therefore, valid pending orders must have prices at the time of the snapshot between 59,700 USDT and 60,300 USDT (59,700 USDT < Pending order price < 60,300 USDT).

Optimized Rules: Now Open to API Users and Offer Upsized Rewards

In comparison to the initial phase of "Earn with Pending Orders", the second phase incorporates two major rule upgrades: API users are now eligible to participate in this event; and an extra prize pool has been included, boosting total rewards to 32.2 billion $HTX. Details are stated below:

● Reward 1: Post BTC Orders and Split 27.2 Billion $HTX

The event boasts a total prize pool of 27,200,000,000 $HTX, with a daily prize pool of 3,885,714,285 $HTX, and a per-minute prize pool of 2,698,412 $HTX. All valid pending orders are eligible for this reward. Every minute, users will share the prize pool proportionally based on the order amounts of their pending orders.

A user's reward per minute for pending orders = Reward pool per minute * (User's pending order amount / Total amount of all valid pending orders). For example: Let's assume that, in a specific minute, the total amount of all eligible pending orders is 1000 USDT, and User A has a pending order amounting to 100 USDT. According to the provided reward calculation formula, User A's reward can be calculated as 2,698,412 $HTX * (100/1000). Therefore, User A would receive a reward of 269,841.2 $HTX for that minute.

● Reward 2: Users with Pending Orders Falling within the ±0.1% Threshold Range to Share Extra 5 Billion $HTX

Based on the aforementioned reward rules, during each snapshot, users with pending orders within the ±0.1% threshold range of the buy and sell prices will be eligible to share an extra prize pool. The extra prize pool totals 5,000,000,000 $HTX, with daily distributions of 714,285,714 $HTX and minute-by-minute allocations of 496,032 $HTX. The distribution of the prize pool remains consistent with the rules stated above.

Please note that users need to click "Register Now" in the announcement to participate in the event. The hourly reward cap for each participant in this event is 90,909,090 $HTX. A participant will not receive any more rewards if either the hourly reward cap for the participant or the hourly prize pool limit is reached.
