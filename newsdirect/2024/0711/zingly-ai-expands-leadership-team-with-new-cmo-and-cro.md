# Zingly.ai Expands Leadership Team with New CMO and CRO

Zingly.ai, a leading innovator in AI-powered customer experience solutions, recognized as one of the Top Ten Contact Center Technologies of 2024, announced today the expansion of its leadership team with the appointment of Pat Oldenburg as Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) and Gary Chan as Chief Revenue Officer (CRO). This strategic expansion aims to further strengthen Zingly.ai’s market presence and accelerate its growth trajectory.

“The last two decades were about cloud technologies and agent facing solutions. The next two will be about customer facing CX and AI experiences, and for these two things we need true innovation with real ROI on AI investments.” said Gaurav Passi, CEO of Zingly.ai. “Gary's experience has given him an invaluable understanding of the digital experience needs from top financial companies. Pat brings a wealth of knowledge in CX and AI trends across industries from his time at Five9 and Motive, and a customer-centric mindset in his approach to marketing.Their collective expertise will be crucial as we continue to expand our market presence and redefine the customer experience landscape, in our mission to make CX truly collaborative.”

Gary Chan joins Zingly.ai as Chief Revenue Officer, bringing over 12 years of leadership experience in financial services and SaaS sales. Prior to Zingly, Gary was most recently Head of Sales at EasySend. Prior to that, he was a founding sales leader at Glia, where he pioneered Digital Customer Service for financial institutions. In his new role, Gary will oversee go-to-market (GTM) and sales strategy, customer and partner development, and market expansion. Gary has already begun to assemble a high-performing revenue operations team, focusing on scaling sales processes, enhancing customer relationships, and identifying new market opportunities.

"With the imbalance of agents and consumers, and the added cost and inflation pressure we are experiencing today, businesses need to fundamentally rethink customer service, and acquisition. The Zingly solution is a transformational rethinking of traditional Contact Center approaches and I couldn’t be more excited to partner with our current and future clients to build relationships bigger than business," said Gary Chan.

Pat Oldenburg joins Zingly.ai as Chief Marketing Officer, bringing over 20 years of experience in enterprise and cloud software marketing. In his role, Pat will lead all aspects of marketing strategy and execution, helping the company accelerate its CX category leadership. His dynamic leadership ensures that Zingly.ai's groundbreaking relationship-building tools resonate and thrive in the global market. Pat has been actively building a dynamic marketing team, dedicated to leveraging innovative CX and AI strategies to strengthen the brand, market expansion, GTM strategies and enhance customer experiences.

Pat joins the Zingly team from Motive, where he served as VP of Global Demand Generation. He has also held leadership roles in digital marketing, operations, content, and customer marketing at ServiceMax, Five9, McAfee, and EMC Corporation.

"With the shift in customer behavior from traditional, siloed channels like 1800 numbers to digital platforms, coupled with rapid advancements in generative AI, there is an urgent need to rethink customer experience strategies within relationship-centric organizations. With visionary CEO Gaurav Passi, as well as industry leaders and veterans from Five9, Talkdesk, and Glia, and more, we have a massive opportunity to help bring collaboration to the forefront of the CX landscape. I look forward to partnering with the team to drive demand, strengthen customer connections, and discover new avenues for growth and success," said Pat Oldenburg.
