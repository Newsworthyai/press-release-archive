APRU is deeply grateful to its loyal shareholders for their patience and support as the company works tirelessly to build a brand that is both economically viable and sustainable for the future. Apple Rush Company is proud to announce a significant milestone: the expansion of its production facilities at Lena Brewing by over four thousand square feet. Along with this expansion, the company is investing in the necessary equipment to meet market demands and increase its production capacity fivefold. This development marks a crucial step in our journey toward growth and success.

Ross Vehmeier, President of Lena Brewing, commented, “With the expansion of the production area by over 4,000 square feet, we will be able to deliver results for our customers that will drive shareholder value. Efficiency will increase by providing staging, storage, and production space for workflow. This is the second phase of our planned expansion that we undertook in 2023 and will be followed up with additional expansion over the coming months.”

CEO of APRU, Tony Torgerud, states, “I am elated to share that this expansion of production will allow us to meet the demands that we have encountered in this market.” He goes on to say, “We will now have the ability to produce up to a million cans per month. This advancement in operations now puts us in a position for tremendous revenue growth and further acquisitions.”
