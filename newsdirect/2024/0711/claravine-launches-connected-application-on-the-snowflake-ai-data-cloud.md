# Claravine Launches Connected Application on the Snowflake AI Data Cloud

Claravine, The Data Standards Company, today announced the launch of a connected application Powered by Snowflake, connecting The Data Standards Cloud to the Snowflake AI Data Cloud. Organizations and marketers can now manage and mobilize their data faster and more efficiently, gaining intelligence and proving the business value of marketing campaigns.

By leveraging the Snowflake AI Data Cloud, Claravine's connected application dramatically reduces manual data preparation tasks, breaks down data silos and accelerates both data availability and quality. Claravine provides a marketing data foundation, standardizing metadata within Snowflake, to streamline efforts across the marketing organization, many of which have the potential to impact AI initiatives, including AI use cases such as propensity scoring, personalization, prescriptive email content, and customer support co-pilots. Claravine's solution allows Snowflake customers to access dimension table management and enables seamless integration of creative metadata from a Digital Asset Management (DAM) system into media campaigns, providing a comprehensive data ecosystem.

"Today marks an important step in our partnership with Claravine," said Jim Warner, Global Field CTO for Advertising & Marketing, Snowflake. "The new connected application enables joint customers to pass standardized marketing metadata directly into Snowflake to power campaign intelligence. With Claravine and Snowflake, marketers can make more confident, data-driven decisions that drive their business forward."

In the dynamic and highly competitive marketing environment, marketers must have a comprehensive understanding of their performance metrics. Yet, marketers are confronted by a multitude of channels and data silos, diminishing marketing budgets and the acceleration of campaign and creative output. This creates a complex and financially demanding challenge. Claravine and Snowflake can assist their joint customers by delivering a solid infrastructure for marketing data.

“Launching The Data Standards Cloud and Snowflake AI Data Cloud integration is a game-changer for our joint clients and their marketing teams,” said Chris Comstock, Chief Growth Officer, Claravine. “This connected application streamlines marketing data management – reducing errors in data preparation and providing a reliable source of marketing metadata. As more customers centralize their core data infrastructure on Snowflake we believe metadata is an essential component to a successful data strategy."
