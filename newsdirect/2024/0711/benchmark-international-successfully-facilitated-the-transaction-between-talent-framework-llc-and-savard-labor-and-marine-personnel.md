Benchmark International is pleased to announce the transaction between Talent Framework, LLC and Savard Labor and Marine Personnel.

Talent Framework is a full-service staffing agency specializing in temporary and permanent hourly personnel, primarily for the industrial, professional, and medical sectors. The company's excellent reputation has been instrumental in creating a long-standing repeat client base.

Savard Labor and Marine is a personnel and contract labor agency that specializes in providing its clients with skilled and unskilled blue-collar labor. Unlike agencies that promise too much and rarely deliver, Savard has a proven track record of increasing client efficiency and reducing labor costs by providing highly screened, safety-conscious personnel.

"For 20+ years, Steve built Talent Framework into a local leader in the staffing industry. This strategic acquisition will give Savard an opportunity to expand operations in a new geographic market and capitalize on Talent Framework's stellar reputation in the area. This is a great match between two great companies." - Kevin Barrett, Transaction Director, Benchmark International
