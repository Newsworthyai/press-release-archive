# Cure Alzheimer’s Fund Announces 19th Straight Year 
of Record Results

Cure Alzheimer’s Fund has announced that 2023 marked its 19th consecutive year of record-breaking results for contributions raised to fund research into Alzheimer’s disease. A total of $34.8 million for the year represented an increase of more than 8% from 2022 in funds received through more than 22,000 generous gifts. In 2023, 114 research grants representing $27.8 million were issued to 147 scientists in 11 countries, the most ever in a single year.

“Cure Alzheimer’s Fund exists to fund research that will end the burden of Alzheimer’s disease, and we are proud that in 2023 we supported more projects than ever before in our history. Our research, fundraising and all other activities are detailed with full transparency in our annual report,” said Meg Smith, CEO of Cure Alzheimer’s Fund. “New drugs to treat early-stage Alzheimer’s patients demonstrate the power of scientific perseverance and bring hope to our community. However, 6.9 million Americans are living with an Alzheimer’s diagnosis—and there are still no disease-altering treatments for most of them. More and better answers are needed to prevent the expected doubling of this patient population by 2050. We celebrate the progress that has been made and we stay determined to accelerate the progress necessary to benefit everyone at risk of, or living with, Alzheimer’s disease.”

The 2023 Annual Report detailing the financial results and research investments is now available in the reports section of the Cure Alzheimer’s Fund website, CureAlz.org, or through this link: bit.ly/CureAlz2023AReport
