Innovation is occurring everywhere, even with the walkie-talkie, more formally known as a handheld transceiver. Recently, Siyata Mobile (NASDAQ: SYTA), a global developer and vendor of Push-to-Talk over Cellular handsets and accessories, announced that the Zello push-to-talk (PTT) application is now available on Siyata’s SD7 push-to-talk handset.

Siyata Mobile Inc. is disrupting a legacy, multi-billion-dollar two-way radio market, and this strategic initiative with Zello elevates the firm’s competitive position and strengthens its value proposition in the minds of its existing customers as well as potential prospects.

Founded in 2012 and headquartered in Canada, Siyata Mobile Inc. aims to be the global leader in the growing Push-to-Talk over Cellular industry by disrupting the legacy Land Mobile Radio (LMR) Industry with next-generation communication technology. The firm has gained prominence as a developer and provider of technologically advanced rugged smartphones, in-vehicle mounted cellular communications devices and cellular signal boosters. Siyata has customers throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia and the Middle East.

The Growing Push-To-Talk Over Cellular MarketAs the name suggests, Push-to-Talk over Cellular uses mobile networks to relay communications to another handset. It supports all the advanced features of digital mobile radios and combines them with 4G or 5G bandwidth and nationwide coverage. Research published by Allied Market Research valued the Push-to-Talk over Cellular market at $3.43 billion in 2019 and projects it to reach $6.95 billion by 2027. Compared to LMR, Push-to-Talk over Cellular handsets work virtually anywhere on cellular networks, support third-party data applications and are less capital intensive for customers, as they have a lower price point and do not require investment in tower sites.

Siyata Mobile’s Strategic InitiativesFor the fiscal year 2023, Siyata Mobile’s reported revenue and gross profit were $8.23 million and $2.66 million, respectively, an increase of 27.0% and 91.2% from the previous year. Regarding the firm’s business model, Siyata Mobile markets its devices with leading cellular carriers and their distributors, who sell them to enterprise customers. Leveraging these carrier sales channels and their broad customer base with Siyata Mobile’s product portfolio means the firm can maintain a lean operating cost structure. Siyata Mobile gives carriers the ability to activate a SIM card and generate income otherwise not captured with customers who use LMR.

Siyata Mobile’s integration with the Zello push-to-talk application is a strategic initiative that elevates the value proposition of the firm’s product offering. Zello is a live voice push-to-talk communication platform that turns any smart device into a digital two-way radio that works over Wi-Fi and cellular networks anywhere in the world. Purpose-built to connect frontline teams and communities, the push-to-talk walkie-talkie app offers instant voice communication with one or many in unlimited secure, private channels, as well as message replay, emergency alerts, location tracking, dispatch capabilities and Bluetooth device support.

As one of the world’s most popular Push-to-Talk applications with more than 175 million users registered worldwide and 99.99% uptime, Zello is simple to use and easily connects frontline and operations teams with a platform that is easy to use. In speaking about Zello's integration with Siyata Mobile, Public safety customer Evan Shegoski from River Road Rescue Squad in New Jersey commented, “We are enthused to be able to deploy the feature-rich Zello for Business solution on our SD7 devices. We have long been a proponent of this combined solution which pairs this leading PTT platform with offerings directly comparable to the same features we expect from a traditional LMR solution accessible through the only device on the market that not only acts like a traditional LMR radio, but is also receives regular product development, improvement, and support. This combined solution offers promise as a scalable solution across multiple geographic regions with a truly reasonable price point for deployment in terms of end-user device, LMR integrations and PTT network. Siyata and Zello together breaks us free of the bloated costs and bureaucracy that routinely plagues LMR public safety solutions. We cannot wait to see what the future holds as this offering continues to be developed.”

Lieutenant Brian Hess of Westchester County Police – which recently purchased several hundred Siyata SD7 handsets for use with Zello for operations throughout the county – added a further endorsement, stating, “We are pleased that the Siyata SD7 is available with Zello PTT since this handset is what our county needs to keep in touch effectively to provide the level of service that the residents of the County require.”

The Path ForwardAs a business-to-business global developer and vendor of next-generation Push-To-Talk over Cellular handsets and accessories, Siyata Mobile continually seeks to enhance the utility it provides to its customers, which includes police, fire and ambulance organizations as well as schools, utilities, security companies, hospitals, waste management companies, resorts and many other organizations. The firm’s strategic integration of the Zello application within the SD7 Handset bolsters the usefulness and capability of the product for the individuals that protect, serve and maintain the well-being of our society.
