Knightscope, Inc. (NASDAQ:KSCP), a leading Silicon Valley-based AI and security tech innovator, has once again secured the trust of Huntington Park Police Department, renewing its contract for the sixth consecutive year. This extension ensures that the K5 Autonomous Security Robot (ASR) will continue its crucial role in safeguarding Salt Lake Park, a move that has already led to a significant reduction in crime and enhanced public safety.

Knightscope, which is known for its cutting-edge autonomous security robots (ASRs) and blue light emergency communication systems, creates technology that deters, detects, and reports incidents in real time. These robots are more than just gadgets; they represent a new frontier in crime prevention, offering security professionals unparalleled situational awareness.

With their cost-effective deployment, Knightscope’s robots are protecting various environments across the country, from workplaces and schools to parks and public spaces. The company's overarching mission is to transform the United States into the safest country in the world.

Huntington Park Police Chief Cosme Lozano expressed his enthusiasm about the continued collaboration, stating, “The integration of the K5 ASR into our city resources has been transformative. It has greatly improved our capacity to monitor public spaces, boost public safety, and enhance the overall perception of our community.”

The impact of the K5 ASR has been nothing short of remarkable. Since its deployment, the robot has played a key role in reducing crime and nuisance activities at Salt Lake Park. According to the city manager, the presence of the K5 ASR led to a 10% reduction in service calls and a staggering 46% decrease in crime reports during its initial year of operation. These figures underscore the effectiveness of Knightscope’s technology in fostering a safer environment for the community.

Knightscope also upgraded the Huntington Park Police Department to the fifth-generation K5 Autonomous Security Robot (ASR) at no extra cost, further enhancing its capabilities in safeguarding Salt Lake Park and continuing its impressive track record of reducing crime and boosting public safety.1

The upgraded fifth-generation K5 Autonomous Security Robot features a wider stance for better stability, a raised camera for near eye-level 4K video capture, improved battery architecture, enhanced audio, additional lighting for better nighttime visibility, and a design optimized for easier maintenance. These improvements enhance its effectiveness and operational reliability.2

William Santana Li, Chairman and CEO of Knightscope, emphasized the importance of equipping law enforcement with advanced tools, stating, “Our law enforcement officers deserve the utmost respect for their dedication and the best tools available to support their mission. We are honored to continue our partnership for another year, helping to protect the places where people live, work, study, and visit.”

The K5 ASR, a cornerstone of Knightscope’s technology suite, is not just making waves in Huntington Park. It’s also gaining widespread recognition in the tech world. Recently, Citi featured the K5 robot in its influential report titled "The Rise of AI Robots," positioning it alongside Boston Dynamics' Spot robot and Tesla's Optimus.3 This acknowledgment underscores the growing impact of Knightscope’s innovations and highlights the K5’s role in advancing security technology.

Knightscope Expands Contracts with Schools, Transit Agencies, and University of TexasThe recent extension with the police department is just the tip of the iceberg. Knightscope, Inc. (NASDAQ:KSCP) has achieved significant contract expansions with a diverse range of clients, including schools, transit agencies, multifamily communities, and universities, highlighting the growing confidence in its security technologies.

Last month, the company renewed and expanded its contracts with several school districts and transit agencies. The enhanced agreements will see the deployment of Knightscope's K5 Autonomous Security Robots (ASRs) to patrol and monitor public spaces, offering real-time incident detection and reporting to boost safety.

The University of Texas has increased its use of Knightscope's emergency communication systems, a move aimed at bolstering the university’s preparedness and response capabilities during emergencies.

In California, a multifamily community has expanded its contract with Knightscope to include more K5 ASRs. This expansion will enhance security and improve safety for residents through continuous monitoring and prompt incident reporting.

Additionally, two other universities have extended their contracts with Knightscope, incorporating more of its security solutions to further strengthen campus security and create a safer environment for students and staff.

These expansions reflect Knightscope’s growing impact and its commitment to improving safety and security across a variety of sectors and locations.
