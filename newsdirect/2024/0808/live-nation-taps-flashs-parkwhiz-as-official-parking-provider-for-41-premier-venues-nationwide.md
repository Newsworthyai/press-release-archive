# Live Nation Taps Flash’s ParkWhiz As Official Parking Provider for 41 Premier Venues Nationwide

Flash, the leading end-to-end parking technology platform, today announced a multi-year partnership with Live Nation Entertainment that makes Flash’s ParkWhiz platform the official parking provider for 41 Live Nation clubs, concert halls, theaters and House of Blues venues in city centers across the country. With Flash’s ParkWhiz solution, Live Nation guests can book and prepay for parking online when they buy tickets, or any time before the show, at multiple nearby locations.

“Live Nation has incredible venues at prime locations that, by virtue of their dense urban surroundings, can make parking a challenging experience for fans,” said Ryan Kern, Flash Vice President and General Manager of Events. “We're making sure parking doesn’t get in the way of fans who are eager to get in the doors.”

Live Nation ticket buyers will first see the option to buy a parking pass at checkout for their ticket purchases. They will also see parking options on the “Plan Your Visit” section of the venue website and in event reminder emails right up to the event date. Eliminating the guesswork, stress and time from planning their parking gives guests a better show-going experience.

The 3-year agreement expands a nearly decade-long partnership between Flash and Live Nation which has issued three million parking passes to date. Specific venues include multiple House of Blues clubs, Brooklyn Bowl, Fillmore locations and others around the country.

Added Kern, “The unforgettable shows Live Nation creates are about connecting artists and fans in distinctive venues, and the partnership we’ve built over the years through our shared high standards for guest experience are a huge source of pride for our team at Flash.”

Note to editors: A full list of venues is available upon request.
