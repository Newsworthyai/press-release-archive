# Planetize Packaging Expands Product Line and Operations to Meet Demand for Sustainable Packaging Solutions

Planetize Packaging, a provider of eco-friendly packaging solutions, is significantly expanding its product line and streamlining operations in response to Canada’s single-use plastic ban. The company’s growth supports the increasing demand for biodegradable and recyclable alternatives in the food service industry.

Founded in July 2022 by entrepreneur Shravana Goswami, Planetize Packaging quickly responded to the ban by offering environmentally responsible options for foodservice businesses. Initially offering just 10 products, the company has expanded to over 500 items, including biodegradable sugarcane fiber containers, kraft paper bags, and recyclable to-go boxes. Planetize now serves a diverse range of clients, including cafes, hotels, and restaurants.

In conjunction with its product expansion, Planetize has optimized its operations to improve efficiency and service. The company has brought production in-house, enabling it to offer next-day delivery and customized branding options. This operational shift has created 10 new jobs and supports the company's commitment to sustainability while further establishing its family-oriented culture.

"As the demand for sustainable packaging continues to grow, we are enhancing our operational capacity to better serve our customers and the planet," said Shravana Goswami, Founder and CEO of Planetize Packaging. “The addition of next-day delivery and custom branding options allows us to better support food service businesses in their transition to eco-friendly packaging.”

Planetize plans to continue expanding its impact by building its own manufacturing facility, enabling the company to implement a “cradle-to-grave” approach to sustainability. Future initiatives include partnerships with composting and recycling programs, closing the loop on the lifecycle of its products.

"By offering sustainable solutions, we aim to help businesses reduce their environmental impact and contribute to a more circular economy," added Goswami.
