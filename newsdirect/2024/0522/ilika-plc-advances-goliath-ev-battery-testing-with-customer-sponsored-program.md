# Ilika Plc Advances Goliath EV Battery Testing with Customer-Sponsored Program

Ilika Plc CEO Graeme Purdy joined Steve Darling from Proactive to share news the company has initiated testing on its inaugural batch of P1 Goliath electric vehicle prototype batteries within a customer-sponsored initiative. This significant step follows the successful completion of production and rigorous in-house testing.

Ilika previously achieved a pivotal milestone, termed the D4 development point, announced in November. This milestone marks a design-freeze stage in Ilika's Goliath roadmap, forming the basis for the P1 prototype slated for customer release. The P1 prototype represents an intermediary phase on Ilika's journey towards its anticipated minimum viable product scheduled for 2025. Comprising solid-state pouch cells with an NMC cathode and silicon anode, the P1 prototype showcases promising advancements in battery technology.

Purdy confirmed that Ilika has effectively manufactured and tested batches of P1 pouch cells aligned with the D4 development point. Subsequently, the company has embarked on a customer-driven test program, marking the commencement of a series of commercial collaborations with automotive OEMs and Tier 1 companies.

Undeterred, Ilika remains focused on advancing along its roadmap towards the MVP milestone slated for the calendar year 2025. The Goliath MVP, represented by P2 prototypes, is poised to unlock licensing opportunities, signaling continued progress and innovation in the electric vehicle battery sector.
