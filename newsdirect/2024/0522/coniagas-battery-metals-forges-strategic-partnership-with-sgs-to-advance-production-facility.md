# Coniagas Battery Metals Forges Strategic Partnership with SGS to Advance Production Facility

Coniagas Battery Metals CEO Frank Basa joined Steve Darling from Proactive to unveil a significant collaboration with SGS, a globally renowned leader in inspection, verification, testing, and certification, through their Quebec City office. This strategic partnership is poised to propel Coniagas forward in its pursuit of funding and technological advancements in the Cobalt, Nickel, Copper, and Zinc sectors, ultimately paving the way for the establishment of a cutting-edge production facility in Quebec.

Basa elucidated that the primary objective of this collaboration is to strategically align Coniagas with Nord Precious Metals Mining Inc.’s Re-2Ox process, bolstering its preparedness for the technological and operational advancements essential to cater to the burgeoning Electric Vehicle market in Canada and North America.

As part of this multifaceted project, Coniagas aims to achieve technical readiness and devise a robust funding strategy. Moreover, the potential establishment of a pilot plant at SGS Quebec stands as a pivotal component of the initiative, accelerating the company’s technological readiness. This pilot plant is envisioned to delineate the criteria for a full-scale production facility and showcase, on a larger scale, Coniagas’ proficiency in processing various offshore feeds. Anticipated to process oxide feeds often overlooked or incompatible with traditional smelting methods, this endeavor promises to broaden Coniagas’ processing capabilities and expand its market reach.

Overall, the partnership with SGS represents a strategic move for Coniagas, positioning the company at the forefront of innovation in the battery metals sector. With a strong emphasis on sustainability, technological advancement, and market expansion, Coniagas is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of the EV industry.
