Institute Advances Babson’s Infusion of Technology and AI

into Entrepreneurial Education

Babson College announced today that C. Dean Metropoulos ’67, MBA’68 has made a transformational gift to launch the C. Dean Metropoulos Institute for Entrepreneurship and Technology. This marks a significant step forward in Babson’s strategic initiatives to advance and elevate the pivotal role of technology in entrepreneurial education. This generous gift reflects Metropoulos’ long-standing commitment to Babson and underscores the College’s commitment to innovation in the technology sector.

The C. Dean Metropoulos Institute for Entrepreneurship and Technology will build on Babson’s history of success preparing the next generation of entrepreneurial leaders to change the world. This groundbreaking institute will bolster Babson’s leading entrepreneurial education into the leadership ranks of technology and AI. The Institute will support and expand curricular and cocurricular programs that amplify the importance of technological innovation in the entrepreneurial process. Thought leadership initiatives will explore the critical need for guardrails when navigating the benefits and risks of emerging technologies and AI and their adoption in industry, medicine, and the environment. This focus will serve as the cornerstone of the Metropoulos Institute’s contribution through its emerging leaders.

“I am very proud to be part of Babson’s exciting new initiatives in this incredible frontier of technology and AI,” said C. Dean Metropoulos. “The past century has ushered in unprecedented scientific discoveries and innovation impacting humanity and our planet. It is very clear that these technologies are accelerating at a speed never before experienced. This tide clearly offers many opportunities that provide positive solutions to humanity in every aspect of life, from education, business, medicine, environment, and just day-to-day living.”

“And yet,” continued Metropoulos, “with all this progress, we face major global challenges of social and economic inequality, sustainability, and fostering a healthy planet for healthy humans. It is crucial that young leaders and entrepreneurs, business, government, philanthropists, and researchers will need to work closely together to positively impact the challenges confronting us.”

Metropoulos, a member of the undergraduate Class of 1967 and graduate Class of 1968, has long been a passionate supporter of Babson. He previously served as a trustee of the College and in 2017 was inducted into the Academy of Distinguished Entrepreneurs®. Dean and his sons, Evan and Daren, have specialized in the revival and reimagination of hundreds of historic, iconic and global brands and businesses in the food and beverage, consumer products, and other diversified sectors. Throughout their impressive career, Dean and his sons have transformed companies and accelerated revenue and earnings growth by restructuring the businesses and revitalizing and innovating iconic brands around the world.

“Babson’s ability to embrace new technologies and rapidly integrate them into our academic and experiential endeavors will be critical to our continued success,” said President Stephen Spinelli Jr. MBA’92, PhD. “It is inspiring to have such an innovative alumnus like C. Dean Metropoulos support our work and advance our leadership in this space.”

The C. Dean Metropoulos Institute for Entrepreneurship and Technology is expected to open in the fall of 2024.
