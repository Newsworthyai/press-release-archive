# Comcast Announces Major Fiber Network Expansion in UT

Comcast announced today it will continue to significantly expand its next-generation Xfinity network across several Utah counties over the next three years. The media and technology company will invest more than $138 million to install hundreds of miles of new fiber highways capable of delivering multi-gigabit speed. The planned expansions add to Comcast’s ongoing $500 million investment in Utah over the last three years.

In 2024, Comcast’s fiber network expansion will include communities in the counties of Box Elder, Davis, Salt Lake, Summit, Tooele, Utah, Wasatch, Weber and Utah County, parts of which already have access to Xfinity and Comcast Business services. These locations will have the foundational next-generation network in place to begin deploying DOCSIS 4.0, setting the stage for the introduction of new symmetrical multi-gigabit Internet options.

“Comcast’s $138M multi-gig speed fiber network expansion in Utah is a visionary investment in our state’s future,” said Utah Governor Spencer Cox. “By bolstering our fiber infrastructure, we’re not just enhancing connectivity; we’re future-proofing Utah’s economy and ensuring more Utahns have access to the digital opportunities of tomorrow.”

“Reliable high-speed Internet is essential in today’s digital economy, which is why Comcast continues its commitment to connect more Utahns to the moments that matter most,” said J.D. Keller, Senior Vice President, Comcast Mountain West Region. “By establishing the best broadband infrastructure today, we are securing the economic prosperity of these communities for tomorrow.”

Comcast’s commitment to new communities goes beyond the build, addressing digital opportunities in communities through Project UP, the company’s $1 billion dollar commitment to help tens of millions of people connect to the Internet and build futures of unlimited possibilities. Last year, Comcast Utah invested more than $4.6 million dollars to help local community organizations provide hands on digital skills training, offer workforce development/readiness workshops and other tech education to students, adults and people with disabilities. The funding also supports ongoing efforts to build awareness about affordable connectivity services like Internet Essentials, which offers eligible households high-speed Internet for $9.95/month or Internet Essentials Plus for $29.95/month. Affordable computers are also available through Internet Essentials.

“Comcast’s major fiber network expansion in Tooele heralds a new era of connectivity for Tooele County,” said. Andy Welch, Tooele County Manager. “With this expansion, we’re not just bridging the digital divide; we’re laying the foundation for our community’s future. As the fastest growing county in Utah, Tooele is poised for unprecedented population growth and business development. This investment ensures we have the infrastructure in place to support and empower every resident and entrepreneur as we pay the way for a vibrant, connected future.”

Through Project UP, Comcast is partnering with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Salt Lake to offer youth opportunities to develop the technology skills necessary to compete in today’s competitive workforce and obtain sustainable employment. Over the last two years, Comcast provided $140,000 in cash and in-kind to Utah Boys and Girls Clubs to fund technology training and six community WiFi-connected Lift Zones so families can get online when they need it most.

One of those Lift Zones is the Tooele Boys and Girls Clubs, where Comcast is supporting their STEM learning – specifically in Esports.

"Comcast's network expansion is pivotal for Tooele Youth," said Amanda Hughes, Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Salt Lake, CEO. "With this project and the new Comcast Lift Zone, we're not just connecting homes; we're overcoming the digital divide. Partnerships – like this one with Comcast – empower our young minds with vital tech skills and ensure access to the tools they need to thrive in today's digital landscape."
