# UnifyApps secures $11Mn to transform enterprise integrations with generative AI

The average enterprise uses nearly 400 SaaS applications that are not connected to each other, leading to data silos and scattered insights across the organization. In a significant move to streamline this process, UnifyApps has announced an $11 million seed funding round to build a unified integration platform that will allow enterprises to create custom applications 10x faster, build workflow automations and sync data between applications in real-time. The funding, led by Elevation Capital, along with participation from the founders and angel investors, underscores the growing demand for real-time connectivity between applications in the enterprise technology landscape.

UnifyApps was co-founded by Pavitar Singh (CEO), who served as the CTO at NYSE-listed enterprise software company Sprinklr, along with Sumeet Nandal (COO), Abhishek Kurana (CPO), Rachit Mittal (CTO), Abhinav Singi (VP Engineering), Rahul Anishetty (VP Engineering), Kavish Manubolu (VP Engineering) and Shivam Satrawal (VP Product Management). The idea for UnifyApps was born after the founders realized that enterprise companies lacked a solution for seamless app integration, leaving tremendous untapped value from cost optimizations and efficiency gains.

Pavitar Singh, CEO of UnifyApps, said, "The rapid adoption of SaaS applications has led to building silos within the organization with each team using their own set of tools which are not connected to the rest of the organization. Our vision is to change this by making integration simple and accessible, enhancing experiences for both customers and employees".

What sets UnifyApps apart is its comprehensive approach to integration, addressing four critical areas: data sync, workflow automation, no-code application development, and the creation of generative AI agents. While competitors may focus on individual areas, UnifyApps offers a holistic solution that delivers a better return on investment (ROI) and lower total cost of ownership (TCO) for customers. Currently, UnifyApps is targeting large, forward-thinking enterprises globally. The platform is designed to be ready for enterprise scale and complexity.

Looking ahead, UnifyApps plans to expand its platform to support over 5,000 applications and give organizations the flexibility to build their own custom integrations in less than a day. The company is also committed to advancing the capabilities of generative AI and building fine-tuned, purpose-built LLM-powered agents that will leverage these integrations.

"Our goal is to deliver value first products and obsess over customer satisfaction. We want enterprises to truly unlock the full potential of their technology investments. By using UnifyApps, they can unlock a lot of hidden value from their current SaaS ecosystem and propel the next level of growth.” added Pavitar Singh.

Mukul Arora, Co-managing Partner, Elevation Capital, said, “We are really excited to partner with Pavitar, who has deep experience in building a large enterprise-focused SaaS business, and was instrumental in growing Sprinklr to a multi-100mn dollar revenue company. With UnifyApps, he wants to build a future where seamless unification across applications and data can help large enterprises automate complex business processes and bring unparalleled efficiency. We believe this can be a massive opportunity and are thrilled to be a part of this journey.”

With a strong foundation and a clear vision, UnifyApps is poised to reduce fragmented systems & bridge data silos by enabling teams to build complex applications, automate workflows and unify data across multiple applications.
