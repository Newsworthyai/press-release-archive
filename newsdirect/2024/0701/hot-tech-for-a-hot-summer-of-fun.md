Smart Financial Tools for Kids Starting Summer Jobs

Many kids are starting summer jobs and it’s important to provide them with age-appropriate financial tools to help them learn how to responsibly manage their money.

Chase's High School and College Checking accounts are great for this–these accounts provide helpful tools to manage their finances more independently, and all through the Chase Mobile® app.

With features like Zelle® for sending money, tracking what they’ve spent, and help with budgeting, kids won’t need to download multiple apps, making it easier for both them and their parents. It's all about empowering them to gain financial independence in a digital-first world.

Revolutionizing Summer Grilling with Weber’s Searwood Pellet Grill
