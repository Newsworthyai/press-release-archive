In a moment of persistent inflation and market uncertainty, small businesses are vital growth drivers—yet few are recognized for their contributions to our economy in a meaningful way.

To elevate the nation’s most innovative and resilient small businesses, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is recognizing businesses who are driving innovation, growth, and ingenuity in their communities.

Small businesses are invited to apply for the CO—100, an exclusive list of the 100 best small and mid-sized businesses in America who have impressive growth strategies, innovative products and services, and an unwavering dedication to serving local communities.

As entrepreneurs navigate the current economic landscape, programs like the CO—100 provide essential recognition and resources to help them thrive.

The CO—100 is an awards program run by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that recognizes and celebrates America’s Top Small Businesses.

This exclusive list honors businesses that excel and stand out in 10 categories: Growth Accelerators, Community Champions, Micro-Business Leaders, Champions of Adaptability, Customer Champions, Global Stars, Digital Innovators, Enduring Businesses, The Disruptors, and Culture Champions.

On June 25th, a media tour was conducted with Jeanette Mulvey, Vice President and Editor-in-Chief of CO— by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Topics that were discussed by Jeanette Mulvey, Vice President and Editor-in-Chief of CO— by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce included:

· CO—100: This awards program and the U.S. Chamber’s support for small businesses as key growth drivers in America.

· Innovation, Growth & Impact: Qualities that make for a successful small business—and how to highlight these traits on the CO—100 application and get noticed by an esteemed panel of judges.

· Recognition, Exposure & Opportunity: The benefits of applying to be recognized on the CO—100 list and opportunities available to the honorees.
