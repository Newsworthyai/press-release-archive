The digital world can be a challenge to navigate, and helping keep teens safe online is not just a priority—it’s a necessity.

Snapchat is working to make its app even safer—now expanding a range of features to help keep Snapchat a place where people can be comfortable expressing themselves with the friends they know in real life.

These extra protections for young people are more than a tech upgrade—they’re part of Snapchat’s ongoing commitment to building tools to help users connect with friends in a safe, secure way.

Rachel Hochhauser, Snap’s Head of Safety Operations Outreach, conducted a nationwide media tour on June 25th to discuss these new features.

Topics and features she discussed included:

· Expanded In-app Warnings

Teens will now see a warning message if they receive a chat from someone who’s been blocked or reported by others or is from a region where the teen’s network isn't typically located – signs that the person may be a stranger.

· Simplified Location-Sharing

Expansion of reminders to make sure Snapchatters are always up to date on which friends they’re sharing their location with on the Snap Map.

· Enhanced Friending Protections

These protections prevent certain suspicious friend requests from getting to teens in the first place, further reducing teens’ ability to connect with people they may not know in real life.

· Blocking Improvements

Improvements aim to prevent bullying and repeated harassment by limiting outreach from any new accounts created by someone who’s been blocked.
