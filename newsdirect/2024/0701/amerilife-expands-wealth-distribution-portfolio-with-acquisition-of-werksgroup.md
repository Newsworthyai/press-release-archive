# AmeriLife Expands Wealth Distribution Portfolio with Acquisition of WerksGroup

AmeriLife Group, LLC (“AmeriLife”), a national leader in developing, marketing, and distributing life and health insurance, annuities, and retirement planning solutions, announced today a strategic partnership with WerksGroup, LLC and its primary business line, MyFedRetirementWerks, helping Federal Employees optimize their retirement and benefit options. This partnership will enhance the retirement and life insurance guidance available to federal employees, offering a more comprehensive range of solutions to help them achieve their long-term financial goals. Per the agreement, the terms of the deal were not disclosed.

“Our company began with a simple phrase: ‘One big purpose,’” said Richard and Karen Wolfe, principals of WerksGroup, LLC. “We believe that financial guidance is more than just selling products. It is the pursuit of helping clients create and implement a plan to achieve their long-term life goals. Partnering with AmeriLife strengthens that mission, broadens our reach, and merges our core values seamlessly.”

With over 60 years of combined retirement planning and life insurance expertise, WerksGroup, LLC has built its business on the idea that relationships are more important than sales. As such, the company has focused on nurturing a client base of those who serve the American people, including employees of the U.S. Postal Service, the Department of Veteran Affairs, the Central Intelligence Agency, and various other federal agencies and departments.

“Our success and this partnership would not have been possible without the dedication of our management team and minority partners, Patrick Shehan from our sales division in the postal and federal market, and Mark Ross, who was critical in expanding our annuity market. Their contributions were exemplary in bringing our vision to fruition and building WerksGroup into a great organization,” added Richard and Karen.

As part of AmeriLife Wealth Group, WerksGroup will gain access to a best-in-class platform that delivers efficiency, value, and access to diverse resources and services to increase their productivity and grow their bottom line.

“We are immensely impressed with Richard and Karen and their dedication and expertise while growing WerksGroup,” said AmeriLife Chief Distribution Officer of Wealth Distribution Mike Vietri. “Their exceptional work in the life insurance and annuity sectors has played a pivotal role in ensuring the retirement comfort of their federal employee clients. We are excited to integrate their strengths into our portfolio and continue building on their success.”
