# WagerWire Launches Buying and Selling of Fantasy Entries in App

WagerWire, a sports gaming marketplace technology company serving sportsbooks and fantasy operators, today announced that buying and selling is now live in their app, available in the iOS and Google Play stores. This marks the first time that fantasy players can legally buy and sell daily fantasy Pick’em entries with the tap of a button.

WagerWire users are now able to buy and sell RealTime Fantasy Sports entries on the app, with more fantasy operators to be added for trading soon. WagerWire announced their integration with RealTime Fantasy in January 2024, allowing users to sell their Pick’em lineups while in progress, including during the actual game, directly on the RTFS platform. During the NFL playoffs, the marketplace saw 12% of all DFS Pick’em lineups sell on the secondary market.

“This is a paradigm shifting moment for fantasy,” said WagerWire Co-Founder and CEO Zach Doctor. “This launch represents a way to bring more ownership and control over their entries. For the first time, there is a way to cash in on your lineups even if they go on to lose - by selling it to a friend or on the open market. The excitement is palpable.”

The newly launched fantasy marketplace is the latest addition to the growing technology portfolio of WagerWire’s parent company Wire Industries, Inc. Their app already hosts an array of marketplace tools for both sports betting and fantasy including stat tracking, account syncing, bet value graph builders and calculator, and social features that allow users to follow how their friends, influencers, or sharps are playing.

“I’ve been playing fantasy for years, but being able to sell my DFS lineups is game-changing," said Braiden Payne, RealTime Fantasy Sports veteran user. "I’m also loving being able to buy and sell in-game and see the progress of my picks with live price suggestions. The RT marketplace in the WagerWire app takes an already great and easy-to-use experience to the next level.”

WagerWire was recently shortlisted for two awards at SBC North America – Rising Star of the Year and Affiliate of the Year, in addition to EGR's Rising Star of the Year and Hashtag Sport’s Best X Presence award.

WagerWire burst onto the scene in 2021 with the announcement of a high-profile seed round led by Miami Marlins co-owner Roger Ehrenberg, Eberg Capital and NBA All-Star Richard Jefferson. They are a licensed affiliate and media partner to top US sportsbooks including BetMGM, BetRivers, Caesars, FanDuel, Hard Rock Bet, SuperBook and more.
