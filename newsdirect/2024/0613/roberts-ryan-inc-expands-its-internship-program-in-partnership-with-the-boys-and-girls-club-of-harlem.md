# Roberts & Ryan Inc. expands its internship program in partnership with the Boys and Girls Club of Harlem.

Roberts & Ryan, Inc., America’s first Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned (SDVO) broker-dealer, announced the expansion of its summer internship program, which recently accepted 13 candidates from a diverse pool of students from a variety of schools and backgrounds. The expansion reflects the company’s commitment to supporting veterans and underprivileged youth.

“At Roberts & Ryan, we believe that supporting future generations of financial professionals is important to the long-term success of our industry. This year’s internship class was bolstered by our relationship with the Boys & Girls Club of Harlem, who recommended two exceptional candidates, creating more opportunities for diverse talent in the financial services industry,” said Brian Rathjen, President of Roberts & Ryan.

Seven interns completed Roberts & Ryan's internship program in 2023, a number the firm nearly doubled in 2024 due to increased student demand.

Roberts & Ryan runs two internship cohorts per year to provide students from a variety of backgrounds with real-world experience in the financial services industry. Interns collaborate with experienced professionals on projects that demonstrate a range of services provided by Roberts & Ryan, from secondary equity and fixed income trading to debt and equity capital markets, business development, compliance, and marketing. Roberts & Ryan was recently approved for membership by the New York Stock Exchange, and summer interns have access to its iconic trading floor.

"Breaking into the financial services industry can be a challenge, as most entry-level positions require either previous work experience or a professional connection with someone in the industry. We believe that our program provides our interns with both,” said Edward D’Alessandro, Chief Executive Officer of Roberts & Ryan.

Roberts & Ryan is committed to increasing access to opportunities in the financial sector by finding high-quality candidates for their internship program. Through the program, interns gain valuable experience, make important connections, and build a talent stack for a successful career in finance.
