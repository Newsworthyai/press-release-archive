# Coniagas Battery Metals Expands Exploration at Graal Project with Promising Results

Coniagas Battery Metals CEO Frank Basa joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce that the company is actively applying for permits to expand the near-surface mineral resources at the Graal project in Quebec. This expansion aims to further delineate the resource potential and enhance the project's economic viability.

The Graal project has confirmed an open-pit deposit model along a 6 km strike length, featuring high-grade nickel and copper with cobalt, platinum, and palladium byproducts. The company plans to conduct additional drilling in the near term, leading to the production of a NI 43-101 resource report.

Basa shared that the company is building on the excellent drilling results reported from the MHY and Gravi zones, which confirm shallow, near-surface mineralization. Significant drill intercepts include 28.90 meters of 2.28% CuEq, including 0.73% Nickel, 0.41% Copper, 0.09% Cobalt, 0.04 g/t Platinum and 0.05 g/t Palladium

These results reinforce the significant potential of the Graal property to host valuable nickel, copper, and cobalt mineralization. The ongoing and planned exploration activities aim to enhance the resource base and support the project's economic feasibility, positioning Coniagas Battery Metals for future growth and development.
