# Diamond Lake Minerals and Horizon Fintex Announce $3.75 Million Share Exchange Agreement

Diamond Lake Minerals CEO Brian J. Esposito and Horizon Fintex CEO Brian Collins joined Steve Darling from Proactive to share news of a significant $3.75 million share exchange agreement between Diamond Lake Minerals and Horizon Fintex, involving Horizon Fintex's regulated tokenized-securities exchange, Upstream.

Under the terms of the agreement, Horizon Fintex issued 1,250 common shares, valued at $3,000 per share, in exchange for 1,000,000 newly issued common shares in Diamond Lake Minerals. This partnership is designed for mutual benefit, aiming to attract new issuers to list on Upstream, thereby increasing Upstream's trading liquidity and providing economic advantages to the shareholders of both companies. Upstream is the only market seeking to offer investors direct exchange access to primary and dual listed equities from all over the world right from their smartphones.

Alongside the share exchange partnership, Diamond Lake Minerals also signed a Cooperation, Marketing, and Referral Agreement with a Horizon Fintex subsidiary. This agreement designates Diamond Lake Minerals as a commercial advisor, responsible for introducing and referring issuers who are seeking to list on Upstream.

One of the unique aspects of Upstream is that investors are directly connected to the exchange via the Upstream trading app, eliminating the need for stockbroker middlemen. Investors can trade in real-time, 20 hours a day, five days a week. The platform offers streamlined onboarding, transparent order books where all participants can see level-2 bids and offers, and is designed to prevent market manipulation techniques such as short selling, stock lending, wash trades, and payment for order flow. This is achieved through Horizon Fintex's advanced Ethereum smart-contract technologies.
