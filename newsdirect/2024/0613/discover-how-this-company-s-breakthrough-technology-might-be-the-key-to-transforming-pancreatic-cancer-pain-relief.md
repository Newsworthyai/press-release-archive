Pancreatic cancer is notorious for its high mortality rate but also for the severe pain it inflicts on patients. This pain often manifests as significant abdominal and back pain, making it difficult for patients to comfortably sit or lie on their back. The debilitating nature of this pain severely impacts the quality of life of those affected, and it can be particularly challenging to manage. As such, it is a condition primed for innovative solutions to help patients.

Pancreatic Pain Management StrategiesThe pain associated with pancreatic cancer is primarily due to the tumor's proximity to critical nerves and blood vessels. As the tumor grows, it can compress these nerves, leading to intense pain that is challenging to manage. Patients frequently experience persistent and severe abdominal and back pain that can significantly restrict their daily activities and mobility. Emotional distress, anxiety and depression often accompany chronic pain, affecting both patients and their caregivers.

The current strategies for managing pancreatic cancer pain are limited and often ineffective. Pain medications, such as opioids, are commonly prescribed but come with significant side effects like constipation, drowsiness and the risk of addiction. Additionally, these medications may lose their effectiveness over time, leading to increased tolerance and necessitating higher doses. Meanwhile, nerve blocks and ablation techniques, while potentially effective, often lack precision and can cause unintended side effects by missing target nerves and damaging surrounding tissues. This imprecision stems from the inability of other technologies to accurately detect weak electrical signals from the peripheral nervous system. However, Autonomix’s catheter-based technology uses a microchip and antenna to precisely detect nerves, which allows for a safe and accurate pain treatment.

Approximately 70% to 80% of patients with pancreatic cancer experience pain, with around 44% reporting severe pain as the disease progresses. Breakthrough pain, which occurs despite ongoing pain management, has a high prevalence of 33%-95%, with 50% to 90% of all hospitalized patients experiencing it – further complicating treatment. This unrelenting pain significantly impacts the patient's quality of life, contributing to both physical and emotional distress that demands better management strategies.

Autonomix's Approach to Pancreatic Cancer PainAutonomix Medical (NASDAQ: AMIX) is a medical device company pioneering a groundbreaking technology to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and disorders related to the autonomic nervous system. Their first-in-class technology platform features a catheter-based microchip sensing array that can detect and differentiate neural signals with remarkable sensitivity, up to 3,000 times greater than currently available technologies, according to the company.

This innovative technology allows the company to sense the overactive nerves which lead to the intense pain caused by pancreatic cancer. Then Autonomix is able to ablate, or kill, those overactive nerves, effectively turning off the pain signal. By providing a more accurate and targeted approach, Autonomix aims to improve the quality of life for patients suffering from pancreatic cancer pain.

First-In-Human Pilot StudiesAutonomix recently commenced its first in-human pilot study in pancreatic cancer pain. This marks the first trial ever to evaluate radiofrequency (RF) ablation using a transvascular approach to reduce pain associated with pancreatic cancer. The study involves 25 subjects at a single clinical site, aiming to assess the ablation of relevant nerves and subsequent pain mitigation.

Autonomix announced it will release preliminary results from the first five “lead-in” patients in the study on Tuesday, June 18, 2024 and management will host a live webcast at 8:30 AM ET to discuss the results. Click here to register for the webcast.

A New Dawn in Pain ManagementPancreatic cancer pain is a significant and challenging issue that severely impacts patients' quality of life. Current pain management strategies are often inadequate, underscoring the need for innovative solutions. Autonomix's technology offers a promising alternative, with the potential to provide precise and effective pain relief for patients suffering from pancreatic cancer pain. By targeting a smaller market initially, Autonomix aims to prove the effectiveness of its technology, paving the way for broader applications in the future across conditions where pain is a key symptom.
