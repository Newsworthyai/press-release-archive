# Blockmate Ventures' Subsidiary Hivello announces partnerships to aid August Token Launch

Blockmate Ventures CEO Justin Rosenberg joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce the upcoming launch of a native token for Hivello's platform. This launch, set for August 30, 2024, will be supported by three new commercial partners and will provide essential utility within the Hivello DePIN platform.

Rosenberg detailed the platform's development, highlighting the Hivello Windows app, which entered private beta in May. The app has already garnered significant interest, with over 20,000 users subscribing to the waitlist. The platform aims to simplify Web3 mining for novices, enabling them to utilize unused computing power to generate passive income.

To ensure the successful promotion and launch of the token, Hivello has partnered with several renowned agencies. Luna PR, known for its expertise in Web3 and emerging technologies, will lead the promotional efforts. Technical growth will be supported by Winn.Solutions, while Forgd, an innovative agency, will contribute to the launch preparations. These strategic partnerships are poised to enhance the platform's reach and effectiveness as it approaches the highly anticipated token launch.

With this strategic approach and strong support from leading agencies, Blockmate Ventures and Hivello Holdings are set to make a significant impact in the Web3 space, offering users a simplified and efficient way to engage in mining activities and generate passive income.
