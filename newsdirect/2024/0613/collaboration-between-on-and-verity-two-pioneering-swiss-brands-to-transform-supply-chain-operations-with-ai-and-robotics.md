# Collaboration between On and Verity – two pioneering Swiss brands – to transform supply chain operations with AI and robotics

On, a leading global sportswear brand, and Verity, a pioneering AI and robotics company, have announced a strategic collaboration to transform warehouse operations and optimize inventory management, ultimately enhancing supply chain efficiency and precision.

On and Verity join forces, leveraging fleets of fully autonomous drones in warehouses to enable full operational visibility through smart, real-time inventory tracking, minimizing stockouts, misplacements, and shrinkage across the supply chain. This ensures flawless order fulfillment for retail and e-commerce.

On is one of the fastest growing sportswear brands in history and seeks every technical advantage in its supply chain execution to support this growth. On identified Verity, renowned for its expertise in AI and robotics, as their preferred partner with in-depth technical expertise and a proven, intelligent and efficient system. Verity’s solution is used to perform millions of fully autonomous inventory checks each month in over 80 warehouses operated by different clients worldwide.

This partnership delivers tangible business value by improving immediate product availability across On customer touchpoints—at physical stores and online—and maximizing successful order fulfillment by improving on-time and accurate deliveries. Verity clients see their operational issue rates reduced from 5-12% to less than 1%, significantly increasing their warehouses’ labor efficiency. By further digitizing On's supply chain, Verity strengthens its data accuracy and improves the quality and speed of decision-making.

Already live at a US facility, Verity’s fleet of fully autonomous drones is scanning On products on a daily basis, ensuring full availability of stock for customer fulfillment. It is already improving key performance indicators (KPIs) and supporting On's objectives as a pioneer of new, more sustainable supply chains, by reducing CO2 emissions linked to warehousing: Verity clients observe a reduction of 1,000 tons of CO2 emissions per warehouse each year, on average. The collaboration’s goal is to explore new technology solutions to drive operational excellence and enhance inventory visibility, with On bringing Verity onboard with its 3PL partners.

"We are excited to partner with Verity to transform our supply chain operations," said Caspar Coppetti, Co-Founder and Executive Co-Chairman at On. "Verity is a pioneering brand in the field of AI and robotics, and a perfect fit with On's values of harnessing innovation for the benefit of the customer experience. By leveraging innovative technological solutions, we aim to improve our operations' efficiency further, become a more sustainable brand, and take customer satisfaction to new heights. The collaboration of two pioneering Swiss brands can only mean an explosion of innovation!"
