Bitget, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange and Web3 company, has announced its partnerships with Alchemy Pay and GEO Pay (Swapple), two leading crypto payment solution providers. With their support, Bitget users can now buy and sell crypto using various local currencies.

The integration with payment services will allow users to convert crypto into fiat with several top channels such as IDR – QRIS/DANA/OVO, PHP – GCash/Maya, MYR – DuitNow, THB – Thai QR/TrueMoney and VND – MOMO/Viet QR/ViettelPay, and bank transfer are available to all currencies mentioned above.

Alchemy Pay as one of the leading payment gateways in crypto connects platforms with traditional payment solutions. It supports payments across 173 countries, facilitating easier and broader access to crypto worldwide. GEO Pay, recently rebranded as Swapple, complements this partnership by offering a platform that merges peer-to-peer payments with innovative fiat-to-crypto exchange services. It provides secure and low-fee transactions, enhancing the fiat-to-crypto exchange experience, offering reward incentives to its community.

Bitget has been constantly expanding its services throughout the globe bringing more regional benefits to its users.

With Alchemy Pay and GEO Pay (Swapple), Bitget will provide users with a locally sophisticated, secure, and user-friendly platform, making the transition from fiat to digital currency effortless for users across multiple regions.

“Bitget’s ecosystem is leaning to build a more user-friendly experience for crypto.

As we expand our services, we will partner up with more such payment companies, enabling people throughout the world to get a step closer to crypto,” said Gracy Chen, Managing Director at Bitget
