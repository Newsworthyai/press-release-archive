# MetaWin Founder Launches $ROCKY Meme Coin on Base Network

--News Direct--

An exciting new meme coin, $ROCKY, has recently debuted on the Base network. Skel.eth, the founder of MetaWin, launched the coin last weekend. Intriguingly, the coin is named after his Pomeranian, also named ROCKY.

Within just 30 hours of its release, $ROCKY achieved an impressive market cap of $4.6 million, and the MetaWin team is optimistic about further growth, fueled by the enthusiastic support of the MetaWin community.

"I launched it as an experiment ahead of our $MWIN token sale," said Skel.eth, the founder of MetaWin and the creative force behind $ROCKY. "It is working out pretty well so far! We've learned a lot, and it's great to see the community benefit financially. Despite my advice to cash in on their gains early, many have held onto their coins, and it's taken on a life of its own, amazing really‚Äù.

Looking ahead, MetaWin plans to integrate $ROCKY into upcoming community competitions, thus enhancing its utility beyond that of a typical meme coin. These initiatives aim to cement $ROCKY's role within the community and further validate the coin's slogan: "MORE than a meme coin."

With a solid foundation established by Skel.eth two years ago, MetaWin now boasts nearly 250,000 connected wallets and a seasoned team of 80 professionals specialising in Web3 technologies. This depth of expertise is expected to drive further innovation and success for $ROCKY.

Users can participate in $ROCKY daily competitions for free on BASE or with an NFT purchase. According to the Metawin team, all generated revenue will be utilised to purchase more $ROCKY immediately after the competition concludes, serving as a bonus for holders.
