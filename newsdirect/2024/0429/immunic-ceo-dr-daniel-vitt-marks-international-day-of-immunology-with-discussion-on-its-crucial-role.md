# Immunic CEO Dr Daniel Vitt marks International Day of Immunology with discussion on its crucial role

--News Direct--

Immunic Inc CEO Dr Daniel Vitt joins Proactive's Stephen Gunnion on the International Day of Immunology to discuss the broad and crucial role of immunology in human health.

Vitt said immunology encompasses immune responses against pathogens like viruses, including the coronavirus, and also plays a significant role in combating cancer. He highlighted the importance of the immune system in managing and preventing autoimmune diseases, where the body mistakenly attacks its own cells, leading to various conditions.

Focusing on Immunic's efforts, Vitt detailed their drug development pipeline, particularly in addressing chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and celiac disease. He spotlighted multiple sclerosis, with ongoing phase three studies in its relapsing form and a phase two study, named the CALLIPER trial, for its progressive form. The latter holds particular promise as it targets an area with currently no available treatments.

For celiac disease, Vitt reported promising results from a phase one B proof-of-concept study that showed positive data across various metrics, including histology and biomarker levels. Plans are underway for further phase two studies in celiac disease and potentially other indications.

Vitt also shared his personal journey from chemistry to immunology, driven by the potential to develop drugs that address significant medical needs.
