BLOCKCHAIN, THE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS CHANGING THE WORLDBlockchain is the most disruptive technology that has been created since the emergence of the Internet in the last century. This technology was designed for decentralized data storage, in a public, secure and immutable way. Therefore, it is the technology behind Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

For years, large corporations and banks have explored its possibilities and applications in the real world, achieving several significant use cases. Blockchain technology is based on a chain of blocks that stores operations by stacking blocks in a continuous and decentralized manner.

This type of database has the advantage of being public and immutable, which allows third parties to verify the data stored there, in each of the blocks of the chain. Hence, its main usefulness is that it is seen as a large, unalterable, and shared accounting book with operations that a large number of computers record simultaneously.
