Essential to the brand’s complexion product line, the Pressed Powder is formulated to balance melanin-rich skin tones with a matte finish that looks fresh all day. The lightweight, pigment-rich powder is available in twelve shades, including 3 new fair to light shades to meet the diverse range of complexions among women of color. All shades are available now on Amazon and in-store at Walmart in June.

Over 90% of consumers indicated skin moisture was significantly improved after applying the formula. The shea butter lip balm is infused with Vitamin E, Sodium Hyaluronate, and an exclusive blend of ten botanical oils, to prime, moisturize, soften, and condition lips. The multi-benefit lip balm comes in 5 vibrant yet sheer shades to accentuate melanated lips, including Pamper in clear, Kissable in mauve, Pucker Up in red, Luscious in plum, and the best-seller Smooches in fuchsia.

Black Radiance Bold & Sexy™ Gel Eyeliner contours, shapes, and defines with custom definition. The dual-ended pencil features two waterproof formulas, a thin, tapered pencil for contouring and outlining and a thicker crayon that saturates eyelids with smudge-proof matte color that can be worn as an eye shadow.

Rounding out the collection, Black Radiance expanded the Brilliant Effects™ Eye Shadow Palette collections with two new colorways: Paradise and Starstruck. Paradise features twelve pigment-rich hues inspired by an oasis of lush, evergreen gardens to define eyes with vivid imagination while Starstruck captivates attention with mesmerizing metallic shades that give eyes a sensational glow.
