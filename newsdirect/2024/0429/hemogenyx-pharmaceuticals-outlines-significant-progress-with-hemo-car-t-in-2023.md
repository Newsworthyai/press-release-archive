# Hemogenyx Pharmaceuticals outlines significant progress with HEMO-CAR-T in 2023

--News Direct--

Hemogenyx Pharmaceuticals PLC CEO Dr Vladislav Sandler tells Proactive's Stephen Gunnion that 2023 was a significant year for the company, marked by notable progress with its HEMO-CAR-T product candidate.

The key achievement for the year was the submission of a new Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to commence a phase one clinical trial for the treatment of relapsed refractory acute myeloid leukemia. However, the process faced a setback due to issues with lentivirus purity, resulting in a clinical hold. After re-manufacturing the lentivirus, Hemogenyx successfully addressed the FDA's concerns and received approval to proceed with the clinical trials.

Furthermore, Sandler reported a successful fundraising which will support the upcoming clinical studies. The company also entered a service agreement with Prevail Infoworks for the clinical trials.

In addition to its advancements in HEMO-CAR-T, Hemogenyx continued developing other programs, such as its proprietary Chimeric Bait Receptor (CBR) platform, showing promise in treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma and exploring applications in solid rare tumors.

For 2024, the primary focus remains on advancing these clinical trials, particularly the phase one studies, with an immediate goal to initiate patient treatment.
