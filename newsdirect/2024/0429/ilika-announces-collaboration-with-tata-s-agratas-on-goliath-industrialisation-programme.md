# Ilika announces collaboration with Tata's Agratas on Goliath industrialisation programme

--News Direct--

Ilika PLC (AIM:IKA, OTCQX:ILIKF) CEO Graeme Purdy tells Proactive's Stephen Gunnion that Agratas, Tata Group’s battery business, has joined the SiSTEM project which aims to build a 1.5MWh solid-state battery (SSB) assembly line.

Purdy noted that SiSTEM was awarded a £2.7 million grant from the Advanced Propulsion Centre as part of the Automotive Transformation Fund. This grant supports the collaboration with UK Battery Industrialisation Centre (UK BIC) and Mpac Group plc to develop a 1.5MW hour solid-state battery assembly line.

The line will produce large format pouch cells for electric vehicles (EVs), with scale-up trials to occur at UK BIC using industry-ready equipment. Agratas' participation is primarily to evaluate and design a concept facility for implementing solid-state battery manufacturing at Gigafactory scale.

Purdy views this collaboration as a significant validation of Ilika’s technology, demonstrating commercial interest in their capabilities. Additionally, a 12-month bilateral collaboration with Agratas will focus on developing a D8 prototype, a minimum viable product that will test the scalability and performance of the battery technology.
