Teague comes to SWS with 19 years of municipal banking experience at Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities, and Goldman Sachs. He has executed numerous public finance deals for a diversified set of infrastructure and transportation issuing clients across the Midwest Region and Texas, including a $2.9 billion green-field toll road for the Grand Parkway Transportation Corporation in Houston.

As a Manager Director of Public Finance at SWS, Teague will focus on originating business with surface transportation issuers throughout the country.

“Collin joining us is further evidence of our commitment to growing our public finance platform with a particular emphasis on those areas where we believe there will be voluminous issuance,” said Gary Hall, President of Infrastructure & Public Finance at the firm. “Given the need for both capital improvements and investment in the surface transportation sector, we want to have a seasoned banker focused in this area.”

Based in Siebert Williams Shank’s New York office, Teague will provide investment banking services and structure deal transactions for toll roads, highways, and transit systems.

“With the COVID relief money running out, we believe these municipalities need to raise capital in other ways, which we think is in the issuance of bonds,” said Sewon Kim, Manager Director and Head of Transportation Group. “So we see opportunities because of that, in addition to tremendous infrastructure needs across the country. Having a senior banker like Collin investing his time and efforts on the surface transportation sector will give us significant leverage in a key growth area of public finance.”

Teague is known as a highly technical banker with broad intellectual curiosity and a strong work ethic.

“Siebert is a growing company while several others are not growing or even contracting,” Teague said. “Municipal finance is a core business of Siebert, and the surface transportation side really attracted me because that’s what I want to focus on in the next step of my career.”
