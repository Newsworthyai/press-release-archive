# Cooper Metals sows seeds for busy June quarter amid heavy drilling activity

--News Direct--

Cooper Metals Ltd (ASX:CPM) managing director Ian Warland is back in the Proactive studio to recap drilling activities and the explorer’s latest quarterly report.Cooper has just completed its third drilling campaign of the year, targeting copper-gold mineralisation across four regional targets at its Mt Isa East project in northwest Queensland. The prospects in question — Raven, Mafic Sweats North, Mafic Sweats South and Yarraman — were together the focus of 12 reverse circulation holes and around 1,800 metres of drilling.Following the campaign, more than 500 one-metre samples were dispatched for analysis to a laboratory in Mt Isa, primarily from the prominent Mafic Sweats South prospect. While a busy exploration season has hampered lab turnaround times, Warland is excited to bring fresh results to the market in the current quarter.Recapping the last three months of activity, the MD highlighted regional drilling endeavours and sampling efforts across the project portfolio. He also called out the Brumby Ridge and Guru targets, where the explorer hopes to be on the ground again in short order.Looking ahead, Warland noted that the company is well funded to keep the momentum going, with A$4.4 million in the bank thanks to a recent capital raise. The company looks forward to delivering more assays, completing regional geochem and mapping programs and building on its portfolio of drilling targets before the end of the financial year.
