# Adro and Funds Validator join forces to improve international student mobility, access to financial services

--News Direct--

Adro, a New York-based technology company enabling access to checking, savings and credit for international students and workers announced today a strategic partnership with Funds Validator, a leader in funds verification.

Funds Validator helps authenticate the bank details of international students and their sponsors to provide accurate and secure confirmation of their financial capacity, allowing universities and other stakeholders to make more informed decisions.

“We know Funds Validator is deeply aligned with Adro’s mission to make settling in the U.S. easier for internationals,” said Amarildo Gjondrekaj, CEO and Co-founder at Adro. “Given we work closely with our university partners to provide a financial on-ramp for their students, it just made sense to join forces.”

“Funds Validator focuses on the earlier aspects of an international student’s journey, when every applicant must comply with the host government regulations to prove financial capacity,” said Cheryl Darrup-Boychuck, CEO at Funds Validator. “We’re excited to partner with Adro, given their experience in streamlining student access to those funds – especially during their transition from their home country to the U.S. By minimizing obstacles to student mobility, we help ensure internationals will thrive in their next chapter.”

As Adro gears up to launch this summer, their account waitlist is now live at www.joinadro.com. Universities interested in learning more about partnering with Adro for the upcoming 2024-2025 academic year can visit www.joinadro.com/university.
