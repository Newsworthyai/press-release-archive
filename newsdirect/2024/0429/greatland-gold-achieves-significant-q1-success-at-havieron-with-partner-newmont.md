# Greatland Gold achieves significant Q1 success at Havieron with partner Newmont

--News Direct--

Greatland Gold PLC managing director Shaun Day described the March quarter as highly successful for its Havieron gold project, marked by significant achievements and a solid partnership with Newmont. This quarter was the first full period since Newmont took over operations in late December.

In an interview with Proactive's Stephen Gunnion, Day highlighted the effective water management strategies for the lower-contained aquifer, which revealed lower flow rates than expected, easing management efforts. This has been made possible by additional drilling, enhancing the company’s understanding of water flows and geological formations, which could shorten the path to the oil body.

Day also praised the working relationship with Newmont's Australian team, attributing much of the quarter's success to this collaboration. He noted the benefits of working with a global major, such as proactive resource ordering, which has kept operations ahead of schedule.

Regarding future plans, Day addressed Newmont's intention to divest its 70% joint venture interest in Havieron, viewing it as a potential opportunity for Greatland Gold. Despite the possibility of Newmont's exit, Day expressed confidence in Greatland Gold’s capacity to manage and develop its assets, suggesting a strong future for the company and its shareholders.
