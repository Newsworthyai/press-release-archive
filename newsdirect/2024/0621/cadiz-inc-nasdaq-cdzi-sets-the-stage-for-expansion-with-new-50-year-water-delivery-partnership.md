# Cadiz, Inc. (NASDAQ: CDZI) Sets the Stage for Expansion with New 50-Year Water Delivery Partnership

Water, the essence of life on Earth, remains a vital resource for survival and development. Despite significant improvements, challenges in providing access to clean water persist. Founded in 1983, Cadiz, Inc. (NASDAQ: CDZI) is dedicated to addressing these challenges through a comprehensive range of water solutions. With an extensive portfolio of assets and ongoing initiatives, Cadiz presents a compelling opportunity for potential investors.

Cadiz, Inc. is committed to delivering clean, reliable, and affordable water. The company's operations span 45,000 acres of land, 2.5 million acre-feet of water supply, and 220 miles of pipeline assets. Cadiz's business model integrates water supply, storage, pipelines, and treatment technologies to address the multifaceted impacts of climate change on water access.

Strategic Initiatives and Financial Stability

CDZI has undertaken several initiatives to enhance its market position. The company's acquisition of ATEC Water Systems, LLC, a leader in water filtration solutions, underscores its commitment to addressing groundwater contamination. ATEC has secured numerous contracts, including a $5.2 million project in Gresham, Oregon, to supply filters for manganese removal from local groundwater. This project is part of the Cascade Groundwater Alliance, aiming to reduce reliance on imported surface water and improve local water quality.

Cadiz's financial stability is reinforced by recent financing agreements. On March 15, 2024, the company secured a $41.2 million financing agreement with Heerema International Group Services BV, extending its debt maturity to 2027. This agreement provides additional liquidity to accelerate the development of water supply, pipeline, filtration, and storage assets. Further, a financing transaction led by Heerema International Group Services SA on April 25, 2024, bolstered Cadiz's financial position, supporting its growth strategy.

Key Projects and Partnerships

One of CDZI's flagship projects is the Solomon Hills development in partnership with Solstra Communities California LLC. This project aims to deliver 1,275 AFY of water from the Cadiz Water Supply and Storage Project to support the development of over 4,000 homes for military and working families along the Central California coast. This initiative highlights Cadiz's role in addressing California's urgent housing needs by providing sustainable water solutions.

CDZI is also engaged in partnerships to enhance water infrastructure in San Bernardino County's Mojave Basin region. Collaborating with Fenner Gap Mutual Water Company and the Victor Valley Wastewater Reclamation Authority, Cadiz aims to integrate recycled water from wastewater treatment plants to improve groundwater quality and supply efficiency.

Recent Developments and Partnerships

On June 20, 2024, Cadiz announced a definitive agreement with the Santa Margarita Water District (SMWD) to deliver water from the Cadiz Water Supply and Storage Project through the company's Northern Pipeline. This 50-year take-or-pay agreement, unanimously approved by SMWD's board of directors, signifies a major milestone for Cadiz. The agreement is expected to generate key revenue streams to support infrastructure financing for the pipeline project. Cadiz will deliver 5,000 acre-feet per year (AFY) to groundwater banks along the 220-mile pipeline in exchange for water that SMWD can obtain from State Water Contractors and local water suppliers. The price per acre-foot, inclusive of all costs, will not exceed $1,650.

Susan Kennedy, Chairman and CEO of CDZI, stated, "Santa Margarita's agreement to take delivery of water via the Northern Pipeline will help us meet an aggressive construction schedule to have the pipeline online in 2026." Frank Ury, an SMWD board member, emphasized the importance of diversifying water supply portfolios and reducing dependence on the Colorado River and State Water Project resources. This agreement enables SMWD to access up to 5,000 AFY from the Cadiz Project through the Northern Pipeline, enhancing regional water resilience without waiting for a new pipeline's construction.

Future Outlook

Cadiz's transformation from a land and water asset company to a prominent player in the global water industry positions it for significant growth. The company's vast aquifer system in the eastern Mojave Desert, estimated to hold 30-50 million acre-feet of water, provides a crucial water resource in a region facing severe water scarcity. By leveraging strategic infrastructure such as pipelines and right-of-ways, Cadiz is poised to operate one of the largest water banks in the world.

Cadiz is well-positioned for public partnerships and infrastructure projects. These initiatives aim to bolster water security and address the escalating demand for resilient water management solutions amid climate variability.

ConclusionCadiz, Inc. (NASDAQ: CDZI) stands at the forefront of the water solutions market, driving sustainability and growth through strategic initiatives and partnerships. The company's commitment to delivering clean, reliable water and addressing the evolving needs of communities and industries positions it as a compelling opportunity for potential investors. With a robust portfolio and a clear vision for the future, Cadiz is shaping the future of water management in a rapidly changing world.
