# HTX Steps Up Security Measures with Monthly Reports, Safeguarding User Assets on Full Steam

According to cyber security statistics, between January 2012 and February 2024, there have been 148 crypto exchange hacks, resulting in a total loss of over $11 billion. Recently, cyberattacks targeting exchange accounts have occurred more frequently, with increasing sophistication.

As part of its security efforts, the exchange has adopted Merkle tree proof of reserves and regularly discloses reserve data. This marks HTX one of the earliest movers in proving platform reserves. From the end of 2022 to the present, HTX has conducted a total of 20 Merkle tree reserve audits, maintaining a reserve ratio above 100% to ensure that users can safely deposit and fully withdraw assets at any time.

Looking ahead, HTX is poised to employ even higher financial standards to ensure the long-term security of user assets.
