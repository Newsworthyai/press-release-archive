# Zuma Payroll & Processing Makes the Inc. 5000 List of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies

Zuma Payroll & Processing (“Zuma”), a leading payroll, processing, and talent management software provider, today announced it was named to the 2024 Inc. 5000 annual list of the fastest-growing private companies in America. Inc. recognized Zuma for achieving a three-year revenue growth rate of 316 percent. It’s the third consecutive year that Zuma was named to the prestigious ranking of the most successful independent, entrepreneurial businesses in the United States.

Zuma helps small and medium businesses (SMBs) handle their complex payroll, tax, and human resources obligations more efficiently and effectively. In addition to revenue growth, the company has added new clients, experienced payroll and human capital professionals, and products to its business over the past twelve months.

“We're honored to be among America’s fastest-growing private companies again this year, having achieved more than 300 percent revenue growth for three consecutive years,” said Chris Caputo, CEO of Zuma. “Our growth is attributed to our relentless focus on serving our clients and delivering innovative solutions to meet their payroll, tax, and talent management needs. Our world-class team of experts are some of the most knowledgeable professionals in the payroll industry, and their dedication to exceptional client service can’t be beat.”

Zuma recently launched a Human Resources Support Services offering, providing a dedicated human resources expert to advise and consult to help its clients navigate workplace issues and complexities. That offering follows last year’s launch of its dedicated construction sector solution, which handles intricate union reporting requirements.

The Inc. 5000 class of 2024 represents companies that have driven rapid revenue growth while navigating inflationary pressure, rising capital costs, and seemingly intractable hiring challenges. This year’s Inc. 5000 companies have added 874,458 jobs to the economy over the past three years.

One of the greatest joys of my job is going through the Inc. 5000 list,” says Mike Hofman, who recently joined Inc. as editor-in-chief. “Congratulations to this year’s honorees, as well, for growing their businesses fast despite the economic disruption we all faced over the past three years, from supply chain woes to inflation to changes in the workforce.”
