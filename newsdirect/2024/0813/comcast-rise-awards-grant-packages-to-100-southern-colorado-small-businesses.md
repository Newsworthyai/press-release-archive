# COMCAST RISE AWARDS GRANT PACKAGES TO 100 SOUTHERN COLORADO SMALL BUSINESSES

Today, Comcast announced the 100 businesses in Southern Colorado that will receive comprehensive grant packages, which include business consultation services, educational resources, a $5,000 monetary grant, creative production, media schedule, and a technology makeover. Comcast RISE is committed to supporting the growth of all small businesses, while advancing the objectives of diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as community investment. The program was created to help businesses and their communities thrive, with a focus on economic growth.

The regions in this round included Atlanta, Houston, Jacksonville, Richmond, VA and Southern Colorado. A total of 100 grants per city, or 500 grants overall, were announced today and will be awarded in September 2024.

A sample of Southern Colorado grant recipients include:

· RAD Hostel, Colorado Springs

· ColorSplashPaintball, Pueblo

· The Walter Brewing Company, Pueblo

“RAD Hostel is all about creating an awesome Colorado experience for our guests. As our high ratings, awards, and guest reviews show, we are achieving our mission. However, we are lacking in getting the word out,” said Erin Welch, owner of RAD Hostel. “I'm honored and excited about being selected to receive this grant and I'm confident that with the marketing assistance and technology makeover, we can more effectively share the type of experience we offer, increase our occupancy, and ensure more happy guests have a RAD Colorado experience.”

“I purchased this paintball business in March of 2019, and it was flourishing until the pandemic hit. I had to use all my capital just to keep the doors open. My planned projects and dreams were put on hold,” said Rique Lucero, owner of ColorSplashPaintball. “Thanks to Comcast RISE, I now have an opportunity for a fresh start, and resources to grow my business.”

“Comcast is committed to supporting and empowering small businesses in our communities,” said J.D. Keller, senior vice president of Comcast’s Mountain West Region. “The Comcast RISE program will deliver innovative and impactful resources that will make a lasting impact on small businesses in Southern Colorado.”

Comcast RISE was created in November 2020 to help small businesses hardest hit by COVID-19, from bakeries and barber shops to childcare centers and cleaning services, by providing the grants needed to survive and recover.

The program has evolved from helping businesses survive the pandemic, to helping businesses and their communities thrive with a focus on economic growth.

Grant packages include:

COACHING SESSIONS - Business assessment and coaching that provide business owners with recommendations on how to help grow their businesses.

EDUCATION RESOURCES - 12-month access to online entrepreneurship courses, learning modules and resources for small business owners.

MONETARY GRANT - $5,000 monetary grant.

CREATIVE PRODUCTION & MEDIA – Professionally produced 30-second TV commercial, plus a media strategy consultation and a 180-day linear media schedule. (Taxes and other fees may apply for production and media services.)

TECHNOLOGY MAKEOVER - Computer equipment and Internet, Voice and Cybersecurity services for 12 months. (Taxes and other fees may apply for tech makeover services.)

In addition, any small business owner can visit the Comcast RISE destination on X1 featuring aggregated small business news, tips, insights, and more. X1 customers can say “Comcast RISE” into the voice remote.

Comcast RISE is part of Project UP, the company’s $1 billion commitment to advance digital equity through programs and community partnerships that connect people to the Internet, advance economic mobility and open doors for the next generation of innovators, entrepreneurs, storytellers and creators.
