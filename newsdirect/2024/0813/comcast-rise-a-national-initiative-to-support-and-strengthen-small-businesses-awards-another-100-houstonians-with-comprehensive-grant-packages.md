Today, Comcast announced the 100 businesses in the Greater Houston area that will receive comprehensive grant packages, which include business consultation services, educational resources, a $5,000 monetary grant, creative production, media schedule, and a technology makeover. The recipients are among more than 14,000 entrepreneurs nationwide who have been selected through the Comcast RISE program to date. Comcast RISE is committed to supporting the growth of all small businesses, while advancing the objectives of diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as community investment. The program was created to help businesses and their communities thrive, with a focus on economic growth.

The regions in this round included Atlanta, Houston, Jacksonville, Richmond, VA and southern Colorado. 100 grants per city, or 500 grants overall, were announced today and will be awarded in September 2024.

“I’m speechless. As a small business, this means the world to us,” said Nickey Ngo, owner of Red Circle Ice Cream. “We’re a small mom and pop ice cream shop, doing everything by ourselves. I feel like I won the lottery. Comcast RISE will help grow my business and keep up with the competition.”

“Supporting small businesses means investing in the heart of our communities,” said Loren Hudson, SVP and Chief Diversity Officer, Connectivity and Platforms, Comcast. “By empowering entrepreneurs and small business owners with the skills and resources they need to grow and succeed, we help ensure our local neighborhoods can flourish and thrive too.”

Comcast RISE was created in November 2020 to help small businesses hardest hit by COVID-19, from bakeries and barber shops to childcare centers and cleaning services, by providing the grants needed to survive and recover.

The program has evolved from helping businesses survive the pandemic, to helping businesses and their communities thrive with a focus on economic growth.

Grant packages include:

* COACHING SESSIONS - Business assessment and coaching that provide business owners with recommendations on how to help grow their businesses.
* EDUCATION RESOURCES - 12-month access to online entrepreneurship courses, learning modules and resources for small business owners.
* MONETARY GRANT - $5,000 monetary grant.
* CREATIVE PRODUCTION & MEDIA – Professionally produced 30-second TV commercial, plus a media strategy consultation and a 180-day linear media schedule. (Taxes and other fees may apply for production and media services.)
* TECHNOLOGY MAKEOVER - Computer equipment and Internet, Voice and Cybersecurity services for 12 months. (Taxes and other fees may apply for tech makeover services.)

In addition, any small business owner can visit the Comcast RISE destination on X1 featuring aggregated small business news, tips, insights, and more. X1 customers can say “Comcast RISE” into the voice remote.

Comcast RISE is part of Project UP, the company’s $1 billion commitment to advance digital equity through programs and community partnerships that connect people to the Internet, advance economic mobility and open doors for the next generation of innovators, entrepreneurs, storytellers and creators.
