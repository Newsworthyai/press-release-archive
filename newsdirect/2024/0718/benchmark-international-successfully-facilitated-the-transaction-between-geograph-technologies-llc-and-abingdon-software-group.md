Benchmark International has successfully facilitated a transaction between Easley, South Carolina-based GEOGRAPH Technologies, LLC (“GEOGRAPH”) and London, UK-based Abingdon Software Group (“Abingdon”). GEOGRAPH provides geographic information system (GIS) services utilizing a software extension for clients to manage fiber optic, copper, and coax networks.

“The Benchmark International's team understood GEOGRAPH’s high degree of differentiation from the very start, particularly around the company’s CrescentLink Esri extension and the connectivity this proprietary solution drives with the company’s impressive customer list,” commented Benchmark Senior Transaction Director William Sullivan. “GEOGRAPH faced no shortage of eager potential partners in this process, receiving strong interest immediately from a range of both strategic and capital partners. Ultimately, Abingdon’s differentiation was largely a function of cultural fit and a strong alignment of vision. All parties were a pleasure to work with, and we are excited about the opportunities that this combination will afford both the GEOGRAPH and Abingdon teams moving forward.”

Founded in 2018, GEOGRAPH serves over 150 customers and more than 1,000 users in the United States and in three international geographies. In addition to its CrescentLink technology, the company offers professional and support services, which include training and support, data migration, network planning and design, remote GIS management, and GIS consulting.

Abingdon Software Group acquires and develops a mission-critical platform designed for industries undergoing rapid digital transformation. The company’s portfolio offers applications for agriculture, shipping, healthcare, logistics, local authority, resorts, industry, and construction segments, enabling businesses to succeed in essential operations.
