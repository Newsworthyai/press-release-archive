Many men aim to improve their athletic performance, increase their energy, and sharpen their cognitive skills. Overall, men usually seek to sustain better moods, enhanced sexual health, and vitality. However, for many men over the age of 40, achieving these goals can be challenging due to low testosterone levels.

Low testosterone is a condition that impacts millions of men around the globe, with 2.9% of males over 40 and 3.75% of males over 60 being prescribed some form of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) to improve their libido, energy and mood. That represents a significant portion of the population, with others possibly needing the therapy but not yet using it. The market size for TRT is projected to reach $2.9 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 4.2%.

TRT Doesn't Need To Be A Pain In The ButtCurrently, available TRT treatments require several sessions of injections, applying messy gels and creams, or having pellets inserted under your skin, all of which can be uncomfortable, embarrassing, inconvenient and quite frankly, an all-out pain in the butt. MangoRx is looking to change the game and give men an alternative method to improve their health without all the discomfort.

Mangoceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGRX), a men’s health and wellness telemedicine company behind the popular erectile dysfunction pill Mango (think “Man-Go”), is shaking things up with a newly FDA-approved Oral Testosterone Replacement Therapy called Prime powered by Kyzatrex®.

Prime powered by Kyzatrex® is clinically proven to restore testosterone to healthy levels. Just two oral doses a day with food is as effective and less messy or painful than traditional creams or injections. The company says its lymphatic absorption pathway minimizes liver impact, and its formulation is not affected by dietary or alcohol intake, offering consistent absorption. So you get all of the gains without the pains.

Prime is one of the few drugs that can claim to be an oral testosterone replacement therapy. The company is marketing it to males who are on another form of TRT treatment including injectables or pellets and those experiencing common symptoms associated with low testosterone and seeking immediate TRT treatment.

And just like taking Prime, the ordering process is painless too. Prime requires a prescription, but obtaining it is straightforward through MangoRx’s easy-to-use telemedicine platform. After completing an online telehealth visit, one of its network of medical providers will review and determine the dosage and strength that is appropriate. Combined with a low price of $224/month, this uncomplicated process appeals to the product’s customer base, which is growing.

Additionally, Prime offers significant value to Mangoceuticals through strong customer retention and recurring revenues. Once men begin TRT, they tend to remain on it long-term, if not for life, which may provide consistent and predictable revenue streams for the company. Sales in MangoRx’s first quarter rose by 108%.

The Science Speaks For ItselfKYZATREX, the active ingredient in Prime, is a clinically tested oral testosterone, demonstrated to be up to 96% effective in restoring testosterone levels, reports MagonRx. In a six-month clinical trial of 139 men with low testosterone, 88% had healthy testosterone levels at day 90. The formula’s design provides a more balanced hormonal profile without the fluctuations typical of injectable therapies. Prime does not contribute to increased blood viscosity—a common issue with testosterone injections—thereby reducing the risk of erythrocytosis and eliminating the need for blood donation as part of treatment management, reports MangoRX.

The immediate oral testosterone undecanoate found in Prime offers additional specific benefits. Its convenient administration method eliminates the need for needles, messy creams, and frequent, sometimes painful, trips to the doctor. This non-invasive approach reduces the risk of infections and discomfort associated with injections. The oral formulation is absorbed via the lymphatic system, improving bioavailability and resulting in fewer liver issues compared to other oral testosterone forms.

It also provides stable hormone levels, which can lead to consistent testosterone levels with potentially less aromatization to estrogen, which historically, has been a concern of those seeking TRT. The flexible dosing allows for easier adjustments to meet individual needs. Enhanced well-being, muscle mass, and strength, improved bone density, and better libido and sexual function are among the many advantages, the company says.

Achieving Overall Vitality Beyond all the medical breakthroughs and innovative delivery systems, Prime checks all the boxes in achieving a better quality of life for men. According to MangoRX, Prime offers a range of benefits including increasing endurance, strength, energy levels, and overall physical capabilities.

The TRT also improves mood, reduces mood swings, improves mental clarity, and enhances focus and cognitive performance. On top of all that, Prime's formulation helps regulate and balance crucial hormone levels, offering holistic health benefits. By positively impacting testosterone levels, Prime contributes to a holistic approach to health, vitality, and overall well-being, the company says.

Low testosterone is a common condition that can be treated, although the options available today can be uncomfortable. Prime changes that with the first oral treatment. For men looking to step up their game, there's a new player in town who is delivering.
