In addition to traditional testing, RevolutionaryMD offers genomic panels, advanced cardiovascular and cancer screening, inflammatory, and nutritional testing. It also employs AI for precise, personalized recommendations, moving beyond the depersonalized, often suboptimal outcomes of standard allopathic medicine.

RevolutionaryMD has pioneered the concierge approach of functional medicine, advancing personalized healthcare with the latest treatments in:

1. Anti-Aging and Regenerative Medicine for Improved Healthspan and Lifespan
2. Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy and Restoration
3. Sexual Health and Wellness
4. Aesthetic Dermatology
5. Mind and Body Balancing Through Brain Health Modalities
6. Integrated Ketamine and Sound Therapy for Depression
7. IV Therapy for Post-COVID Syndrome, Inflammation and Healthy Mitochondrial Function

Dr. Grover's dedication to functional and integrative medicine is evident in his role as an assistant clinical professor at the University of Colorado, Denver, his Board Certifications in Anti-Aging and Integrative Holistic Medicine, and his authorship of "Spiritual Genomics" and "Awakening Gaia."
