# LeadStar Marketplace Unleashes Groundbreaking Enhancements to Its Lead-Generation Platform

LeadStar Marketplace, the proprietary, private leads platform created exclusively for AmeriLife-affiliated agents, announced today the launch of LeadStar 2.0, which features significant enhancements to its robust platform, designed to revolutionize how licensed insurance agents acquire quality leads for consumers seeking Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Affordable Care Act (ACA), and Final Expense (FE) insurance coverage. LeadStar 2.0 is available immediately to all existing customers.

In collaboration with its customer base and affiliated health agencies, the LeadStar team has listened to what sales professionals value in today’s lead generation landscape, resulting in the upgraded LeadStar 2.0 platform. The platform’s enhanced approach to supplying leads features an extended lead catalog, multi-media channel capabilities, and advanced optimization technologies to set a new standard for lead generation efficiency and effectiveness.

“At LeadStar, we are dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in lead generation,” said William DeCourcy, Chief Lead Generation Officer for AmeriLife. “These enhancements are a testament to our ongoing efforts to innovate and improve our services. We believe the new features will empower our clients to succeed even more in their marketing and sales endeavors.”

The enhanced LeadStar 2.0 platform is designed to meet the demands of the evolving health and life insurance marketplace, ensuring licensed agents connect with the right prospects more efficiently than before.

Extended Lead Catalog

The extended lead catalog allows users to diversify and target a more comprehensive network of potential customers across various multimedia platforms and demographics. This expansion means agents can connect with the right prospects at the right time, which should dramatically increase conversion rates. LeadStar 2.0’s expansion targets social media, inbounds, direct mail, and transfers with real-time data across Medicare, MA, ACA, and FE. This deeper level of marketing funnel visibility offers more substantial visibility to each lead by understanding their customer journey before the sales process begins.

Expanded Multimedia Channel Supply

LeadStar 2.0 integrates a wealth of multi-media channel leads into its platform. Agents can now connect with potential customers through multiple touchpoints, including social media, email, and mobile, all within a unified system tailored to meet specific needs or strategies. This holistic approach streamlines the lead generation process, enhances user engagement and interaction, and aims to provide the lowest CPA possible.

More Substantial Lead Delivery

Moreover, LeadStar 2.0 introduces enhanced optimization capabilities to its platform. Advanced algorithms and machine learning power the platform and offer more intelligent lead matching and predictive lead scoring. These features ensure clients receive relevant and high-potential leads, reducing the time and effort they will spend on lead qualification and follow-up.
