Lake Como, Italy, July 18th, 2024 - (500NewsWire) --  Ahead of the start of the 24/25 Serie A Femminile Ebay season, F.C. Como Women, Mercury/13’s inaugural portfolio club, is thrilled to unveil its new brand identity. This game-changing rebranding effort, led by Communion Studio, aims to build F.C. Como Women into the world’s preeminent premium brand with a mission to captivate and inspire a global female audience.

A New Era in Women’s Football

Building a brand that transcends football and articulating a shared mindset that is easy to relate to, was fundamental. Being a woman playing professional football is a brave, and often impossible accomplishment of its own, and we believe it should be a symbol of resilience, celebration and acknowledgment of ambitious women aiming to achieve the impossible in other arenas, too.

“This exciting brand unveil is in line with Mercury/13’s mission to bring football to the other half of the world,” said Victoire Cogevina Reynal, co-founder and co-CEO of the club’s parent company. “I grew up loving football, but never felt it was built for me. A century later in football, this new brand is purpose-built for us. I hope the FCCW crest becomes a global emblem representative of the unimaginable things we can achieve as women despite the odds being stacked against us. Our players are a daily reminder of this, this club is a daily reminder of this… it's ultimately a shared feeling that transcends football”.

From its inception, Mercury/13 proposed an innovative approach that breaks all the rules of a traditional football club. Women playing at the highest level of professional football begs for a fresh approach, and a tailored strategy. The new brand identity is designed to resonate with a female audience that values gender equality, acknowledging and celebrating a world where women are empowered.

Andy Harvey, co-founder of Communion Studio: “F.C. Como Women is a project we instantly wanted to work on, the ambitions and energy to make tangible change were so clear. We embraced the challenge of intentionally expanding the audience for football in one of the most fanatical parts of the world for the men's game by creating a brand that had crossover appeal, at home in Como, and in wardrobes of cool people following the club from anywhere.”

The New Brand Identity

“The new identity intentionally breaks from the past, and without a legacy, we become free to design a brand that only looks forward,” states Nancy Hensley who led the project for Mercury/13. New codes for a new chapter in the Women’s game. The colours were purposefully brought back to white and black, to purify and step away from the patterns and stripes that other Italian teams often adopt.

The crest was inspired by conversations about the power of timeless monograms and symbols. Details in the design reference reflections on the lake and the textile weaving that the region is known for.

Inspired by the storied past and iconic status of our home city of Como, F.C. Como Women stands as one of the only independent clubs in the Italian top flight. From our bold, fashion-inspired monogram to our classic block monochrome colours, our design dares to be different, creating new visual codes for the women's game.

Brand Truths

* We play with heart and humility. Our players deliver passion-fueled performances with an uncharacteristic humility that is rare in professional athletes.
* An underdog with main character energy. Every time we step on a field, we are by definition the challenger, but that doesn’t stop us from showing up ready to fight for our spot.
* We are legacy-makers carving our own path. In a league filled with century-old football heritage, we proudly represent the future of the women’s game, redefining what's possible every day.
* Our dreams transcend football. This is more than just a football club; it’s a symbol of recognition and celebration of women who dare to do the impossible.

The Power of Partnership

We are big believers in building partnerships where we see a natural alignment of values. As one of the only women’s football clubs in Italy, we represent the future and want to build on an ambitious vision that has been resonating with many potential sponsors (national and international). We have thoughtfully approached the market with a new perspective seeking founding partners, not just sponsors - structuring our commercial packages to reflect this new model.

Brands that have been a natural fit are predominantly in the beauty and fashion realm, a sector that has only recently seen the opportunity in women’s sports. These sectors have historically serve a female audience, and through this type of partnership they see an opportunity to walk the talk by empowering women on a whole other level.

Later this summer we will be announcing our technical sponsor and several other partners that have already committed to the club, in search for a brighter, better future.

To our fans, old and new

Starting this month, fans will encounter a new website and redesigned social media channels that reflect this new identity. For more information, please visit our website at www.comowomen.it or contact us at press@mercury13.com
