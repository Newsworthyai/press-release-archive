# Investments & Wealth Academy Wins “Best in Industry Association” in the WealthManagement.com 2024 Wealthie Awards

Investments & Wealth Institute (“the Institute”), the premier professional membership association, education provider, and credentialing body for financial service professionals and advisors serving high-net-worth clients, has been recognized as the winner of the Industry Association category in the WealthManagement.com 2024 Industry Awards (the "Wealthies") for its premier online learning platform, the Investments & Wealth Academy. This award underscores the Institute’s commitment to continually informing the expertise and strengthening the credentials of those who shape the future of finance.

The Institute launched the Academy in November 2023 to enhance the multi-modal educational programs offered by the Institute. Designed to elevate the learning experience for both seasoned and NextGen advisors using universal design best practices, the Academy acts as a one-of-a-kind learning platform that provides access to short-form (on-demand webinars, microcourses, etc.) and long-form (short courses, “best of” bundles, certificate programs, etc.) content. This diversity of offerings helps advisors learn what they want to, when they want to, and how they want to.

“We’re honored to receive this prestigious award from WealthManagement.com,” said Sean Walters, CAE®, CEO of the Institute. “Led by Chief Learning Officer, Ross Riskin, our online education team has built a contemporary learning platform that is truly a “best-in-class” experience. Academy serves advisors of all ages and skill levels who are looking for timely, relevant, academically sound content with practical application.”

Now in its 10th year, the WealthManagement.com Industry Awards is the only awards program of its kind to honor outstanding achievements by companies, organizations and individuals that support financial advisor success.

"A record-breaking number of nominations were submitted in 2024, with over 1,000 entries received from more than 400 companies," said David Armstrong, Director of Editorial Strategy and Operations, Wealth Management Group – Informa Connect. "The Industry Awards program has significantly expanded in scope in the ten years since it began, but the mission remains the same: To recognize and celebrate the outstanding initiatives undertaken by companies and individuals that contribute to the success of financial advisors in their businesses and foster improved outcomes for their clients."

The Institute was selected as the Industry Association winner by a panel of independent judges made up of industry leaders who evaluated finalist initiatives based on quantitative (e.g., scope, scale, adoption, and feature set) and qualitative (innovation, creativity, and new methods of delivery) measures.
