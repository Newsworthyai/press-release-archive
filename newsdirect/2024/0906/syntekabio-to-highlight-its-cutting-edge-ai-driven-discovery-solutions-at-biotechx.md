# Syntekabio to Highlight its Cutting-edge AI-driven Discovery Solutions at BioTechX

Syntekabio (KOSDAQ: 226330), an artificial intelligence (AI) based drug development company, today announced its participation at BioTechX USA, being held September 17-18, 2024 in Philadelphia, PA. Syntekabio is the Title Sponsor for the event and will give a keynote address and in-depth talk on its AI-driven solutions, as well as host a booth.

“We look forward to meeting with potential clients at BioTechX and discussing how our AI-driven technologies can improve and accelerate their R&D activities,” said Jongsun Jung, PhD, CEO of Syntekabio. “We recently announced our ‘Develop Now, Pay Later’ offer that enables clients to test the validity of a target protein of interest without incurring any upfront costs. In addition to identifying potential hits and optimizing small molecule leads, we also have strong capabilities in antibody and cancer neoantigen discovery. We are excited to have the opportunity to highlight these technologies at the conference.”

Recently announced Develop Now, Pay Later offer – drug discovery with no upfront fees

Syntekabio’s Develop Now, Pay Later model enables pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to test the validity of a target protein of interest without incurring any upfront costs. Should a project demonstrate viability, Syntekabio then employs its STB LaunchPad program, powered by its proprietary AI-driven DeepMatcher® technology platform, to deliver hits and optimized leads as well as IND-enabled candidates. The client only pays for the work once the agreed upon validated results are obtained. For more information about Syntekabio, STB LaunchPad and Develop Now, Pay Later, please click here.

Additional powerful tools enable novel antibody and cancer neoantigen prediction

Additionally, the company will highlight its in silico biologics platforms, Neo-ARSTM and Ab-ARSTM, which enable personalized or universal neoantigen cancer vaccine and novel antibody drug prediction, respectively. These cutting-edge solutions address complex challenges in drug discovery, equipping researchers with powerful tools to develop novel and effective therapeutics.

Syntekabio’s AI accesses over 10 billion known compounds as well as 1,400 in vitro/in vivo compatible drug targets covering over 70% of human diseases. This technology is powered by Syntekabio’s AI Bio-Supercom Center, which houses an immense infrastructure of 5,000 servers, 40,000 CPU cores, and 2,500 GPUs fueling the Company’s algorithms. The Company has a comprehensive suite of advanced proprietary tools designed to accelerate the drug discovery and development process.
