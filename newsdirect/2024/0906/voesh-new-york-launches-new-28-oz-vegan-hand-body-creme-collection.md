# VOESH New York Launches New 28 oz. Vegan Hand & Body Crème Collection

VOESH New York is debuting a new 28 oz. Vegan Hand & Body Crème Collection, created to provide salon clients with a luxurious and healthier hydration experience. These larger bottles offer the same high-quality, vegan-friendly ingredients that have established VOESH as a leader in the body care industry.

“We’re thrilled about the addition of these generously sized lotions to VOESH’s product line,” said Tom Harrison, Principal of Coleman Harrison. “VOESH consistently outshines the competition with expert formulas. This new size will undoubtedly enhance manicure and pedicure services, delivering superior results for both clients and technicians.”

“As a bonus, technicians can pair these lotions with VOESH’s best-selling Pedi in a Box products,” added Kendall Stone, Principal of Jay Stone Sales.

Enriched with 94+% natural-origin ingredients, VOESH’s 28 oz. crèmes are formulated with organic virgin olive oil and natural extracts. They are infused with 100% vegan, clean, and certified organic components and are free from parabens, phthalates, gluten, mineral oil, and more than 1,680 other potentially harmful substances. The velvety texture provides long-lasting moisture and a radiant glow without a greasy feel. These larger bottles not only provide a superior experience but also ensure lasting hydration and value.

“Our lotions have always been a best-seller, so we’ve brought them back in a more convenient size for salons,” said Joseph Choi, Co-Founder of VOESH New York. “Salon owners have been asking for our popular massage butter in a bottle, and we’re ecstatic to fulfill this request.”

The new collection is available in five delightful scents: Olive Sensation, Lavender Relieve, Vitamin Recharge, Jasmine Soothe, and Green Tea Detox. Each scent is made with premium, IFRA-certified fragrances that pair perfectly with VOESH’s best-selling Pedi in a Box Deluxe 4 Step pedicure kits. This allows for a cohesive pampering experience that caters to clients’ preferences.

With a transparent ingredient list, dermatologist testing, and U.S. FDA registration, VOESH’s new 28 oz. Vegan Hand & Body Crèmes are the best addition to guarantee clients and technicians feel good about what goes on their skin.
