# Recce Pharmaceuticals completes global patent portfolio

--News Direct--

Recce Pharmaceuticals Ltd (ASX:RCE) CEO James Graham joins Proactive’s Jonathan Jackson to talk through the formal granting of a new Patent Family 2 by the China National Intellectual Property Administration. The patent, titled 'Copolymer and Method for Treatment of Bacterial Infection', covers RECCE® 327 (R327) and RECCE® 529 (R529). These compounds are used in the treatment of a wide range of common human infections, with the patent including claims related to methods of manufacture, administration and application. The patent is set to expire in 2035. This marks the completion of Recce's portfolio of wholly-owned Family 2 Patents, ensuring that the company is patent-protected in all major global pharmaceutical markets, including China, Australia, the USA, Europe (specifically Germany, Spain, France, the UK, Italy and Sweden) and Japan. All these patents are due to expire in 2035. Graham expressed gratitude towards the China National Intellectual Property Administration and emphasised the global coverage this patent secures. China, recognised as the world's second-largest pharmaceutical market, has shown consistent growth. In 2021, the market was valued at approximately US$140 billion, with a growth rate of around 3.2% in 2023. The growth is expected to continue, propelled by increasing demand, healthcare reforms, and government support for pharmaceutical R&D.
