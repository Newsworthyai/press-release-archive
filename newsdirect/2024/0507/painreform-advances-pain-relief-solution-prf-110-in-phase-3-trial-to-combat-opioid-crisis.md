# PainReform Advances Pain Relief Solution, PRF-110, in Phase 3 Trial to Combat Opioid Crisis

--News Direct--

PainReform CEO Ilan Hadar joined Steve Darling from Proactive to discuss the company at the forefront of addressing the opioid crisis in the United States, is developing PRF-110, an innovative post-operative pain treatment designed as an alternative to traditional opioids. PRF-110 is applied directly by surgeons during procedures, offering patients up to 72 hours of continuous pain relief, potentially eliminating the need for additional pain medications post-surgery.

The company is currently advancing a Phase III study in Texas to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of PRF-110. The study, which began in October 2023, has already seen significant progress with more than 50% of the target 400 patients enrolled. Completion of patient enrollment is expected by mid-year, and the study results are anticipated in the third quarter of the same year. A successful outcome from this study could pave the way for another Phase III trial focusing on soft tissue applications, slated to start in early 2025, with results expected by 2026.

Should the upcoming trials confirm PRF-110â€™s efficacy and safety, PainReform plans to submit a New Drug Application in 2026. The company recognizes the significant market potential for non-opioid post-operative pain treatments, an area currently underexplored, and is positioning PRF-110 as a key player in transforming pain management practices post-surgery.
