# Skye Bioscience Moves to Nasdaq, Hits Milestone in Clinical Program

--News Direct--

Skye Bioscience CEO Punit Dhillon joined Steve Darling from Proactive to share news announcing the company's uplisting of its common stock to the Nasdaq stock exchange, trading under the ticker symbol "SKYE." This achievement signifies a significant milestone for the company, reflecting advancements in its Phase 2 clinical programs, financial position, and shareholder base.

Dhillon further disclosed that Skye Bioscience reached another critical milestone by successfully dosing 56 patients with SBI-100 Ophthalmic Emulsion in its Phase 2a study and completing final study visits for all participants. SBI-100 OE, a cannabinoid receptor type 1 agonist administered topically to the eye, is designed to address the unmet needs of patients with elevated intraocular pressure related to primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

Notably, all treated patients completed the study without early discontinuations due to adverse events, demonstrating the safety profile of SBI-100 OE. The company anticipates releasing topline data for the entire study in the second quarter, marking a significant milestone in advancing its clinical program.

Skye Bioscience's move to the Nasdaq exchange underscores its commitment to enhancing visibility, expanding its investor base, and unlocking value for shareholders as it progresses in its mission to develop innovative therapies for ocular diseases.
