# StreamLayer and Kaizen Partner to Transform the Betting Experience

--News Direct--

StreamLayer, an audience engagement technology company focused on transforming the live sports viewing experience across mobile devices and CTVs, is bringing interactive viewing to Kaizen bettors worldwide. The partnership extends across 12 countries on three continents, accommodates seven different languages, and is already delivering impressive results.

StreamLayer’s next-generation video engagement and monetization solution enables streaming platforms—including media companies, leagues, and increasingly, sportsbooks—to transform their live content into highly engaging interactive viewing experiences. This innovation drives subscriber growth, reduces churn, and significantly expands monetizable opportunities.

Having been utilized during some of the largest live-streamed sporting events on record, StreamLayer’s technology consistently generates substantial boosts in viewing times and other key engagement metrics. Now, for the first time, StreamLayer and Kaizen are leveraging this technology to give sports bettors compelling reasons to stay engaged on their apps during live games, thereby increasing user sessions and, consequently, overall handle.

"Until now, sportsbooks have struggled to retain users in their apps once the game begins, missing out on a tremendous monetization opportunity between the kickoff and final whistle," said John Ganschow, CEO of StreamLayer. “Kaizen has been at the forefront of addressing this challenge, so we’re incredibly proud to partner with them and bring our proven technology to the betting industry for the first time.”

StreamLayer is headquartered in Chicago, IL.
