# American Aires Inc. Executing a Strategy To Increase Exposure And Drive Sales

--News Direct--

In our modern, technologically driven world, the proliferation of electronic devices emitting electromagnetic fields (EMFs) has raised significant concerns. While these EMFs have undoubtedly improved our lives in terms of convenience and connectivity, they also pose unintended health consequences. Scientific studies have shown that EMF radiation exposure can lead to brain inflammation, tissue damage, and the development of various diseases, including neurodegenerative conditions. This correlation between brain electrical activity and cognitive function underscores the potential risks of prolonged EMF exposure.

Pioneering Protection

Canadian-based nanotechnology company American Aires Inc. (CSE: WIFI) (OTC: AAIRF) has emerged as a pioneer in addressing the harmful effects of EMF radiation. With over 20 years of dedication and at least $20 million invested in research and development, American Aires has developed cutting-edge solutions to mitigate EMF exposure and optimize human health.

The cornerstone of American Aires' technology is its proprietary silicon-based resonator, designed to protect against EMF radiation. Unlike traditional methods that aim to block or absorb radiation, American Aires' technology actively modulates EMFs, creating a protective barrier around electronic devices. These sleek and stylish devices provide personal and area protection without the need for a power source, targeting EMR emitted by various consumer electronic devices, including cellphones, computers, baby monitors, and Wi-Fi, including high-speed 5G networks.

Scientific Validation

The effectiveness of American Aires' microchip in reducing the harmful effects of EMF radiation has been reaffirmed by the scientific community. A recently published study in the Link Journal confirmed the chip's stabilizing capabilities, supported by eight peer-reviewed studies and 25 clinical and scientific reports, validating the technology. This scientific validation underscores the credibility and reliability of American Aires' solutions in the EMF protection space.

Recent Exposure

The groundwork for the Rumble partnership began over the past year, with AAIRF and RUM working together to test the traffic and conversion performance of the video platform. This collaboration paved the way for American Aires to officially launch a pilot test consisting of a paid ad campaign on Rumble.

As part of this campaign, one of Rumble's most popular influencers, English comedian, actor, and influencer Russell Brand, with 1.87 million followers on the platform, will read one Aires ad per week over multiple episodes of his show on Rumble. Additionally, Rumble will display pre-roll "run of network" ad placements before or after Brand's shows air during the campaign.

Commenting on the significance of this collaboration, American Aires CEO Josh Bruni stated, "It's very significant that this test campaign features Russell Brand. He not only aligns well with the Aires brand but also has a growing global audience through Rumble and across other media platforms that can reach potential Aires customers around the world."
