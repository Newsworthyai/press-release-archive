# VOESH New York to Launch Innovative Body Roller Crème Line for Every Body

--News Direct--

VOESH New York, the leading clean and vegan body care and wellness brand, is excited to announce the upcoming launch of its innovative Body Roller Crème line, designed to revolutionize at-home body care routines. These groundbreaking products, Tone’d and Smooth’d, combine a clean formula with stimulating massage rollers for a superior DIY lymphatic massage experience. Created with 100% vegan ingredients, including 2% caffeine, proprietary vegan probiotics, and a powerful detoxifying blend, the Body Roller Crèmes not only promote relaxation, but also address specific concerns like cellulite and aging skin.

"Our mission at VOESH New York has always been to provide ultimate body care solutions that prioritize both physical and mental well-being," shared Vera Oh, Co-Founder of VOESH New York. "Self-care is essential for body confidence, which is why we’ve designed our Body Roller Crèmes to help consumers look and feel their best at any stage of life.”

With 2% caffeine, these formulas work together with the massage rollers to help reduce the appearance of cellulite by improving circulation and targeting the body’s fat cells. Additionally, the proprietary vegan probiotics strengthen and protect the skin's barrier, while the detox blend eliminates impurities, resulting in smoother, firmer skin over time.

"We're excited to introduce this groundbreaking addition to our retailers," said Jeff Harper, Vice President at Harper Group. "VOESH has a reputation for delivering clean, vegan skincare solutions, and the Body Roller Crème line will undoubtedly enhance self-care routines for consumers."

Monica Loving, Vice President at Ivystone Group, echoed this sentiment, stating, "VOESH is synonymous with clean, sustainable self-care. These innovative products will be a welcome addition to our retail partners, offering customers effective solutions with a conscious ethos."

With a commitment to clean, sustainable, and ethically-sourced vegan spa care, VOESH New York continues to lead the industry in providing innovative solutions for better beauty. "Together, with our loyal customers and retail partners, we've transformed the spa and beauty sectors over the past decade," said Vera Oh. "With the Body Roller Crème line, we're taking our mission to innovate and elevate self-care even further, setting new standards for clean beauty."
