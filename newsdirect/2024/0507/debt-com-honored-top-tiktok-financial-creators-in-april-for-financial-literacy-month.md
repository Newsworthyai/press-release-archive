While TikTok enthusiasts convene at the Capitol in Washington and lawmakers strive to enact a nationwide ban on the beloved app, Debt.com is focusing on acknowledging and honoring the finest financial content creators.

The subset of the app known as #FinTok has more than 4.5 billion views and is a popular outlet for advice. The dark side is that it contains misleading information that could land people in financial or legal trouble. For the second year in a row to help filter through the noise, Debt.com recognizes creators providing practical and actionable financial guidance.

“The FinTok Awards shines a spotlight on the valuable contributions of creators who empower users with trustworthy financial guidance in an increasingly digital world”. “Unlike many other award programs, there are no fees associated with being nominated. Our award program is solely talent and knowledge based.”

Don Silvestri

President of Debt.com

One of last year’s winners, Markia Brown, AFC from @theMoneyPlug says “Winning the award from a well-known and respected organization such as Debt.com showed me and the world that my dedication to providing accessible credit literacy content makes a difference, and that accurate and accessible financial literacy content can be found online.”

Brown extolled, “I make a difference. That award inspired me to expand my knowledge beyond credit, and a few months later, I earned my Accredited Financial Counselor designation through the Association for Financial Counseling & Planning Education®.”
