# FAYE DUNAWAY WRAPS FILMING ON JONATHAN BAKER’S ‘FATE THE MOVIE’ AHEAD OF
CELEBRATORY MOMENT AT CANNES FOR HER HBO DOCUMENTARY ‘FAYE’

--News Direct--

Baker Entertainment Group, a film production company led by

visionary filmmaker Jonathan Baker, has announced Janet Montgomery as a young Faye Dunaway in

“Fate The Movie”. Dunaway has just wrapped her role as Tilly, which spans an entire lifetime, bridging

the character to life by the talents of both Dunaway and Montgomery into one central character. While

the film is still in production, this marks a significant milestone in her legendary career as Dunaway

heads to Cannes to screen her celebratory HBO documentary “Faye”. Highland Film Group will be on

the ground selling “Fate The Movie” from writer-producer-director Jonathan Baker, making this his

second to last film he’ll ever create.

Janet Montgomery, playing Young Tilly, was cast out of hundreds of actors for this role. “She stepped

in with beauty, love, and laughter to play a strong sophisticated soul which will illuminate the film.

Once Janet listened to the music of the movie, Nessun Dorma, Nat King Cole's ‘Unforgettable’, and

our original song “forever is yesterday” by singer songwriter Trease,” said Baker. “Out of all our cast

members, Janet has worked the hardest to embody and challenge her character through Faye

Dunaway and into her original performance of Young TIlly. Everyone is a muse in this movie for me as

I step into every character as I bring them to life. With Janet's background and chemistry with

Brandon Routh, this is an epic love story that will live on forever.”

“I think he’s one of the important directors that we’re watching today. And I think it’s a really interesting

film. He’s got a great cast, it’s an amazing script, and what drew me to the film is we’re all in a holistic

retreat so that means maybe we’re not all there at the same time and it’s interesting from that point of

view. I like him very much. And I'm glad to be in this film with him,” said Faye Dunaway in an interview

with Vancouver Sun.

Jonathan Baker stated, “Faye Dunaway is one of the greatest actors of our time. When I crafted her

role in the film “Fate”, I could see no one else that could play that part better than her. With such

respect and admiration, I had the pleasure to experience the brilliant performance of Faye Dunaway

alongside Harvey Keitel in my film.”

Synopsis: It takes a minute to find a special person and an entire lifetime to forget them. After a

rescue mission gone wrong, a firefighter Sam Ellis (Brandon Routh) connects with a stranger from the

past Tilly (Janet Montgomery) while he's healing at a rehabilitation center and is transported through

time to find the only thing saving his soul, is his realization of true love.

Jonathan Baker is producing “Fate The Movie” after being in development for five years, bringing a

singular ambition and passion to creating this feature film.
