# Sarytogan Graphite USPG batteries retain 97.3% capacity after 100 cycles

Sarytogan Graphite Ltd (ASX: SGA) managing director Sean Gregory joins Jonathan Jackson in the Proactive studio to discuss the exceptional endurance demonstrated in its lithium-ion batteries using Sarytogan Uncoated Spherical Purified Graphite (USPG). The coin-cell batteries have undergone more than 140 charge-discharge cycles, retaining 97.3% capacity after 100 cycles. This suggests the potential for up to 1,000 cycles before reaching the 80% capacity threshold. Initial tests on Coated Spherical Purified Graphite (CSPG) batteries will be reported shortly. These results are crucial inputs for the pre-feasibility study, scheduled for completion in Q3 2024. Sarytoganâ€™s graphite anodes benefit from highly crystalline graphite, enhancing lithium-ion intercalation. The USPG batteries, developed with an American technology partner, outperform many synthetic graphite products. The CSPG, produced by surface coating USPG, aims to further improve performance. Finally, Gregory talks about the associated costs, which are low and will be reported in the coming pre-feasibility study.
