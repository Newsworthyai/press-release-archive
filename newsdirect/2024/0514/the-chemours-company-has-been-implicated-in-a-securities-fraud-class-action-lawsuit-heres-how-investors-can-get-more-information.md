The Chemours Company (NYSE: CC) has been under scrutiny for a securities fraud class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The action, Taylor Jr. v. The Chemours Company, et al. affects anyone who purchased or acquired Chemours common stock between February 10, 2023, and February 28, 2024.

Chemours, a chemical company, is accused of engaging in misconduct related to its financial reporting. The company claimed to have generated strong Free Cash Flow for the fourth quarter of 2022 and the full year of 2022, which is the amount of cash a company has available after accounting for operational expenses and investments in property and equipment. Chemours reported its Free Cash Flow figures and its CEO and CFO certified the accuracy of the numbers. Chemours also set criteria for executive compensation based on financial targets, including Free Cash Flow targets. Senior executive officers, including the CEO and CFO, were entitled to additional cash compensation and stock-based compensation if these targets were met.

However, on February 13, 2024, Chemours announced a delay in releasing its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. The company cited the need for additional time to complete its reporting process and evaluate its internal control over financial reporting. It also revealed that an internal review was being conducted by the audit committee.

As a result of this announcement, the stock price of Chemours fell by over 12%. Then, on February 29, 2024, Chemours further shocked investors by announcing that its CEO, CFO and principal accounting officer were placed on administrative leave. The company disclosed that the investigation involved processes for reviewing reports made to the company's Ethics Hotline and practices for managing working capital, including their impact on incentive plans and certain financial metrics.

Following this revelation, the stock price of Chemours plummeted by more than 31% to the price of $28.72 per share. On March 6, 2024, Chemours announced that the audit committee found evidence that senior management had deliberately delayed payments to vendors and accelerated the collection of receivables to meet Free Cash Flow targets and incentive compensation metrics. Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against The Chemours Company based on the admission of the senior management’s securities fraud.

Here’s How Investors With Losses Can Find Out More Information About Their Rights Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP, located in Radnor, Pennsylvania, has earned a reputation for prosecuting class actions in state and federal courts throughout the U.S. and globally. It has successfully recovered billions of dollars for victims of fraud and other corporate misconduct. The firm is encouraging Chemours investors who have suffered significant losses to directly contact the firm for more information.

To potentially qualify as a lead plaintiff in the Chemours class action lawsuit, investors must take action no later than May 20, 2024. They can move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff either through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP, or other legal counsel. Alternatively, investors can choose to do nothing and remain as absent class members.

A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in the litigation. This individual or small group of investors typically has the largest financial interest and is considered adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff also selects legal counsel to represent both the lead plaintiff and the class. If the court approves these attorneys, they become lead or class counsel. Applying to become a lead plaintiff does not affect an investor's ability to share in any recovery from the lawsuit.
