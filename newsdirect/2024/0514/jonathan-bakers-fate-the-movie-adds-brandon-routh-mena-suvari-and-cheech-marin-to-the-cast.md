--News Direct--

Los Angeles, CA (May 13, 2024) - Baker Entertainment Group, a film production company led by

visionary filmmaker Jonathan Baker, has announced the latest key additions to its ensemble cast for the

upcoming feature "Fate The Movie", including Brandon Routh (“Superman Returns”, “DC’s Legends of

Tomorrow”), Mena Suvari (“Grace and Grit”, “American Beauty”), and Cheech Marin (“Cheech & Chong”,

“From Dusk Till Dawn”). Production is underway in Vancouver with previously announced actors Academy

Award-winner Faye Dunaway (“Bonnie & Clyde”, “Chinatown,” “Network”), Academy Award-nominee

Harvey Keitel (“Bugsy”, "Reservoir Dogs", “Taxi Driver”), and Actor, Director, Writer, Andrew McCarthy

(“The Blacklist,” “Orange is the New Black” and the upcoming documentary “Brats”). Highland Film Group

is handling international rights, launching sales at the Marché du Cannes.

“We’re honored to welcome Brandon Routh, Mena Suvari, and Cheech Marin to our extraordinary cast on

“Fate The Movie”, which is going to be the second to last film I ever make,” said Jonathan Baker,

producer, writer and director. “Their collective talent, along with the esteemed contributions of Hollywood

Legends Faye Dunaway, Harvey Keitel, and Andrew McCarthy, adds immense depth to our film. With this

dream cast, we’re thrilled to bring this epic love story to life in an unforgettable way.”

Enthralled by smart storytelling and larger-than-life figures, “Fate The Movie” has secured the rights to

Nat King Cole and his hit ‘Unforgettable’, acting as the north star in the film. The music partnership

between Baker Entertainment Group and the Nat King Cole Foundation plays a large part of the film by

portraying a new “character” on the project. “'Unforgettable' is not just a song in our film; it's a beacon,

guiding audiences through the emotional journey of the film. I'm honored to have the Foundation's

endorsement, and I look forward to paying tribute to him through the film”.

Synopsis: It takes a minute to find a special person and an entire lifetime to forget them. After a rescue

mission gone wrong, a firefighter Sam Ellis (Brandon Routh) connects with a stranger from the past Tilly,

while he's healing at a rehabilitation center and is transported through time to find the only thing saving

his soul, is his realization of true love.

Leading the cast in “Fate The Movie” is Superman himself Brandon Routh, continuing his excellent run of

recent projects. Routh was handpicked from hundreds of actors and Jonathan was passionate from the

beginning that Brandon was the only actor who could bring this role to life. “His dashing good looks,

comedic timing, and charm are unmatched. Brandon will help connect audiences to the story of ‘Fate The

Movie’ as the world falls in love with him and our movie,” said Jonathan Baker.

In Mena, Jonathan was inspired by “Grace & Grit”, blown away by her range and instincts as an actor.

“Her complicated character, and the emotional undertaking required for such a key role could only be

achieved by someone of Mena’s stature and experience.” Jonathan is also excited to welcome the iconic

Cheech Marin as a pivotal character, drawing inspiration from comedic actors playing against type such

as Dave Chappelle in Bradley Cooper’s ‘A Star Is Born’ and the late Don Rickles in ‘Casino.’ Jonathan

believes “Cheech will stand out, bringing charisma and wit to an important role”.

“Fate” also includes Sienna Soho Baker who rejoins her father for the first time since she was 4 years old,

playing opposite Nicholas Cage in “Inconceivable.” James Van Patten rounds out the cast with over 40

movies under his belt including the “Saw” franchise and “Inconceivable”, where he previously worked with

Jonathan. The son of the late Dick Van Patten, James comes from Hollywood royalty and is excited to join

the cast.

Jonathan Baker is producing “Fate The Movie” after being in development for five years, bringing a

singular ambition and passion to creating this feature film.
