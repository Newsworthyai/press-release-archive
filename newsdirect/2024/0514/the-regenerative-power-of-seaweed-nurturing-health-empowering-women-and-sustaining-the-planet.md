Seaweed is a staple food in many Asian cultures, but it is only now gaining significant popularity in the West as well, largely due to its numerous health benefits. Seaweed contains an array of vitamins and minerals such as vitamin K, B vitamins, zinc, and iron. Scientists have cited weight control, anticancer, and antioxidant effects and prebiotic intake as some of the benefits of regularly including seaweed in your diet. Simply put, seaweed might be an underutilized superfood, with reports estimating that the market could be worth $11.8 billion by 2030.

In addition to the health benefits, many scientists and environmentalists are looking to seaweed as a solution to food insecurity and climate change concerns. Seaweed is known for absorbing nitrogen from the water and bolstering biodiversity by providing food and habitat for marine life, among other benefits.

Current estimates reveal that food production is responsible for 80% of all land degradation, 70% of global freshwater use, and a staggering one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions. In stark contrast, seaweed cultivation requires neither land nor freshwater, effectively avoiding these environmental costs altogether. Further, the minimal greenhouse gas emissions associated with seaweed farming make it a highly sustainable alternative to land-based food production.

How Rootless Is Using Seaweed To Benefit Women’s HealthRootless is a company dedicated to revolutionizing the global food system, with a particular focus on women's health. Founded by Sachi Singh, a passionate advocate of seaweed, this company is on a mission to make the health benefits of seaweed accessible to all. The company sources its seaweed from the Atlantic Ocean off the coasts of Maine and Ireland, and says it ensures it meets rigorous quality standards. The seaweed is sustainably harvested, providing livelihoods to coastal communities while simultaneously helping to heal the surrounding ocean environment by absorbing carbon and nitrogen.

Rootless's flagship product, The Daily Bites, a whole-food snackable supplement, can support hormone balance in menopause and beyond with over 40 macro and micronutrients, including vitamins, minerals, and unique bioactives. In a consumer trial where women ate one of the company’s Daily Bites every day for four weeks, 86% experienced higher energy and/or improved metabolism and 83% experienced less bloating and/or constipation, while 97% experienced less hormonal acne and/or dryness.

Rootless is currently hosting a raise to assist with increasing the company’s presence and support more women worldwide, while contributing to the fight against climate change. In an era of dwindling global resources, it is crucial to seize opportunities presented by readily replenishable and ecosystem-enhancing resources like seaweed. Rootless seems well-positioned to introduce seaweed to women searching for solutions to various issues like hormonal acne and hormonal disorders, as well as broadly supporting overall women’s health.
