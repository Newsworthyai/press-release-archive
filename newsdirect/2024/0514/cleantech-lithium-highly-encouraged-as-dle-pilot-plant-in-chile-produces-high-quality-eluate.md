# CleanTech Lithium 'highly encouraged' as DLE pilot plant in Chile produces high-quality eluate

--News Direct--

CleanTech Lithium PLC (AIM:CTL, OTCQX:CTLHF) executive chairman Dt Steve Kesler discusses results from the company's Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) pilot plant in Chile, emphasising its effectiveness in purifying and concentrating lithium from brine, which contains other elements like calcium and magnesium.

Kesler explained that the process increases lithium concentration from around 200 parts per million to over 2,000 parts per million through reverse osmosis. This purified lithium chloride solution is then processed further to produce battery-grade lithium carbonate, demonstrating capabilities beyond initial design expectations.

Kesler also mentioned partnerships with third-party processors in Chicago to advance production capabilities and stressed the sustainability of the extraction method, which uses renewable energy and minimal water. This approach positions CleanTech Lithium favourably to attract potential partners and off-takers, focusing on sustainable and high-quality lithium production for the battery industry.
