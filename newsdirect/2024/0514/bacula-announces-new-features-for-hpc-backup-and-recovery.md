# Bacula Announces New Features for HPC Backup and Recovery

--News Direct--

Expanding its leadership in high security backup and recovery for HPC and demanding IT environments, Bacula Systems today announced new features designed specifi­cally for HPC customers. Bacula is also proud to announce partnerships with many of the in­dustry’s leading performance storage providers.

"Bacula is the only solution capable of handling billions of files in extremely high-throughput applications. Bacula’s participation in the ISC Hamburg exhibition demonstrates its full commitment to helping HPC customers save time and considerable costs" said Gopal RajGuru, Bacula CEO.

Enhancing Bacula’s exceptionally broad storage and Cloud compatibility, a new lock function has been added to align the immutable status of backup data with the backup retention configured in Bacula. Bacula’s Cloud Storage Class is now also configurable in Azure, Oracle and Google. This allows precise control over where to store each backup set, using any kind of criteria, directly from Bacula without touching the destination Cloud storage configuration.

Bacula helps HPC customers automate complex tasks with a new Large Backup File Split feature, which speeds the back up of large numbers of files by splitting the work­load into concurrent backup processes in a simple, smart and automatic way. This saves HPC customers significant amounts of time for very large datasets, and Bacula automatically manages the backup to any file-server or NAS.

“Bacula also reduces the possibility of human error by eliminating the need for a configura­tion update process. This is particularly useful when many users create complex folder struc­tures with lots of different files where the distribution of the data varies dynamically in an unpredictable way” said Jorge Gea, CTO of Bacula Systems.

Partnerships:

Bacula is also delighted to announce a number of new strategic partnerships with the most high-performance and secure storage specialists to build on its growing momentum in the HPC industry, including:

ExaGrid: ExaGrid provides Tiered Backup Storage with a unique disk-cache Landing Zone, long-term retention repository and scale-out architecture. ExaGrid’s Landing Zone provides for the fastest backups, restores, and instant VM recoveries. The Repository Tier offers the lowest cost for long-term retention. ExaGrid’s scale-out architecture includes full appliances and ensures a fixed-length backup window as data grows, eliminating expensive forklift up­grades and product obsolescence. ExaGrid offers comprehensive security and is the only two-tiered backup storage ap­proach with a non-network-facing tier, delayed deletes, and immutable objects to recover from ransomware attacks. Combined with the power of Bacula Enterprise, ExaGrid Tiered Backup Storage provides a backup solution for HPC organizations with the highest performance, security, and scalability at the best price.

Storj: Bacula has launched a strategic partnership with Storj, which delivers faster cloud object storage at 90% less cost than AWS S3 while dramatically reducing data’s carbon footprint. Storj achieves this by leveraging unused global storage space to create a highly-secure global network, eliminating the need for costly data centers and providing enterprise-level durability and high performance without data replication. With Bacula and Storj, businesses save up to 90% on cloud storage with increased security and lower costs. Storj Chief Revenue Officer Colby Wineger said, “Storj is very pleased to partner with Bacula to lower customers’ costs and upgrade enterprise data backup and recovery. Together we help to protect organizations from the problems of downtime and data breaches with a cost-effective approach and lighting-fast downloads.”

SoftIron: SoftIron is a world-leader in true private cloud. Its superior, purpose-built hardware is designed, developed and manufactured in house, and it is the only manufacturer to offer auditable provenance. HyperCloud by SoftIron allows organizations to build a true private cloud on-premises that deploys, manages and consumes like public cloud.
