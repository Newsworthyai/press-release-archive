--News Direct--

AmeriLife Marketing Group (AMG), a national field marketing organization (FMO) for many of the industry’s top insurance carriers and an affiliate of AmeriLife Group, LLC (“AmeriLife”), announced today that it has entered into a partnership with RB Insurance Group, a national marketing organization with over 30 years of experience in the Medicare market concentrating on Special Needs and dual-eligible plan sales. Per the agreement, the terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The AMG partnership aims to streamline solutions and organizational resources for RB Insurance’s network of 450-plus affiliated brokers licensed in 36 states. AmeriLife acquired RB Insurance Group (RBI) from AMBA, a market leader and trusted provider of affinity marketing solutions and supplemental insurance and benefits. Under AMBA, RB Insurance has grown into one of the nation's most diverse IMO insurance and financial services companies.

“We are proud to partner with an esteemed insurance company serving the Medicare market,” said AMG President Nick Hildenbrand. “The partnership between AMG and RBI brings significant meaning to our company as we join forces to empower and protect the health and well-being of countless individuals served by the comprehensive Medicare network. Together, we will navigate the complexities of the healthcare landscape, ensuring that our valued customers receive the highest quality of care and support.”

“RB Insurance knows and understands the value of professional quality and enters our network with an unwavering commitment to provide experienced support staff, proprietary technology, training, education, and stalworth guidance to its agents while serving Medicare’s senior population,” added AMG Principal Doug Stovall. “Our partnership structure will exponentially increase each of these areas while providing additional layers of professional access to industry services that drive results and promote a servant-leadership culture.”

AMBA’s Chief Executive Officer Nick Taylor agrees that RB Insurance will prosper under AmeriLife’s ownership.

“AmeriLife is one of AMBA’s trusted partners for Medicare products, so we are confident that this transaction makes sense for RB Insurance, AmeriLife, and AMBA. AmeriLife will be able to take RB Insurance to new heights while AMBA focuses on its core competencies and growth initiatives.”

RB Insurance has earned a trusted and highly regarded reputation for developing unique contracting packages that align with brokers’ professional aspirations and fuel the drive for sales success.

“This partnership is a testament to our unwavering commitment to excellence, and I am truly honored to lead a team that consistently strives to make a positive impact in the lives of those we serve,” said RB Insurance Group Executive Marketing Director James Gramp. “With this alliance, we now embark on a transformative path where innovation and compassion converge to redefine the future of healthcare.”

AmeriLife’s distribution platform offers partners efficiency, cost value, and access to professional marketing services and culture to drive economies of scale, significantly increasing productivity and bottom-line revenue.

“I am excited to welcome RB Insurance to AMG and our growing distribution network,” said Scotty Elliott, Chief Distribution Officer of Health for AmeriLife. “AMG has experienced significant growth in scale and leadership, representing the perfect partnership model to take RB Insurance to new profitability, industry impact, and human resource expansion levels.”

RB Insurance will continue to operate as a stand-alone business out of its Tempe, Arizona, offices under the leadership of AMG President and Principal Nick Hildenbrand and Doug Stovall, respectively.
