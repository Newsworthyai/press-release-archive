Millions of loving pet owners cannot afford or do not have access to veterinary services and pet resources. Over 20 million pets live in poverty with their families in the US and 70% of pets living in poverty have never seen a veterinarian.

This is a serious issue that is being addressed by the Humane Society of the United States through its More than a Pet campaign.

A nationwide media tour was conducted featuring Kitty Block, President and CEO, The Humane Society of the United States, discussing the aim of the campaign which is to help pets living in poverty with their families and keep people and their pets together, no matter what challenges they face.

The Humane Society of the United States’ More Than a Pet campaign addresses this nationwide crisis head on by elevating awareness and providing solutions for those facing economic hardship and struggling to access care for their pets. With the help of campaign partners TQL, Motel 6, Smalls and Tractive, along with the campaign’s celebrity ambassador Jackson Galaxy—renowned cat behavior and wellness expert, author and television host—More Than a Pet focuses on advancing equity and access to care to keep families and their pets together, happy and healthy.

Kitty Block, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, said, “The human-animal bond transcends demographics, and everyone should have the opportunity to experience the joy of animal companionship. Millions of loving pet owners cannot afford or don’t have access to veterinary services or pet resources. Most people are aware of how poverty and structural inequality create challenges and barriers to accessing healthy food, education, jobs, healthcare and housing for people. Pet resources are no different.”

Galaxy added, “There is no greater joy than the unconditional love and relationship we have with our animal family members. They are more than just pets; they’re part of our lives and our hearts, and no one should ever have to even think about giving them up because they don’t have access to pet food, supplies and essential resources. We need to do all we can to keep these families together. People can make a difference by helping a neighbor out, whether that be giving them a bag of cat food, offering to care for their cat if they have fallen on hard times, or driving them to veterinary appointments if they don’t have a car. Every bit helps and means more than you know.”

An important component of the campaign is the More Than a Pet Community Hero Award, recognizing the contributions of three community heroes who are making a difference by working to ensure the well-being of people and their pets in communities lacking access to resources like pet food and veterinary care. The public is encouraged to show their support by voting for the hero whose story impacts them most.

People can also make a big difference by simply spreading the word about this enormous crisis and by helping their neighbors. Every act of kindness goes a long way:

* Offer to pet sit
* Drive them to a veterinary appointment
* Collect pet essential donations for them
* Buy an extra bag of cat or dog food
* Foster someone’s pet if they fall on hard times

Since 2002, the Humane Society of the United States has served more than 500,000 pets and their families living in poverty with veterinary services such as spay/neuter and vaccinations at no cost to the pet’s family. The HSUS has also donated more than $40 million worth of pet supplies, including 14 million pounds of pet food.

About More Than a Pet

Launched in 2023, the Humane Society of the United States’ More Than a Pet campaign honors the love people have for their pets, celebrates and protects the human-animal bond and aims to show that this bond transcends race, ethnicity, geography and socioeconomic status. Through programs like Pets for Life and Rural Area Veterinary Services, the HSUS supports hundreds of thousands of people and pets who do not have access to veterinary care and pet essentials. A key part of this work is to bring equity in access to pet care for underserved communities and increase diversity in the animal welfare movement, efforts which are long overdue and necessary to recognize the human in humane. Together with our corporate partners, More Than a Pet raises awareness and funds for these critical programs and the HSUS’ work to fight for all animals.
