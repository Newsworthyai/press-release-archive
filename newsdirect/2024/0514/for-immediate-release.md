# FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

--News Direct--

Apple Rush Company, Inc. (Otcpink:APRU), a leading player in the functional beverage industry, proudly announces it has cleared up final details of brand ownership with Bob Corr and Corr Brands, Inc. Tony Torgerud, CEO of Apple Rush, has negotiated a historical closing on the rights and trademarks of Corr Brands, Inc. In the transaction, Bob Corr has agreed to transfer the rights of the Corr Brands, Inc. trademarks and to forgo any royalties from previous agreements to give Tony and Apple Rush the best opportunity to succeed moving forward.Tony Torgerud said, “I have been negotiating for a year with Bob and he finally felt it was time to work out an agreement that would benefit everyone. Over the next couple months, all the required paperwork will be filed for transference and updates on all intellectual property held by Corr Brands, Inc. Not having to pay royalties will add thousands to the bottom line.” This agreement solidifies the future of the “Rush” family of brands that have been in the market since 1972. Bob Corr stated, “I want to see Apple Rush succeed and I feel the timing is right to get this deal done. I retired a long time ago and it is now time to write the next chapters of this story and with Apple Rush having its own production capabilities and its own tunnel pasteurizer, it is an opportunity that shouldn’t be wasted. I have given up hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties, licensing fees and shares to enhance shareholder value.” With our pilot production abilities, we hope to do some reformulations to introduce a 2024 version of Ginseng Rush and the relaunch of the original Apple Rush flavor line. Apple Rush has held a license for 13 states and International distribution for the last 8 years and now owns the IP without paying the $5,000 per state license, another bottom line gain for all of our stockholders.
