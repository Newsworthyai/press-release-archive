Cancer doesn’t discriminate by age today. Consider celebrities like Chadwick Boseman, who died from colon cancer; Olivia Munn, who recently underwent a double mastectomy; Ninja, a popular streamer on Twitch diagnosed with skin cancer; and Catherine, the Princess of Wales, who is currently being treated for the disease. All of them were diagnosed before the age of 50.

Why is this happening and what can we do to catch it early?

There are several reasons: diet, lifestyle, and environmental factors. The College of American Pathologists is emphasizing the importance of early detection, screening, and being vigilant regarding symptoms.

A nationwide media tour was conducted to discuss this important issue featuring Dr. Donald Karcher, president of the College of American Pathologists.

Topics that Dr. Karcher discussed included:

· What is behind the soaring trend of younger adults being diagnosed with cancer?

· What symptoms to look for to improve cancer outcomes.

· What cancers can and should be screened for?

· What if you don’t meet the minimum age requirements for screening but are having symptoms?

· Discussing the importance of early detection.
