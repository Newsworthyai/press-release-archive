# Flash Transforms Parking at Denver International Airport

Flash, the leading end-to-end parking technology platform, announced today it has completed an overhaul of public and employee parking at Denver International Airport (DEN) through a contract the City and County of Denver awarded in August 2024. In just 22 days, Flash deployed its platform across the airport’s nine public and employee parking garages and lots, bringing a state-of-the-art parking experience to DEN’s 40,000 employees and the 77.8 million passengers they serve annually.

"Flash’s commitment to DEN has been tremendous and we look forward to a bright future that provides innovative solutions to improve the customer experience," said Mark Nagel, Senior Vice President of Parking and Commercial Transportation, Denver International Airport.

In its first few weeks of deployment, DEN reports improved traffic flow and reduced wait times for vehicles entering and exiting the airport’s parking facilities. DEN’s deployment of Flash’s platform spans 144 lanes and features 137 kiosks, 97 license plate recognition (LPR) lanes, and 49 automatic vehicle identification (AVI) lanes. With the new AVI lanes, employees can enter and exit automatically in seconds via vehicle-mounted passes that require no interaction with their phones or kiosks.

“DEN is the sixth busiest airport in the world and sees millions of parking transactions each year, requiring the highest service level,” said Flash CEO Dan Sharplin. “Our technology breadth and industry-leading scale, plus our maniacal focus on the driver experience, made us confident we could support DEN’s traffic volumes and service levels while getting passengers and employees through parking transactions quickly, and it’s hugely gratifying to see it live.”

DEN also benefits from the Flash platform’s design as an enhanced cloud-based parking solution. In the event of an internet, payment processor, network or cloud disruption, the platform maintains continuous operations and critical payment processing capabilities so the airport’s parking facilities stay up and running.
