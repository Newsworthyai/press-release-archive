In a landmark partnership, TEAM 1144, led by project management international speaker, educator, and consultant Nesty Delgado, and the University of Puerto Rico-Mayagüez (UPR-Mayagüez) have joined forces to launch the Project Management & Transformational Leadership Institute (PMTL Institute). This collaboration represents a significant advancement in Puerto Rico’s educational landscape, specifically in project management and transformational leadership, two fields critical to the island’s future.

UPR-Mayagüez, celebrated for its outstanding School of Engineering, is the ideal partner for this initiative. The university’s reputation as the top academic institution in Puerto Rico and its commitment to excellence made it the perfect collaborator for TEAM 1144’s vision. Nesty Delgado, a proud alumnus of UPR-Mayagüez and founder of TEAM 1144, personally signed the agreement with the university’s Rector, Dr. Agustín Rullán Toro, and Dr. Roberto Seijo, Dean of the College of Business Administration. This moment marked not just a professional achievement, but a deeply personal one for Nesty Delgado, who has long held his alma mater in high regard.

“The PMTL Institute aims to provide top-tier education and professional development opportunities in project management, transformational leadership, and change management. The institute’s programs are meticulously designed to equip professionals with the skills and knowledge necessary to lead complex projects, particularly those related to Puerto Rico’s ongoing reconstruction and resilience efforts. The initiative is not just about education; it’s about empowering a new generation of leaders who will drive Puerto Rico’s future forward.” Said Alba Norys De Leon, president of AblaTek, an important strategic ally in this endeavor.

The Importance for Puerto RicoPuerto Rico is at a critical juncture in its history. With billions of dollars in public and private investment flowing into the island for infrastructure projects, there is a pressing need for skilled professionals who can lead these initiatives effectively. The PMTL Institute is positioned to play a pivotal role in addressing this need. Under Nesty Delgado’s guidance and TEAM 1144 experiences in several projects around the Island, the institute will offer a comprehensive curriculum that blends leadership skills and theoretical knowledge with practical application, ensuring that graduates are fully prepared to take on leadership roles in the island’s transformation.

The signing of the agreement also received significant support from government leadership, with the Secretary of the Department of Economic Development and Commerce, Mr. Manuel Cidre, playing a key role in endorsing the initiative. His participation underscores the importance of this collaboration for Puerto Rico's economic future, aligning with the government’s broader efforts to drive the island’s recovery and growth through strategic investments in education and professional development. The support from such high levels of government reflects the far-reaching impact this initiative is expected to have.

TEAM 1144 and UPR-Mayagüez: A Partnership for ProgressThis collaboration between TEAM 1144 and UPR-Mayagüez is a testament to what can be achieved when the private sector and academia come together with a shared vision. The institute’s programs are tailored to the unique challenges and opportunities facing Puerto Rico, ensuring that the skills developed are directly applicable to the local context. The inclusion of advanced topics such as change management and transformational leadership reflects the institute’s commitment to providing a holistic education that prepares professionals to not only manage projects but to lead transformational change within their organizations and communities.

Dr. Roberto Seijo, the Dean of the College of Business Administration at UPR-Mayagüez, has been instrumental in bringing this vision to life. His leadership within EDUCON, the university’s continuous education unit, has ensured that the PMTL Institute’s offerings are aligned with the highest academic standards while remaining accessible to professionals across the island. This combined effort has created a powerful platform for professional growth and development in Puerto Rico.
