# Transforming Oncology: Stocks to Watch in the Oncology Sector

In oncology, the drive for innovation is forging new paths in cancer treatment. The field is rapidly evolving with advances in targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and novel technologies, each promising to reshape patient outcomes. Let’s explore some standout companies that are leading the charge in this transformative era of cancer care with their cutting-edge approaches and pioneering therapies.

OS Therapies Inc. (NYSEAmerican: OSTX) is gaining attention in the biotech space for its cutting-edge approaches to treating osteosarcoma and other solid tumors through immunotherapy and antibody drug conjugate (ADC) platforms. The company’s focus on developing next-generation therapeutics and its recent positive data make it a compelling candidate for investors seeking exposure to innovative cancer treatments.

Advancing Immunotherapy with OST-HER2

The company's lead asset, OST-HER2, is a novel immunotherapy designed to treat resected, recurrent osteosarcoma. This treatment utilizes Listeria bacteria to stimulate the immune system to target the HER2 protein. OSTX has recently completed enrollment for its Phase 2b clinical trial involving 41 patients, with results expected in the fourth quarter of 2024. OST-HER2 aims to prevent metastasis, delay recurrence, and increase overall survival, representing a potential breakthrough for a disease that has not seen significant advancements in decades. If successful, this treatment could address the unmet need for effective adjuvant therapies in osteosarcoma, offering hope to patients with recurrent disease.

Innovative Antibody Drug Conjugate Platform

OSTX is also making strides with its tunable ADC (tADC) platform, leveraging its proprietary SiLinker technology. The platform incorporates pH-sensitive silicon-based linkers capable of releasing multiple therapeutic agents selectively within the tumor microenvironment. Recent preclinical data on their ovarian cancer therapeutic candidate, OST-tADC-FRA-H, showcased strong antitumor activity in mouse models and a favorable safety profile with no significant loss of body weight among treated animals. This preclinical success demonstrates the potential of OS Therapies' technology to enhance the efficacy and safety of ADCs, paving the way for multiple new therapeutic candidates.

The company's SiLinker technology is not just about delivering payloads; it also holds the promise of improving existing ADC combinations or creating entirely new intellectual properties. This flexibility could position OS Therapies as a key player in the growing ADC market, which is projected to reach $20.9 billion by 2030, according to Grandview Research.

Strategic Collaborations and Industry Recognition

OS Therapies' potential is further underscored by its acceptance into Johnson & Johnson Innovation (JLABS), which provides access to resources that could accelerate the development of its tADC platform. This membership could facilitate critical partnerships and collaborations, enhancing the company’s ability to bring its innovative therapies to market.

Additionally, OSTX has formed both a Patient Advocacy Advisory Board (PAAB) and a Scientific and Medical Advisory Board (SMAB), drawing expertise from leading institutions such as Texas Children’s Hospital, the Cleveland Clinic, and the University of California, San Francisco. These boards will guide the company as it engages with the FDA and prepares for a potential Biologics License Authorization (BLA) for OST-HER2. This strategic alignment with top medical professionals and patient advocates strengthens OS Therapies’ position in navigating the regulatory landscape and underscores its commitment to addressing patient needs.

With its innovative pipeline, strategic collaborations, and strong leadership, OSTX is well-positioned to capitalize on the expanding oncology market. The ongoing development of OST-HER2 and the tADC platform could lead to significant milestones, including potential FDA approvals that would not only validate its scientific approach but also create substantial market opportunities. As a clinical-stage company with promising technologies and strategic industry support, OS Therapies represents a compelling opportunity in the biopharmaceutical sector.

Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSEAmerican: ATNM) is developing targeted radiotherapies to improve treatment outcomes for patients with blood cancers and other serious conditions. Their lead candidate, Iomab-B, is in late-stage development as a conditioning agent for bone marrow transplants, with potential U.S. and European regulatory submissions on the horizon. Actimab-A, another promising candidate, is targeting relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is developed in partnership with the National Cancer Institute.

The company recently advanced Iomab-ACT, designed for conditioning before bone marrow transplants in sickle cell disease patients, with the potential to offer a safer, non-chemotherapy alternative. This targeted approach aims to minimize the toxicities typically seen with traditional conditioning methods, positioning Iomab-ACT as a unique option in a growing market driven by expanding cell and gene therapy applications.

Actinium’s strategy is bolstered by a strong intellectual property portfolio with over 230 patents, including new protections for Iomab-ACT in gene therapy conditioning for non-malignant conditions. However, the company faces a regulatory hurdle as the FDA has requested an additional clinical trial for Iomab-B after a mixed outcome in its Phase 3 trial. Actinium is now seeking a partner to help advance Iomab-B while focusing on its broader pipeline.

With a unique technology platform and a growing addressable market in cell and gene therapies, Actinium Pharmaceuticals holds potential as an emerging player in the targeted radiotherapy space.

Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRBP) is positioning itself as a key player in precision oncology, with promising advancements in its clinical pipeline. The company's leading asset, CRB-701, a next-generation antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), targets Nectin-4, a well-validated cancer marker. Recent clinical data from the ASCO 2024 conference show encouraging results in both metastatic urothelial cancer and cervical cancer. CRB-701 delivered an overall response rate (ORR) of 44% in mUC and 43% in cervical cancer, with strong disease control rates (DCR) of 78% and 86%, respectively. Importantly, no major toxicities have been observed at higher doses, positioning CRB-701 as a potentially safer option in its class.

Corbus expects to complete the Phase 1 dose escalation study for CRB-701 by Q4 2024, with data presentation planned for early 2025. This upcoming milestone could serve as a major catalyst for the stock, particularly if the safety and efficacy data continue to align with the results seen so far.

Additionally, Corbus is advancing its other assets, including CRB-601, which targets the tumor microenvironment, and CRB-913, a treatment for obesity. Both programs are expected to enter clinical trials by early 2025, broadening the company’s pipeline and increasing its potential value.

Financially, Corbus is in a strong position, with $147 million in cash and investments as of June 30, 2024. This provides the company with a cash runway through Q3 2027, allowing it to advance its key programs without the immediate need for additional capital raises. Recent fundraising efforts, including $35.6 million raised through its ATM program, further strengthen the company's financial foundation.

For investors, Corbus represents a high-potential opportunity, particularly with multiple clinical milestones on the horizon. The company’s focus on innovative, targeted therapies in oncology, combined with its solid financial standing, makes it a stock to watch in the biotech sector.

Puma Biotechnology, Inc. (NASDAQ: PBYI) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing treatments to enhance cancer care. Puma licensed the global rights to PB272 in 2011, and in 2017, the U.S. FDA approved neratinib for extended adjuvant treatment of early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer following trastuzumab-based therapy. Marketed under the name NERLYNX in the U.S., the drug received further FDA approval in 2020 for combination use with capecitabine to treat advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer after two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens. NERLYNX also gained marketing authorization in the EU in 2018 for the extended adjuvant treatment of hormone receptor-positive, HER2-overexpressed breast cancer patients within a year of completing trastuzumab therapy.

In September 2022, Puma entered into an exclusive license agreement for alisertib, a selective, small-molecule, orally administered inhibitor of aurora kinase A, initially targeting small-cell lung cancer and breast cancer. In February 2024, Puma initiated ALISCA-Lung1, a Phase II trial of alisertib monotherapy for extensive stage small cell lung cancer. In June 2024, data on alisertib's use in advanced osimertinib-resistant EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer was presented at the ASCO Annual Meeting. The Phase I/Ib study evaluated 21 patients who progressed on osimertinib monotherapy, with alisertib doses of 30 mg and 40 mg twice daily in combination with osimertinib 80 mg daily. The 30 mg dose was identified as the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase II dose.

The study reported an overall response rate of 9.5% and a disease control rate of 81%. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.5 months, with median overall survival (OS) of 23.5 months. Subgroup analysis showed differences in outcomes based on TP53 mutation status, with patients who were TP53 wild-type experiencing a higher overall response rate and longer PFS compared to those with TP53 mutations. Based on these findings, Puma is modifying the trial protocol to focus on the TP53 wild-type cohort.

For the second quarter of 2024, Puma reported revenue of $47.1 million, down 14% from the previous year but still exceeding analyst estimates by 5.4%. Earnings per share also beat estimates by 9.1%. Despite these beats, the company posted a net loss of $4.53 million, a significant drop from a $2.13 million profit in the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, Puma’s revenue is projected to decline by 2% annually over the next three years, contrasting with the 18% growth expected in the U.S. biotech sector.

Additionally, on August 5, 2024, Puma granted a restricted stock unit award covering 3,500 shares to a new non-executive employee under its 2017 Employment Inducement Incentive Award Plan. The award vests over three years and serves as an inducement for employment in line with Nasdaq rules.
