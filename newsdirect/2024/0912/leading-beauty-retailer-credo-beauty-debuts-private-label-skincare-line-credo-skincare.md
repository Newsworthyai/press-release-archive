# Leading Beauty Retailer Credo Beauty Debuts Private Label Skincare Line: Credo Skincare

Credo, the specialty clean beauty retail pioneer, is proud to announce the launch of its own eponymous skincare line, Credo Skincare. The specialty retailer has raised the bar introducing a benefit-driven collection of skincare products focused on the #1 skin concern gathered from clients – hydration – while continuing to challenge and elevate standards for clean and sustainable products and packaging. A cohesive easy to navigate cleanser and moisturizer system meets wanted gold standards.

A decade ago, Credo disrupted an underregulated industry as a catalyst for positive change spurring a tidal wave of conscientious product and packaging innovation. Now after accruing 10 years of customer feedback, experience, and data Credo Skincare was developed according to what they found matters most. Ultimately hydration was the stand-out concern for clients. And through in-depth analysis, Credo determined the top ingredient and search terms according to what customers want from their products to deliver that and more. Through their access to the best in business partners, they created results-driven formulas packed with clinically proven actives and sustainably- minded packaging - every aspect of Credo Skincare is transparent and powerfully effective.

Credo Skincare’s first collection is comprised of two cleansers ($44 each) and four moisturizers ($64 each) that service skin conditions surrounding primary concerns - dry skin, sensitivity and redness, dullness, and aging - by nourishing the skin and protecting its microbiome through today’s most powerful active combinations. Their formulations are based on key ingredient search terms and skincare concerns. As well, each product contains the transformative power of upcycled vetiver root extract, ethically harvested by a local cooperative in Haiti. Vetiver root is an antioxidant-loaded, potent wonder grass that supports the protection of the skin’s barrier for a vibrant skin tone and a nourished complexion while improving skin texture and reducing the appearance of pores and wrinkles. Credo Skincare’s goals are to provide an easy two step, effective regimen for healthy, hydrated skin that makes customers look and feel their best. Clinicals have proven 27% improvement in hydration after 24 hours, 31% improvement in hydration instantly, and an improvement in the skin barrier function instantly and after 24 hours.

● Deep Thirst Hydrating Cleanser ($44): A transformative formula to deeply cleanse while retaining moisture.

● True Timeout Calming Cleanser ($44): Designed to soothe and calm sensitive skin.

● Deep Thirst Hydrating Moisturizer ($64): Provides intense hydration with lasting effects.

● True Timeout Calming Moisturizer ($64): Helps alleviate sensitivity and redness.

● Radiance Rising Brightening Moisturizer ($64): Brightens dull skin and enhances radiance.

● Rewinder Anti-Aging Moisturizer ($64): Reduces the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines.

Beyond that as a retailer, Credo Beauty continues to drive the packaging and social standards that are the hallmarks of tomorrow. Every pump and cap in the Credo Skincare collection is comprised of a first-of-its kind PCR resin, including beauty waste packaging collected in Credo Beauty stores nationwide through Pact Collective, the non-profit Credo Beauty co-founded to divert beauty packaging from landfills.

● The Credo pump was created with Pact’s NewMatter material, a mixture of hard-to-recycle material or landfill and ocean-bound plastic.

● The first run of NewMatter pumps eliminated the need for 500 kg of virgin plastic (500 kg of recycled plastic used is equivalent to 11 cubic meters of landfill space or ~2,900 gallons of space!) ​

● Every 38 pumps eliminate one pound of material going to the landfill or ocean.​

“The benefit of listening to 10 years of customers' desires and skin concerns compelled us to create this line. Years of data drove the ingredient compositions of these products so that we could exceed our customers’ expectations for efficacy. Our Credo Clean Standard is already rigorous and difficult to attain but we wanted to challenge ourselves with how our own brand could take clean innovation to new heights from full disclosure of fragrance ingredients and packaging innovation to exceeding the minimum requirements to check certain boxes, Credo Skincare raises the bar on what is possible and what can become the future baseline,” says Co-Founder and CEO Annie Jackson.

Availability: Credo Skincare will be available for purchase starting September 12, 2024, at all Credo brick and mortar store locations and on www.credobeauty.com.
