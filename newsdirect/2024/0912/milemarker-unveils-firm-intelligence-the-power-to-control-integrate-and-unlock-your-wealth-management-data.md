# Milemarker Unveils Firm Intelligence: The Power to Control, Integrate, and Unlock Your Wealth Management Data

Milemarker, a fintech firm dedicated to empowering wealth management companies with deeper insights from their existing tech stacks, today announced the launch of its groundbreaking platform, Firm Intelligence. This innovative solution is set to revolutionize how financial advisors automate processes, integrate systems, and communicate with clients and prospects.

Founded in 2021, Milemarker has swiftly become the go-to platform for financial advisors seeking to extract more value from their disparate technology providers. By synthesizing data across various systems, Milemarker delivers a streamlined, operational, and client-service-level solution that enhances efficiency and drives growth.

“Milemarker is the connective tissue that allows firms to harness data insights to better manage their clients and scale their businesses,” said Milemarker CEO Kyle Van Pelt. “With the launch of Firm Intelligence, we’re enabling wealth management firms to maximize the potential of their current tech stacks, allowing them to focus their time and resources on what truly matters: serving clients and engaging with prospects.”

Milemarker serves advisory firms managing assets ranging from $250 million to over $200 billion. For these firms, mergers and acquisitions are often strategic priorities, yet they present significant challenges when onboarding businesses with different technology systems. Milemarker addresses this integration gap by automating workflows and creating broader data connectivity through one seamless, easy-to-use platform.

“Given the rapid pace of technological advancement, expecting wealth management firms to invest in new tools continuously is neither practical nor cost-effective,” said Milemarker Co-Founder and Managing Partner Jud Mackrill. “With Milemarker, we’re advocating for a smarter approach: invest in your people and processes, and let us help you get the most out of the technology you already have. We empower financial advisors to enhance their use of technology while delivering a clear return on investment.”

Milemarker’s Firm Intelligence consolidates all essential data into a single pane of glass. Financial advisory firms can seamlessly integrate Milemarker into their systems or engage with it through a branded application that can live on their domain and be entirely privately labeled to their brand.

In just two years, Milemarker has built a fast-growing company with team members across the United States and an impressive roster of some of today’s fastest-growing advisory firms.

“Thanks to Milemarker Firm Intelligence, our leadership team and advisors now have greater access to the data we need to effectively run our business,” said SignatureFD Chief Information Officer Laura Hubbell. “We’ve been able to automatically create reports that would have otherwise taken us weeks– including some that would have been nearly impossible to do. We’re in a new era of transparency and automation of data in our business.”

Following the platform’s launch, Milemarker is set to roll out several new features and enhancements in the coming months, further solidifying its position as a leader in fintech innovation for wealth management.
