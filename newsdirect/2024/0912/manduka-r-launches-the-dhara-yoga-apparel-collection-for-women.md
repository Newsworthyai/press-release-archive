# MANDUKA® Launches the Dhara Yoga Apparel Collection for Women

Manduka, creators of high performance yoga gear and the #1 choice of yoga teachers worldwide, revealed today its Dhara collection, a five-piece line of foundational yoga apparel designed for comfort, movement, and sustainability. Honoring a request from the yoga community to provide apparel they can feel good about wearing and how it is made, the Dhara collection was created with the highest standards in performance and sustainability. It’s the newest drop in the company’s plan to set the benchmark for environmentally conscious leadership in the performance wellness industry through 2025.

The Dhara Collection offers a simple and easy to wear combination of premium quality, sustainability, and performance in yoga apparel. It’s designed with 88% recycled materials, a difference you can actually feel when wearing. The collection is also free from many of the harmful chemicals that can be found in other performance wear like pesticides, BPA, PFAS and formaldehyde. Technical, breathable and buttery soft, it addresses the demand for thoughtfully designed activewear that doesn’t compromise on style or functionality.

“Manduka is on a path to elevate the performance and sustainability of its hardgoods and apparel lines over the next several years,” said Pamela Levine, CEO Manduka. “You will see Manduka build on its legacy of creating soulfully engineered products through usage of renewed materials, innovative manufacturing methods, and pre and post consumer waste reduction efforts. We are excited to unveil the Dhara collection as the first in this roadmap to further seamlessly integrate Manduka’s high-performance standards with a deep commitment to sustainability at a level not yet seen in the industry.”

The translation of Dhara means earth with an homage to create a product with attention to the recycled materials that make up this collection. The timeless pieces are designed to offer a second skin feel that enhances your practice and doesn’t distract. The Dhara collection is made up of five ultra-soft pieces including:

* Dhara Bra - sleek, supportive pullover bra with four-way stretch. Features a flattering scoop neckline, low open back, and hidden underbust band.
* Dhara Capri Legging - high waisted fit and sleek styling makes it a versatile cropped legging with long lasting comfort.
* Dhara Tank - sophisticated racer back tank with a modest cropped fit. Designed with a double-knit construction with four-way stretch allows you to flow effortlessly.
* Dhara Legging - high waisted fit and sleek styling makes it a versatile legging with long lasting comfort. Created with a matte finish fabrication and four-way stretch ensure you move effortlessly and feel at one with your body.
