# ASSOCIATION OF PICKLEBALL PLAYERS TO DOUBLE EVENT CALENDAR IN 2025

The APP increases its commitment to growing the sport of pickleball with more opportunities for pro and amateur players, stronger investment in player development initiatives and more national television exposure for APP Tour events

The Association of Pickleball Players (APP) has announced a dramatic expansion of its 2025 tournament calendar featuring nearly 50 world-class competitions throughout the year. Beginning in January 2025, the APP’s seventh year will showcase its most robust calendar ever and celebrates its first year at its state-of-the-art headquarters at The Fort in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

“The APP has enjoyed a strong 2024, positioning us perfectly for even more significant growth in 2025,” commented APP Founder Ken Herrmann. “The experiences the APP provides for pickleball players, across all ages and all abilities, sets the standard in pickleball worldwide. We remain committed to delivering the absolute best experience for all players and paving the way for America’s future pickleball stars. As we continue to grow, we are leading the world in the sport’s development.”

Expanded Opportunities for Pros and Amateurs

The APP Tour is meeting the increased demand for opportunities to play across all ages and skill levels by doubling competitions in 2025, highlighted by:

* 14 nationally televised APP Tour events – with increased prize purses – will include four APP Tour Majors, eight USA Pickleball “Golden Ticket” tournaments, the APP Women’s Open presented by The James and the APP U.S. Collegiate Championships
* More than 20 new APP Tour competitions serving tens of thousands of pickleball players at the pro and amateur level across the United States, including the return of the AARP Champions Cup and the APP Atlantic Cup

More Nationally Televised Events

The APP Tour also is expanding its industry-leading linear broadcast schedule to more than 55 hours in 2025. This includes 14 nationally televised APP Tour events, giving the nation’s top pickleball pros unprecedented visibility on a national stage. Pickleball fans across the country will enjoy unparalleled access to the sport’s most competitive matches, allowing them to experience the excitement firsthand.

“We’re thrilled to provide more fans with access to pickleball’s biggest moments, helping elevate the sport to new heights,” said APP Chief Marketing Officer Tom Webb. “Expanding our linear TV coverage in 2025 is not only a testament to pickleball’s growing national appeal but also crucial in giving our pro players the platform they deserve while driving the sport’s continued growth across the country.”

Player Development Initiatives

The APP's commitment to player development and growing the game among youth pickleball players is unmatched, as demonstrated by an expanded APP Next Gen schedule in 2025. Aspiring pickleball professionals aged 23 and younger will have the opportunity to participate in four APP Next Gen Series events and four APP Next Gen II events, competing for prize money while receiving mentorship from top APP Tour professionals.

This is accompanied by the APP Academy’s January launch at The Fort, the APP’s global headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, FL. This marks the world’s first pickleball academy, offering pickleball training and development rooted in the same spirit as development academies in the racquet sports world. The APP Academy will provide a platform for aspiring APP Next Gen, APP Collegiate and junior pickleball players ages 12-18. Further details will be announced this Fall.

International Events

The global expansion of competitive and recreational pickleball remains a priority for the APP, which is proud of its status as the primary steward of the sport’s rapid international growth. The APP’s 2025 initiatives will support several international events, with the full slate to be announced later.
