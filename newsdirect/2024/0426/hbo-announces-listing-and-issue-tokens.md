New York, USA, April 26, 2024 - HBO Film and Television Media Company announced plans to go public in the third quarter and issue HBO Token

HBO, the industry's leading film and television media company, announced today that it will be listed on the U.S. stock market in the third quarter of 2024 and launch its exclusive token HBO Token. This move is part of HBO's commitment to becoming an innovator in the film and television industry, and also aims to strengthen interaction with users and create win-win opportunities for the company and users.

HBO Film and Television Media Company was established in 2023 and has quickly become a powerful force in the industry with its excellent film and television production and distribution capabilities. At present, the company's digital AI ticket purchasing business segment has won the popularity of users around the world, with the number of daily active users reaching 500,000. At the end of the first quarter of 2024, HBO reached its interim revenue target, laying the foundation for the company to go public in the third quarter. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the listing plan, HBO has submitted relevant financial statements to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and plans to issue HBO Token at the same time as the listing, striving to achieve a breakthrough in the WEB3.0 field.

HBO is planning to use its advantages in the film and television media field to expand diversified growth directions and create a win-win situation for users and the company.

HBO's planning team predicts that HBO Token has the potential to increase value up to 100 times after entering the market. This is due to the company's accumulated experience in the industry and its extensive user base. In addition, based on WEB3.0 technology, HBO Token will provide users with higher privacy protection and more convenient transaction liquidity. The application scenarios of HBO Token are very rich, covering film and television, entertainment, consumption and other fields. Whether it is purchasing movie tickets, shopping, or participating in film and television project investments and community activities, HBO Token will become an important means of payment. This not only provides holders with a diverse usage experience, but also increases the appreciation potential of the token.
