Established altcoins such as Solana (SOL) and Toncoin (TON) experience market swings. However, none have risen as rapidly as KangaMoon (KANG), a rising Stage 5 presale star. Early buyers of this altcoin have already obtained a 290% ROI. Many analysts hint that this crypto may become the next $1 altcoin in 2024. Let’s see why.

Altcoin Sherpa Remains Bullish for the Solana CoinRecently, Solana (SOL) has been on an uptrend. According to CoinMarketCap data, the Solana price increased from $136 to $153 over the past week alone. Its market cap soared from $60.73B to $68.66B during that time. Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa claims that a price chop between the $115-$140 area could signal a bottom for SOL, which is very bullish.

The technical analysis for the Solana crypto also shows bullish signs. For example, this altcoin trades above its 100 and 200-day EMAs while boasting 25 green technical indicators. As a result, experts in the crypto field have made a bullish Solana price prediction. They forecast a jump to $228.09 before Q2 of 2024 ends for Solana.

Toncoin Price Analysis: Showing an Upward Trajectory Meanwhile, Toncoin (TON) is another altcoin that has been soaring. CoinMarketCap data shows that the Toncoin price jumped from $4.90 to $5.65 in the last 30 days. This altcoin’s market cap surged from $17.09B to $19.64B in that period.

This bullish trend for the Toncoin crypto may continue as its technical analysis is bullish. Notably, there are now 15 technical indicators in the buy zone. Not only that, Toncoin is now trading above its 50—and 100-day EMAs. Market analysts note all these factors when making their Toncoin price predictions. Thus, they predict a rise to $3.34 within Q2 of 2024.

KangaMoon (KANG): A Future Member of the Top 10 AltcoinsDuring the market shifts of Solana and Toncoin, KangaMoon (KANG) emerged as a contender with great potential. This altcoin is gaining popularity, boasting over 20K community members and 5.8K KANG holders. Traders have been captivated by the project’s attention to the Play-to-Earn (P2E) industry, which is estimated to be worth $885M by 2028.

KANG is unique in its use as an in-game currency for KangaMoon’s upcoming P2E game. This adds value because players can buy items in-game or even upgrade their characters. Additionally, KangaMoon will give KANG holders exclusive access to weekly, monthly, and quarterly challenges for extra tokens and in-game items.

Moreover, its focus on giving back sets KangaMoon apart from others. So far, free KANG tokens have been distributed among the most active community members before launching officially. Consequently, this move has made countless individuals engage with KangaMoon’s social media posts by liking, sharing and retweeting them.

KANG costs just $0.0196 as it is in Stage 5 of its presale—a 290% jump from its starting price. However, analysts still strongly believe in Kangamoon’s future growth potential. They foresee a rise to $1 once a Tier-1 CEX lists this altcoin in Q2 of 2024. With this prediction coming true, KANG may emerge as one of the best altcoins to buy.

Can KangaMoon Outpace Solana and Toncoin? With a market cap of $19.6M, KangaMoon may outpace Solana and Toncoin since it needs fewer new funds to raise its price. Thanks to this advantage, KangaMoon has the potential to become one of the top 10 altcoins that you can now buy for a low price.
