AI Misfire Leads to Viral PR Recovery

We highlight one of the year's most bizarre PR events in which a major tech company attempted to automate an entire PR campaign using AI, but the results were more comical than cutting-edge. The incident serves as a reminder of the potential pitfalls of AI in PR and the importance of adaptability during a crisis.

Navigating the Political Center: A PR Strategy for Moderates

With election season approaching and political divisions more visible than ever, PRevolution explores how a centrist independent presidential candidate might successfully run a campaign. In a hypothetical scenario, we make suggestions about the strategies such a candidate would need to employ to connect with the presumably enormous political middle in the U.S.

PR in Baseball and Politics Intersect in November

In somewhat of an historical anomaly, we examine the convergence of two major events—Game 4 of the World Series and Election Day, which occur just days apart this year. Taking inspiration from both the political and sports arenas, we identified the PR firms excelling in each.

Top PR Performers of 2024’s First Half

We recognize the PR firms that delivered outstanding financial performance in the first half of 2024. We found a mixed bag of small, medium and large agencies that enjoyed a hot first half.

CEO’s Monthly Thoughts on Key PR Topics

Continuing with the Post-Season baseball theme, News Direct CEO and founder Gregg Castano’s October editorial addresses the PR impact of Major League Baseball's increasing shift to paid streaming services for game broadcasts. While streaming offers convenience and attracts younger, tech-savvy viewers, Castano warns that this strategy risks alienating MLB's core fanbase.

These articles and more are featured in the October 2024 edition of "PRevolution," keeping you informed on the latest trends, strategies, and lessons from the PR world.
