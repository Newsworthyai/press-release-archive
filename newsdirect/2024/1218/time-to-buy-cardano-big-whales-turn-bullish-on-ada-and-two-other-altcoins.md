Cardano (ADA) and Sui (SUI) have both experienced impressive rallies over the past month and have quickly become some of the hottest Layer 1 platforms in the space. Cutoshi (CUTO) also continues to tear through milestones as its viral presale has attracted thousands of investors rushing to secure an allocation. Let’s dive deeper into each of these projects and see how they compare in terms of ROI.

Accumulation Continues For Cardano As Crucial Update Is UnveiledCardano (ADA) has entered a cool-off phase after peaking at $1.30 in early December. After a retest of the $0.92 support during the market-wide flash crash, Cardano rebounded and settled around the $1.12 mark. Meanwhile, whales continue to accumulate preposterous amounts of ADA in anticipation of the next leg up. Analyst Ali Martinez has shared some on-chain insights, showing that over the last few days, large wallets have scooped up over $80 million worth of Cardano.

It’s never a bad idea to follow the money, especially when the bull run is just starting to ramp up. Many experts believe that Cardano is on the verge of a breakout and Cantonese Cat has shared an intriguing chart reading that shows the next milestones for ADA. With a combination of Fibonacci Levels and Gann Fan analysis, he pinpoints several crucial levels, with a possible top between $6 and $8 at the peak of the cycle.

On the technical front, Cardano continues to make strides, as the upgrade for the Daedalus wallet was launched today. Daedalus v7.0.0 will introduce several bug fixes and optimization, an improved interface, and enhanced governance options

Sui Clears New All-Time High, But It’s Not Done YetSui (SUI) continues to rise undeterred, as it showed remarkable resilience during the previous days’ downturn. After sweeping the lows, Sui rallied once again and reached a new all-time high of $4.88. to a new peak. Currently, Sui trades at $4.78 with a 4.4% intraday increase, bringing its monthly gains to a noteworthy 44%.

This Sui surge has been catalyzed by a series of bullish announcements, which have also led to a new peak in DEX volume, surpassing $466 million and $1.8 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL).

Recently, Sui started a partnership with Ant Digital Technologies to tokenize ESG-backed real-world assets. The goal is to integrate these assets within Sui’s blockchain ecosystem and expand access for institutional investors across the globe.

Why Cutoshi Could Surprise Everyone In 2025Cutoshi is already making waves in the meme coin space with its unique ecosystem that leverages DeFi utility, providing a 360-degree cross-chain experience to users who are tired of switching between single-chain protocols when trading across multiple blockchains.

CUTO DEX is Cutoshi’s flagship feature. This is a non-custodial decentralized exchange that removes the middlemen from the equation and allows users to have exclusive control over their funds. This approach distances Cutoshi from the framework of centralized exchanges championing the ideals of privacy and decentralization, echoing the teachings of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.

Moreover, via the Cutoshi Farming initiative investors will have the opportunity to earn income by participating in special events and completing fun missions. The goal of these missions is to raise awareness about the project and expand its reach on social media. In exchange, users will receive Cuto points that can be later redeemed for $CUTO tokens post-presale

In stage 4 of the $CUTO presale, tokens sell for just $0.031, meaning that there has never been a better time to get involved, as the next price surge could happen sooner than expected.
