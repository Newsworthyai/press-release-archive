# CURE ALZHEIMER’S FUND EARNS PERFECT SCORE AND 13th CONSECUTIVE 
FOUR-STAR RATING FROM CHARITY NAVIGATOR

Cure Alzheimer’s Fund (CureAlz) is proud to announce the organization has achieved a 100% perfect score and Four-Star rating — its 13th consecutive top star rating — from Charity Navigator.

“Receiving a perfect score from Charity Navigator and Four-Star rating for 13 years in a row is a testament to our commitment to responsible stewardship of the donations entrusted to us. Our high-integrity business practices and financial controls mean we welcome full transparency about how we maximize the research impact of every dollar given to CureAlz,” said Meg Smith, Cure Alzheimer’s Fund CEO. “Donors to CureAlz can be confident their donations fund the field’s leading scientists to explore bold ideas and make game-changing discoveries to bring an end to Alzheimer’s disease.”

Charity Navigator, the nation’s largest independent evaluator of nonprofits, analyzes organizations based on four key metrics: Impact and Measurement, Accountability and Finance, Culture and Community, and Leadership and Adaptability. CureAlz, which invests 100% of every general donation into its research program, has received a perfect score across all four domains. According to Charity Navigator, less than one-tenth of one percent of charities rated by them earn a perfect score.

A Four-Star rating designates Cure Alzheimer’s Fund an official “Give with Confidence” charity, indicating that the organization is highly impactful in its given cause area, is fiscally responsible and transparent, and follows leadership and organizational culture best practices. Charity Navigator has provided more than 11 million donors with thorough and credible ratings of more than 230,000 organizations since 2001.

“We are delighted to provide Cure Alzheimer’s Fund with third-party accreditation that validates their operational excellence,” said Michael Thatcher, president and CEO of Charity Navigator. “The Four-Star rating is the highest possible rating an organization can achieve. We are eager to see the good work that CureAlz can accomplish in the years ahead.”

Cure Alzheimer’s Fund is a nonprofit dedicated to funding the most promising research to prevent, slow or reverse Alzheimer’s disease. Since its founding in 2004, Cure Alzheimer’s Fund has provided 917 grants to more than 300 of the world’s leading researchers and contributed more than $219 million to research. Its funded initiatives have been responsible for many key breakthroughs in understanding the causes and pathology of Alzheimer’s disease. Cure Alzheimer’s Fund has achieved a 100% perfect score and has received a Four-Star rating for 13 consecutive years from Charity Navigator. Cure Alzheimer’s Fund also received a Platinum Seal of Transparency from Candid, formerly known as GuideStar. Our Board of Directors, Trustees and a core group of other donors direct their donations to our overhead expenses so that 100% of general donations go to our research program.
