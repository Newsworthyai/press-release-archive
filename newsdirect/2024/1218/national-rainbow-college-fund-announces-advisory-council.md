# National Rainbow College Fund Announces Advisory Council

National Rainbow College Fund, which is powered by San Diego Foundation (SDF), today announced the formation of its Advisory Council.

The Advisory Council is composed of prominent community members who bring their expertise, passion and diverse perspectives to guide the first scholarship designed to exclusively support LGBTQ+ students pursuing their ambitions for higher education regardless of the public nature of their sexual identity.

"Now, more than ever, LGBTQ+ students face unique challenges such as social acceptance, mental health issues and family rejection that can hinder their ability to afford college and impact their long-term economic stability and mobility," said Mark Stuart, SDF President and CEO. "Starting with California in 2025, our vision is that every LGBTQ+ person in the U.S. has the means to realize their educational dreams. I am honored to work with our Advisory Council to support these students and nurture the next generation of leaders.”

Advisory Council members include SDF President and CEO Mark Stuart; American Red Cross Senior Vice President for International Services and Services to Armed Forces Jarrett Barrios; Sycamore Tree Capital Partners Managing Director Amanda Montgomery; University of California at San Diego Vice Chancellor for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Dr. Becky Petitt; Former Sempra Energy Chief Human Resources Officer Joyce Rowland and Cox Communications Government Affairs Manager Allen Young.

Advisory Council members will support the National Rainbow College Fund with advocacy, community relations, guidance, strategy and fundraising. They will also evaluate scholarship applications alongside a team of volunteers.
