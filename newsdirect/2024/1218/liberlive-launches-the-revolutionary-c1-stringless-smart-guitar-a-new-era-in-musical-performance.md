A Brand that Fosters Creative Expression

Since its founding in 2019, LiberLive has remained committed to one core mission: to connect people with music in innovative and meaningful ways. The launch of the LiberLive C1 Stringless Smart Guitar represents a significant advancement in the company's efforts to revolutionize the way we learn, play, create, and perform music.

At its core, LiberLive believes that music is a universal language - a force that transcends boundaries, connects people, and brings joy to millions. Since the beginning, the company has been focused on creating instruments and technologies that break down the traditional barriers of music-making, making it easier for anyone to express themselves and explore their musical potential.

The Mission: Connecting People Through Music

The company's name reflects its mission: Liberate Your Music Live. With the world's first stringless guitar, LiberLive is bringing that mission to life by providing a completely new and intuitive way for people to connect with their musical side.

"At LiberLive, we truly believe that music is for everyone. Our mission is to break down the barriers that make music hard to access, allowing people of all skill levels to connect with music. Our LiberLive C1 embodies this vision." says Vincent Tang, the founder of LiberLive, "It’s not just a guitar; it’s a stringless, self-contained, digital instrument that gives users the freedom to explore and connect with music. Ultimately, we’re here to make music more accessible and engaging for everyone.”

A Revolutionary Approach to Stringless Smart Guitar

What sets the LiberLive C1 apart from traditional instruments is its stringless design and smart technology. Using advanced tactile sensors and MicroDAW Sampling Synthesis combined with Frequency Simulation Technology, the LiberLive C1 delivers incredibly authentic sounds without relying on traditional strings or amplifiers. This means that users can produce guitar, bass, piano, and drum sounds with perfect accuracy and rich, immersive quality.

The LiberLive App enhances this experience, providing users with real-time feedback, interactive sheet music, and the ability to adjust pitch, effects, and rhythms. Whether users want to explore new soundscapes or create entirely new compositions, the LiberLive C1 puts the power of music creation at their fingertips.

A Bridge Between Creative Minds and Digital Innovation

The LiberLive C1 isn’t just about technology for its own sake; it’s about using technology to bring people closer to music. For LiberLive, it’s not about replacing traditional instruments, but rather, enhancing and evolving the musical experience. The LiberLive C1 enables everyone to connect more freely with their music by giving them the tools to explore new sounds, experiment with different styles, and push the boundaries of their creativity.

Since its inception, LiberLive has garnered attention for its innovative designs and commitment to pushing the boundaries of music technology. The LiberLive C1 Stringless Smart Guitar has already won prestigious design awards like the Red Dot Product Design Award and IF Design Award. Its status as a pioneer in stringless smart guitar innovation has been further strengthened by the patent it received for its folding design.
