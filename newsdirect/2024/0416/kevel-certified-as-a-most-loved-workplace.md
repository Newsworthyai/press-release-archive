James Avery, Kevel CEO and Founder

Kevel has been certified as a Most Loved Workplace® because of its dedication to being a true people-first organization where vulnerability, authenticity and transparency are encouraged and valued. The Kevel team aims to build an environment where every employee feels respected, welcomed and heard. As a remote first organization, Kevel is focused on providing a highly communicative and collaborative environment that enables flexibility and autonomy for its employees. Kevel strives to promote from within and ensure that every employee has the opportunity to reach their full potential.

The Most Loved Workplace accreditation certifies companies where employees are the happiest and most satisfied at work. Kevel became certified as a Most Loved Workplace based on its scores on the Love of Workplace Index™, which surveyed employees on various elements around employee satisfaction and sentiment including the level of respect, collaboration, support, and sense of belonging they feel inside the company.

"I started Most Loved Workplaces out of inspiration from my community of people who consciously place love for their employees at the center of their business model," said Louis Carter, the founder, and CEO of BPI and a social/organizational psychologist, thought leader, entrepreneur, and author. Carter's book, "In Great Company: How to Spark Peak Performance by Creating an Emotionally Connected Workplace," identifies the specific areas needed to become a highly respected, reputable organization where people love to work with each other – a Most Loved Workplace.

Backed by BPI, in its original research that created MLW criteria, Most Loved Workplaces surveyed more than 175 companies and more than 3,000 executives across the United States, the Middle East/Northern Africa, and Southeast Asia. They found that productivity rises as employee sentiment increases, with 94 percent of responders saying they did three to four times more work for a company they loved and 95 percent saying they stayed at companies they loved three to four times longer. The Most Loved Workplace certification is the most valid method to determine employee experience and recognize a great workplace.
