# PathAI Partners with Google Cloud to Transform Drug Discovery and Precision Medicine Through AI-Powered Pathology

--News Direct--

PathAI, a global leader in AI-powered pathology, today announced a strategic partnership with Google Cloud at Bio-IT World Conference & Expo to help biopharma companies and anatomic pathology (AP) labs accelerate the adoption of AI and digital pathology.

PathAI’s AISight1 Intelligent Image Management System (IMS) is an AI-native IMS that seamlessly blends PathAI and third-party algorithms into a single laboratory workflow and image analysis platform, providing researchers and pathologists direct access to powerful biomarker quantification tools that have the potential to increase lab operational efficiency and aid in disease staging and scoring. PathAI will leverage Google Cloud’s infrastructure to bring AISight to more biopharma companies and AP labs worldwide, enabling faster deployments of novel AI models for a variety of clinical and research needs.

"Bio-IT World is where pioneers convene to address the industry's most significant challenges, including how to leverage massive scale data from biological and clinical studies to accelerate the discovery and development of transformative new therapies for patients. PathAI partners across the drug development paradigm, firstly with biopharma by enabling the development of new insights and diagnostics and supporting global clinical trials through PathAI’s AISight Clinical Trials platform, trial-ready algorithms, and Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) compliant laboratory; and also with AP labs ensuring scaled access to algorithms through AISight," said Dr. Andy Beck, CEO and co-founder of PathAI. "Our partnership with Google Cloud helps us transform our capabilities to accelerate adoption of these powerful tools and ultimately reshape how disease is understood and treated.”

The partnership will involve the integration of PathAI’s AISight solution with Google Cloud's infrastructure and AI capabilities, providing:

Accelerated adoption of precision medicine solutions: Google Cloud's infrastructure enables rapid scaling of AISight's digital pathology IMS and algorithmic capabilities globally, aiding digital pathology laboratory operations and researchers in processing petabytes worth of data for large-scale biomarker discovery and clinical studies, ultimately bringing advancements to patients more quickly.

Customized solutions and tailored AI models: The latest Google Cloud AI tools within the AISight platform provide the ability to quickly develop customized solutions and deploy novel AI models tailored to specific research needs.

"We understand the urgent need within the biopharmaceutical industry for secure, scalable solutions in AI-driven drug discovery, laboratory operations, and biomarker quantification,” said Ryan Terry, managing director, Healthcare and Life Sciences, Google Cloud. "We're incredibly excited to partner with PathAI to create a new wave of solutions that leverage precision medicine to help solve the industry’s most significant challenges."
