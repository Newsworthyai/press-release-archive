# European Green Transition reaches new milestones at Olserum rare earths project in Sweden

--News Direct--

European Green Transition PLC (AIM:EGT) CEO Aiden Lavelle takes Proactive's Stephen Gunnion through latest developments at the company's rare earths project in Sweden.

Lavelle highlighted a community meeting held last week that aimed to engage local stakeholders. The meeting involved a geology review and explanations of the planned drilling operations at the Olserum site. Lavelle emphasized the project's alignment with the EU's strategy on critical raw materials and its importance in securing domestic supplies. The community responded positively to the project’s potential benefits, Lavelle said.

Additionally, Lavelle mentioned the successful conclusion of consultations for drill permitting, which fits well with the company’s timeline. Drilling is scheduled to start in August, following the July summer holidays in Sweden. This timeline allows the company to proceed with exploration drilling and resource infill drilling as planned.

The Swedish Geological Survey's recent involvement was also discussed. They visited the site to assess the new exploration model developed by European Green Transition. This model has been updated based on recent fieldwork, including rock sampling and magnetic surveys, revealing new mineralization areas and enhancing the geological understanding of the region. This visit aligns with their broader efforts to map the geology of Kalmar County, which is expected to continue over the next few years.
