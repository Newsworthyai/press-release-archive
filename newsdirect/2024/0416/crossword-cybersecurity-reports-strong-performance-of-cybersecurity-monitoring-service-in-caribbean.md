# Crossword Cybersecurity reports strong performance of cybersecurity monitoring service in Caribbean

--News Direct--

Crossword Cybersecurity PLC (AIM:CCS) group managing director Stuart Jubb tells Proactive's Stephen Gunnion that the company's Nightingale cybersecurity monitoring service performed well in the first quarter after expanding into the Caribbean.

Jubb told Proactive the company has established a partnership with a local cybersecurity firm founded by entrepreneurs, addressing a significant gap in cybersecurity support in the region. This partnership has led to significant contracts with major companies in the Caribbean, enhancing Crossword's presence and reputation locally.

Nightingale is a monitoring software installed in data centres to oversee laptops and PCs, providing early warnings of any unusual access patterns, which can indicate potential security threats. This service is becoming increasingly crucial as Caribbean countries, with growing international business interests and natural resources, begin to recognise the importance of cybersecurity.

The local partner, now a preferred security provider, is also offering consultancy services, aiding companies in developing comprehensive cybersecurity strategies. This approach mirrors Crossword's successful strategies in other markets, with plans to replicate this model in additional English-speaking and Commonwealth countries.
