Braces are often a coming-of-age experience for many young children – and potentially simultaneously a financial burden for their parents. In today’s market, the average cost of metal braces, which are the cheapest option available, is $3,000 to $7,000. However, these ranges can go up to around $10,000 if there is more extensive work needed or a preference for ceramic or lingual braces.

Summertime is often the preferred time for children and parents alike to start the braces journey. Without school, appointments are much easier to make without stressing that children are missing valuable classroom time. Overall, summertime is marked by fewer worries, fewer obligations and more time to adjust to the new braces.

With summer right around the corner, many parents are starting to balance budgets to ensure their children get the oral care they need. While many may assume that dental insurance will cover the cost, this is rarely the reality. The majority of dental insurance plans have an annual maximum spending limit of $1,000-$2,000 and may even have a lifetime limit on coverage for orthodontics. At best, a portion of the overall cost will be covered, but check your plan details since coverage varies.

Dental Savings Plans As An Alternative That’s where dental savings plans can provide relief for millions of American families, as a trusted and affordable alternative to dental insurance. A dental savings plan is a subscription-based program that provides plan members with discounts on dental services from participating dentists and orthodontists.

Unlike dental insurance, which typically involves monthly premiums, copayments, deductibles and coverage limits, dental savings plans work on a fee-for-service basis. Dental savings plans typically provide around 20% off braces, which can be more than $1,000 in savings per person. For all other procedures, dental savings plans typically result in savings of 10%-60% and there is no limit to how much you can use these plans, unlike dental insurance which has finite yearly caps.

DentalPlans.com is celebrating its 25th anniversary and has prided itself on helping over a million customers save on their dental care since its launch in 1999. The company started as an online marketplace for dental savings plans but has now expanded to offer both dental savings plans and insurance.

In 2023, the company launched an online plan finder, which asks users a few quick questions and then provides them with a personalized plan recommendation in minutes. With so many different types of plans available, the online plan finder can be a lifesaver for parents who want the best care for their children. There is also a search feature where they can look for dentists, orthodontists, and see which plans are accepted by those practitioners.

Instead of being overwhelmed by the plethora of plans available online or feeling deterred and not knowing where to begin planning, DentalPlans.com makes it simple and hassle-free.
