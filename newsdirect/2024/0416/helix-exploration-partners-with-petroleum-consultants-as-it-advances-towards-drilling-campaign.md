--News Direct--

Helix Exploration PLC chairman David Minchin discusses a strategic partnership with Petroleum Consultants in an interview with Proactive's Stephen Gunnion. This collaboration is part of Helix's phase-one work programme, aimed at progressing its drilling campaign at the Ingomar Dome, slated for the third quarter of this year.

Minchin highlighted the partnership's critical role in leveraging the firm's local presence in Billings, Montana, and its extensive network of contacts, which will enable rapid and cost-effective service delivery. The expertise of Petroleum Consultants, coupled with the experience of Helix CEO Bo Sears, who possesses nearly 25 years of experience in helium exploration, is expected to ensure the safe and successful delivery of the upcoming drilling campaign.

Additionally, Minchin outlined the next steps in the companyâ€™s appraisal well programme, which includes signing binding contracts with service providers and initiating advanced engineering and construction with the goal of producing gas by the end of 2025.
