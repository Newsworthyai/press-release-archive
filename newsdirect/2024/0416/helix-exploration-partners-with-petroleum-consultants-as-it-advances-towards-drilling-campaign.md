Helix Exploration PLC chairman David Minchin discusses a strategic partnership with Petroleum Consultants in an interview with Proactive's Stephen Gunnion. This collaboration is part of Helix's phase-one work programme, aimed at progressing its drilling campaign at the Ingomar Dome, slated for the third quarter of this year.
