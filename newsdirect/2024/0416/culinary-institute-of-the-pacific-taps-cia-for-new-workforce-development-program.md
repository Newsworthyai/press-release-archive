About Culinary Institute of Pacific

The programs at The Culinary Institute of the Pacific (CIP) at Kapiʻolani Community College planted its roots in 1946, then known as the “Hotel and Restaurant” program, under the Territorial Department of Public Instruction located at the Palama Settlement facilities. Since then, the program has moved from the Ala Wai Clubhouse to the Pensacola Campus to where it currently stands along the slopes of Lē‘ahi. The program has recently expanded its footprint to include the Culinary Institute of the Pacific at Diamond Head where two state-of-the-art culinary laboratories have been built and will soon be home to three prized facility additions: a Tasting Studio, the Food Creativity Center, and the highly anticipated CIP restaurant. The CIP program prides itself as a conduit for supporting the State of Hawai‘i’s culinary industry through a multitude of educational avenues, both short and long term, including bachelor’s degree transfer pathways, associate degrees, certificates, workforce development, and non-credit programming. The Culinary Institute of the Pacific programs extend across the University of Hawaiʻi Community Colleges System including programs at Leeward Community College, Kauaʻi Community College, Maui College, and Hawaiʻi Community College.
