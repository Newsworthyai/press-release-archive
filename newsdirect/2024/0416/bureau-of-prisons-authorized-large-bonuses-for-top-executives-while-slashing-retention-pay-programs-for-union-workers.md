# Bureau of Prisons authorized large bonuses for top executives while slashing retention pay programs for union workers

--News Direct--

The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) continues its pattern of lining the pockets of top executives while slashing the pay for line-level union workers nationwide.

While top BOP executives, administrators, and wardens enjoy significant bonuses, line-level public safety union workers continue to bear the brunt of indiscriminate pay cuts and slashed retention pay programs.

At FCI Thomson (IL), line-level workers were informed just before Christmas 2023 that their 25% retention pay would be slashed. Meanwhile failed wardens and other management staff would receive $14,000 - $30,000 in bonuses and compensation.

A FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) revealed these bonuses were paid out in 2023 while the retention pay was cut at FCI Thomson: Former FCI Thomson Warden Thomas Bergami received a $14,000 bonus, $20,000 was paid to Acting Assistant Director Alix M. McClearen, and a $30,000 top bonus was paid to North Central Regional Director Andre Matevousian.

While BOP Director Colette Peters begs for pennies, testifying before Congress that “our officers do not get paid enough,” her administration seems extremely adamant in ensuring her BOP executives are receiving executive bonuses while slashing pay for Union workers.

This is a renewed call for the Federal Prison Oversight Act to ensure appropriate allocations of BOP funds. More Info here: https://www.ossoff.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sen-ossoffs-bipartisan-bill-to-overhaul-federal-prison-oversight-passes-key-u-s-house-committee/
