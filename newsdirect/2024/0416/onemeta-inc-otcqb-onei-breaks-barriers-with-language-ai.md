# OneMeta Inc. (OTCQB: ONEI) Breaks Barriers with Language AI

--News Direct--

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the global economic landscape, driving productivity, global growth, and income worldwide, according to the International Monetary Fund. As AI technology becomes increasingly prevalent across various industries, several AI stocks are positioned to benefit from this transformation. Companies are leveraging AI to boost productivity and maintain a competitive edge, with applications in software development, customer service, pharmaceutical research, and creative design.

The Natural Language Processing (NLP) market is experiencing rapid growth, projected to reach $36.42 billion in 2024 with a CAGR of 27.55% between 2024 and 2030. The United States leads this market, boasting the largest market size.

OneMeta Inc. (OTCQB: ONEI) is making notable strides in the NLP segment. OneMeta specializes in multilingual enablement, aiming to break down communication barriers across a world that speaks over 7,100 languages. Utilizing proprietary end-to-end NLP architecture developed through generative AI, OneMeta’s technology can synthesize, translate, and transcribe spoken and written words in less than one second.

Last year, OneMeta announced the launch of VerbumCall, an AI-powered phone-to-phone language translation service that boasts an impressive accuracy rate of over 94%. VerbumCall leverages OneMeta’s proprietary VerbumOS, or the Adaptive Multilingual Recognition System, to generate precise translations and transcripts across 152 languages in less than a second. This service has broad applications, including healthcare, education, government, geopolitical, and customer service call centers, potentially transforming industries and fostering a more connected world.

This collaboration allows users of Microsoft Teams to communicate in over 140 languages simultaneously, offering seamless translation and transcription capabilities. As a result, OneMeta's Verbum software was listed on the Microsoft Azure Marketplace and the Microsoft AppSource Marketplace, expanding the company’s market presence and accessibility to potential customers.

Additional Recently, ONEI expanded its presence on Microsoft’s corporate websites by listing its Verbum software on the Teams Store, AppSource Marketplace, Azure Marketplace, and Microsoft’s documentation library. This strategic move allows Microsoft Teams Enterprise users to easily access OneMeta's multilingual solutions, further promoting the adoption of the company's offerings.

Move to OTCQB

Further demonstrating the company’s growth, OneMeta announced ONEI was approved to move up to the OTCQB venture market on March 5, 2024, allowing more brokerage firms to buy and sell the company's common shares. This uplisting provides OneMeta with increased liquidity and strengthens its position as an SEC reporting company committed to keeping its shareholders informed.

Chestnutt brings a wealth of experience in operations, corporate strategy, and business development, particularly from his time as Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer at Verizon. His extensive background in the telecommunications industry positions OneMeta for growth in the competitive AI market.

In addition to Chestnutt, ONEI also appointed Tim Fisher as Senior Vice-President of Sales.

His strategic enterprise sales experience and track record of achieving substantial revenue growth make him a valuable asset to the company.
