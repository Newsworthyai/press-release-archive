# Clarified Precision Medicine Raises $1.2 Million in Seed Funding and Appoints Health Tech Leader Rajni Natesan, MD, MBA as CEO

--News Direct--

Clarified Precision Medicine, the only company that provides oncologists with prioritized therapy options via a combination of algorithmic testing and physician oversight, announced that it closed on its seed round of $1.2 million led by Avestria Ventures, with participation from Joyance Partners, both early-stage funds focused on improving health. The company also named Rajni Natesan, MD, MBA as its Chief Executive Officer.

Dr. Natesan is an experienced executive and medical doctor with an extensive background scaling startups at the intersection of healthcare and technology, with a focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning.

“Clarified Precision Medicine is offering the right technology at the right time,” Dr. Natesan said. “I’m excited to guide Clarified through this period of commercialization and growth as we follow through on our mission to provide any patient, anywhere, with cutting-edge, guidelines-based access to precision medicine.”

Founded in 2021 by Dr. Lincoln Nadauld, MD, PhD, Lisa Alderson, MBA, Howard McLeod, PharmD, and Jody Simon, PharmD, Clarified Precision Medicine uses an algorithm to analyze NGS lab results and then works with oncologists to interpret genomic test results to recommend the best targeted treatment. In the United States, there are 18 million patients with a history of cancer and 1.9 million new cancer diagnoses each year. Patients who receive precision therapies have survival rates that are three times greater than those who do not.

However, 75 percent of doctors say they need help interpreting genomic tests—which leads to more effective utilization of these powerful 21-century tools. Clarified’s combination of advanced technology and physician oversight provides oncologists at community cancer centers with the precision treatment knowledge and expertise usually reserved for leading research institutions.

“Dr. Natesan is the perfect leader to help us scale Clarified Precision Medicine to ensure that oncology practices across the country have access to expert guidance to deliver improved outcomes,” said Clarified Precision Medicine Co-founder Lisa Alderson. “She has the right combination of business acumen and clinical expertise to drive adoption and engage with key stakeholders to make world-class precision medicine expertise accessible to every cancer patient and every oncology practice. We’re excited to support Dr. Natesan as she leads us into the next chapter of growth.”

With deep C-suite expertise in finance, strategy, operations and clinical functions across medical devices and health tech, Dr. Natesan has led companies across all phases of their product and organizational life cycles, from conceptual design to FDA trials, commercialization, IP and M&A preparation. Dr. Natesan began her career as one of the first physicians on Wall Street, leading health care mergers, acquisitions and financing deals for pharma, biotech and med device clients as an investment banker in Lehman Brothers’ health care group and as a health care strategy consultant in a boutique practice. Most recently, Dr. Natesan served as Chief Strategy and Medical Officer at Braid Health, a venture-backed, disruptive digital health infrastructure company.

Clarified Precision Medicine is already supporting numerous U.S. oncology practices and testing labs and offers flexible payment options, including direct insurance billing in some cases.
