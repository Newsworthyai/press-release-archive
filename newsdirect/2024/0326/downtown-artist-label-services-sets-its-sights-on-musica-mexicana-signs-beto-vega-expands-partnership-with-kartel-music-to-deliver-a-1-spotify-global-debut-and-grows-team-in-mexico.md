--News Direct--

Achieving a 65% increase in Musica Mexicana and Latin Hip Hop genre music in its catalog, Downtown Artist & Label Services continues to set its sights on rapid expansion in the market. This is evident through the team’s recent signing of renowned singer/songwriter, Beto Vega and its expanded partnership with powerhouse record label, Kartel Music. The company has also seen a significant growth of staff in the region over the last two years, including the promotion of Daniela Gutiérrez to Senior Marketing Manager and the hiring of Lorena Cabral as Senior Manager, A&R for Mexico.

Nominated in 2018 for Best Regional Mexican Music Album at the Latin Grammy Awards for 'Volveré A Ser El Rey', acclaimed singer/songwriter Beto Vega will benefit from Downtown Artist & Label Services’ bespoke global distribution and marketing offering. The multi-million streamed artist behind popular collaboration ‘Me Dicen Nini’ with Markitos Toys will also utilize the company’s catalog management and full-service campaigns for future releases, including forthcoming track, “Los Brothers” with Edgardo Nuñez.

Establishing itself as a market leader within the territory, Downtown Artist & Label Services has seen a wealth of success and high-profile signings in Musica Mexicana over the last few years. Most notably, the last 12 months of Musica Mexicana tagged songs in Downtown’s catalog increased in streams by 65%, with an average of over 200 million daily streams, which includes YouTube views, of those genres. With longstanding clients, Alzada Music - home to the late Lefty SM, Yoss Bones, Neto Peña, Tose One and Zxmyr - Delux Music Group (Daniel Garcia and Erick B) and Master Q (Los Tucanes de Tijuana), already part of its noteworthy roster, the company recently drove exceptional campaign results for renowned record label, Kartel Music, whose client, top-selling musician and composer, Luis R. Conriquez, hit #1 on Spotify’s Top Albums Debut with album Corridos Bélicos, Vol. IV. The album also became the highest-charting new release on the Billboard 200 of the week.

Carlos Santos, Label Manager of Kartel Music comments, “The industry vets at Downtown have been a great team for us to distribute and market our artists' music, and we’re always happy to work with them. The work they have done for projects like Luis R. Conriquez makes us feel comfortable and confident in their skills - we always feel prepared, and know that while working with them, we're always ready for what's next.”

As Downtown Artist & Label Services continues to expand and serve on the frontlines of the Musica Mexicana movement, the company has seen significant growth across its local workforce. Joining the company as Senior Manager, A&R for the territory is Monterrey-based Lorena Cabral, who will be leading efforts on the ground to develop emerging and established talent, beginning with the signing of Beto Vega. Cabral reports directly to Global Vice President of A&R, Bryan Mooney.

Cabral joins Daniella Gutiérrez - who was recently promoted to Senior Marketing Manager for the region - reporting to the VP of Marketing, Geoff Halliday. Also joining the local workforce are Yusim Aladro and Frida Bolio, who are Latin Project Manager and Regional Account Manager respectively, both based in Mexico City.

President of Downtown Artist & Label Services, Ben Patterson comments, ‘I'm passionate about Downtown's all-hands focus on Musica Mexicana. With Ray and Daniela receiving additional support from Lorena, Yusim and Frida, we were able to kick start 2024 with an explosive release of Luis R. Conriquez's Corridos Belicos IV via Kartel Music that was the highest charting new release on the Billboard 200. With our team expanding and continued worldwide investment in our artist services we're able to give new signings like Beto Vega a global team that champions and supports his creative vision."
