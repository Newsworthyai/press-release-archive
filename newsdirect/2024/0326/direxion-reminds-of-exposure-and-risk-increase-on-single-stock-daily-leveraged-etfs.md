# Direxion Reminds of Exposure and Risk Increase on Single Stock Daily Leveraged ETFs

--News Direct--

Direxion announced on February 2, 2024, it will increase the leverage point and risk level of six single stock ETFs. The changes will heighten the risk of any investment in a Fund because they will result in an increase in the Fund's leverage. Currently, the six single stock ETFs seek daily leveraged investment results, before fees and expenses, of 150% of the daily performance of each ETF’s underlying security. (“1.5X”). Effective on or around April 2, 2024, each of the ETFs will seek daily leveraged investment results, before fees and expenses, of 200% of the daily performance of the ETF’s underlying security (“2X”).

Because each Fund will seek to magnify the daily performance of its respective underlying security to a greater extent under its new investment objective, each Fund will have the potential for greater gains, but will also be subject to the risk of greater losses relative to the performance of each Fund's respective underlying security.

Leveraged and Inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying stock’s performance over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by sophisticated investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments. Investing in the Funds is not equivalent to investing directly in the underlying security.

An investor should carefully consider a Fund’s investment objective, risks, charges, and expenses before investing. A Fund’s prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other information about the Direxion Shares. To obtain a prospectus and summary prospectus call 866-476-7523 or visit our website at direxion.com. A Fund’s prospectus and summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing.

Direxion Shares Risks - An investment in the ETFs involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The ETFs are non-diversified and include risks associated with concentration that results from an ETF’s investments in a particular industry, sector or company, which can increase volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. The ETFs do not attempt to, and should not be expected to, provide returns which are a multiple of respective underlying security for periods other than a single day. For other risks including leverage, correlation, daily compounding, market volatility and risks specific to an industry, sector or company, please read the prospectus. Please see the summary and full prospectuses for a more complete description of these and other risks of the Fund.
