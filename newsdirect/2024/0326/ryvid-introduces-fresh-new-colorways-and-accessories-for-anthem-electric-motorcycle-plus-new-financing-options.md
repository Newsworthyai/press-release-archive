# Ryvid introduces fresh new Colorways and Accessories for Anthem Electric Motorcycle, plus new Financing options

--News Direct--

Following last month’s announcement of a complete 3D parts catalog available to owners of the American-built Ryvid Anthem electric motorcycle, the California-based company is continuing to expand at a phenomenal rate.

The month of March is filled to the brim with announcements, headlined by two new colors for the 2024 Ryvid Anthem, including the distinctive Photon Blue and Plasma Yellow. These colorways join the existing line up of Galactica Black, Rapid White, Carbon Grey and Atomic Gold, expanding customer choice to six desirable colors.

And thanks to the 3D Parts Catalog at ryvid.com, existing Anthem owners will be able to purchase body panels in the latest colors or even mix and match. The vibrant new Photon Blue and Plasma Yellow are perfect for the Spring and Summer, helping to ensure the clean lines of the Ryvid Anthem really stand out.

ACCESSORIES

Another new Ryvid initiative is its Accessories range, which will enable owners to personalize and customize their Anthem. As a special incentive for new owners, Ryvid is offering a $350 Accessories Bundle Credit for anyone purchasing an Anthem before April 15, 2024, allowing the new Accessories to be supplied with the bike.

The Accessories are intended to make the electric motorcycle more convenient for users, providing a frequently-requested cargo rack, for example, which can carry up to 25 lb. The rack takes advantage of the threaded holes in every Anthem frame, which were always intended to fulfil this function.

Other useful Accessories include a phone mount, Level 2 charging adapter, and helmet lock. Owners can also choose to change the color of their Anthem seat and bodywork or order a replacement battery.

The full list of new Ryvid Accessories includes the following:

* Anthem Rear Rack - $195
* Handlebar Phone mount - $55
* Anthem Charging Cable 110V - $25
* Anthem Charging Cable 220V - $40
* Level 2 J-plug Charging Adapter - $95
* Anthem 4.3 kWh Battery Pack with Integrated Fast Charger - $3995
* Anthem Seat (4 color options) - $250
* Helmet Cable Lock - $35
* Power Controller Upgraded by ASI - $995

The high-performance Power Controller Upgrade by ASI is a simple plug-n-play swap, allowing Anthem owners can enjoy a 30% increase in acceleration without sacrificing range. The ASI Controller Kit includes a wiring harness that plugs straight into the Anthem. DIY installation instructions are available for new and existing Anthem motorcycles. Customers who order the ASI Controller with a new Anthem will only pay a discounted $800 for the controller once it’s ready to ship in April.

FINANCE PLANS

By popular demand, Ryvid has partnered with FreedomRoad Financial to offer competitive rates and extended term financing options. To see if an applicant qualifies, they simply click the “I Want to Finance” option on the Anthem page at ryvid.com and a member of the Lightning Squad will walk them through the process.

The introduction of the new San Bernardino, CA factory facility has led to faster production schedules. This has not only allowed the company to ship the Anthem within four weeks of order completion, but customers can now select from four shipping options. This includes California collection and expedites national delivery to ensure new customers are enjoying the Anthem Electric as soon as possible.

At the point of purchase, all California residents will pay tax and registration prior to shipping, ensuring their Anthem is ready to go upon arrival. Residents of all other states will pay the applicable tax and registration at their local DMV.

SHOWS, DEMOS & MODEL LAUNCH

At the Mama Tried motorcycle show in Milwaukee, WI in February, Ryvid was not only an event sponsor but supported the entry of a modified Anthem by Thor Drake from SeeSee Motorcycles. Competing in the Ryvid-sponsored EV class race, he placed third after an exciting battle. Additionally, Ryvid displayed the Anthem and provided demo rides to show attendees.

Looking forward to April 19-21, Ryvid will be a title sponsor of The One Motorcycle Show in Portland, OR. There are big plans for this community event, which will again see the Anthem on display and available for demo rides.

As a custom motorcycle show, many customized Anthems will also be on display for the first time, inspiring current and future owners. However, the major news is that Ryvid will debut its brand-new electric motorcycle at The One Moto Show, giving visitors and attending media the chance to see this exciting new model in the flesh for the very first time.

More details will be revealed next month, but the groundbreaking concept will offer a revolutionary approach to motorcycle design, purchasing and customization. We can’t wait to reveal it to everybody at The One Moto Show and beyond.
