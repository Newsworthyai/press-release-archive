# Classiq Advances the HPC Quantum Computing Stack by Integrating Classiq’s Engine with NVIDIA CUDA-Q

--News Direct--

Classiq, a leader in quantum computing software, today announced it is integrating Classiq’s software with the NVIDIA CUDA-Q platform, which was announced by NVIDIA at its GTC conference last week. This integration facilitates a streamlined process for researchers working with CUDA-Q to generate, analyze and execute quantum circuits. It supports a wide range of quantum applications, including simulations and machine learning​​.

The Classiq true compilation technology enables quantum circuit synthesis that automates the implementation of quantum programs. This capability enables the development process for quantum software and ensures that the generated programs are finely tuned for execution on a broad range of quantum hardware, as well as NVIDIA GPUs.

Previously, NVIDIA, Rolls Royce and Classiq demonstrated a breakthrough in quantum computational fluid dynamics (CFD) by designing and simulating the largest quantum program to date. Classiq also launched a Quantum Computing for Life Sciences & Healthcare Center in collaboration with NVIDIA.

“Classiq’s technology lies at the heart of quantum computing and provides a powerful conduit between high-performance computing (HPC) users and quantum computing implementation,” said Nir Minerbi, CEO of Classiq. “We’re well-known for our popular quantum development platform, and this integration demonstrates Classiq’s focus on ensuring today’s CUDA-Q and HPC users benefit from seamless access to automatic production of optimized quantum and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms.”

Classiq is leveraging its technology to bridge HPC and quantum computation. From simulation to deploying hybrid quantum-classical algorithms to enhanced data processing, this convergence is accelerating as the two advanced computation sectors grow closer. Classiq provides the ideal combination of libraries, functions and automation to support this hybrid HPC-quantum computation space.

HPC and quantum computing are increasingly connected through the deployment of hybrid algorithms, co-location of hardware and an emerging talent pool of expert hybrid developers. Classiq makes quantum computing tools more accessible to the global research community, addressing the need to tackle complex problems across various domains such as healthcare, materials science, engineering and finance​​.

Meet Classiq next at the International Supercomputing 2024 conference running May 12-16th in Hamburg, Germany.
