Bitget, one of the world's largest crypto copy trading platforms, has partnered with Unstoppable Domains, a global leader in Web3 digital identity. This collaboration provides over 25M Bitget users with .bitget top-level domain (TLD) to provide Bitget's thriving community with a decentralized and distinct route to express their digital identities.

The introduction of the .bitget Top-Level Domain (TLD) represents a pivotal step forward in empowering users with the ability to establish a distinct and personalized digital presence. With this new feature, Bitget users are granted the opportunity to navigate to .bitget domains and reserve their preferred names, such as Sandy.bitget, and trader.bitget, effortlessly.

Owning a .bitget domain extends far beyond a mere digital address.

From simplifying crypto transactions with easily readable wallet addresses to logging into hundreds of apps, games, and metaverses, the .bitget on Unstoppable domain empowers users with a unique and secure digital identity. The domain can also be utilized to build decentralized websites, showcase on-chain achievements, and set a new standard in how users interact with the digital world.

This advancement aligns with Bitget's commitment to fostering the growth of cryptocurrency and delivering top-tier, innovative solutions within the rapidly evolving technological landscape.
