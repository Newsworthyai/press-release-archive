# Announcing the 50mm F1.2 DG DN | Art lens, the Brightest 50mm Prime Lens in SIGMA's Lineup

--News Direct--

SIGMA Corporation of America, the US subsidiary of SIGMA Corporation (CEO: Kazuto Yamaki. Headquarters: Asao-ku, Kawasaki-shi, Kanagawa, Japan) is pleased to announce the new SIGMA 50mm F1.2 DG DN | Art lens, a remarkably compact, ultra-fast standard prime lens for full-frame mirrorless camera systems. The new SIGMA 50mm F1.2 DG DN | Art is the brightest in the SIGMA 50mm prime lens lineup, while delivering extremely high optical performance from its widest aperture. It has achieved the highest level of performance among successive generations of Art lenses.

The F1.2 maximum aperture allows photographers to actively take advantage of the large bokeh effect and to shoot handheld with a wide aperture in low-light situations such as indoors and evening scenes. Thanks to the excellent correction of various aberrations such as spherical aberration, sagittal coma flare, and axial chromatic aberration, along with SIGMA's first 13-blade rounded diaphragm, which maintains a circular bokeh effect even when the aperture is stopped down, this lens delivers beautiful imaging characteristics.

Dual HLA-driven floating focusing, with one group near the front of the lens and one group near the back, provides stable optical performance from close to distant focus. The design also minimizes focus breathing, with very little change of the angle of view as focal distance changes, which is helpful for video capture. The dual floating HLA autofocus achieves focus smoothly, swiftly and silently for both still and video, and the manual focus ring can be assigned to be linear or non-linear response on compatible L-Mount cameras.

Despite the fast aperture, the SIGMA 50mm F1.2 DG DN | Art lens is has the lightest weight in its class*, and is 30% smaller than the SIGMA 35mm F1.2 DG DN | Art lens. It is very similar in size and weight to the SIGMA 50mm F1.4 DG DN | Art lens, which was achieved in part by streamlining the optical system.

* Full-frame mirrorless 50mm F1.2 lenses as of March 2024.

As a DG DN Art lens designed specifically for full-frame mirrorless camera systems, the SIGMA 50mm F1.2 DG DN | Art is built with dust and splash-resistant structure, water and oil-repellent coating on the front lens element, and durable brass bayonet mount; along with click/de-click and lockable aperture ring, an AFL button, and AF/MF switch.

Offered in L-Mount and Sony E-mount versions, the lens will be available on April 18, 2024 at a retail price of $1,399 through authorized retail partners.

The lightest in its class* â€• Bright F1.2 maximum aperture and the highest level of descriptive power from SIGMA's Art line.

SIGMA's Art line has been offering new possibilities and surprise for expression, and now the SIGMA 50mm F1.2 DG DN | Art is here to break the standards. SIGMA's focus with this lens is on the descriptive power that is perfectly usable from the widest aperture, and on portability that allows the high performance to be demonstrated in any field. In terms of image rendition, SIGMA achieved high resolving power from the maximum aperture throughout the entire focus range, while also enriching the beauty of the large bokeh effect at F1.2. In addition, the lens construction and mechanical design have been stripped down to the bare essentials, resulting in a significantly compact and lightweight body. The lens is also equipped with a full range of functions suitable for professional use, including high-precision AF using the latest HLA (High-response Linear Actuator) that reduces volume while maintaining the same thrust. We hope users will enjoy the superb Art F1.2, which will transform everything they capture and even their photographic experience into something extra special.

[Key Features]

1) Highest descriptive power to take advantage of F1.2 brightness

The SIGMA 50mm F1.2 DG DN | Art has been designed with an emphasis on high resolution from the maximum aperture to the full focus range and large, beautiful bokeh expression. The contrast between the sharpness of the focus surface and the melting bokeh effect creates a three-dimensional effect thanks to its F1.2 aperture. In addition, the 13-blade diaphragm allows for beautiful bokeh expressions. Focus breathing is also well-suppressed that the F1.2 rendering can be fully utilized in video recording.

Brightness of F1.2 maximum aperture and high resolution from minimum to infinity focus

The latest optical design achieves high resolving power with each aberration thoroughly suppressed from the maximum aperture. The lens is capable of rendering details without color bleeding in any situation. In addition, the incorporated floating focus is advantageous in improving short-range performance, ensuring a stable, high-level image quality throughout the entire range from the minimum focusing distance to infinity.

Rich and beautiful bokeh without color bleeding

By correcting spherical aberration, sagittal coma flare, axial chromatic aberration, and other aberrations, the lens delivers natural bokeh images that blur smoothly and without color bleeding from the focal plane. Double-line bokeh is also suppressed, allowing users to take advantage of the mellow bokeh effect in their expression.

Rounded diaphragm with 13 blades

The lens incorporates SIGMA's first 13-blade diaphragm, which maintains a circular shape even when stopped down from the maximum aperture. The surface accuracy of the aspherical lens has been enhanced to the utmost to enable smooth and beautiful round bokeh expressions.

Designed to minimize focus breathing

Optimization of the focus group arrangement and aspherical shape significantly suppresses focus breathing. The change in angle of view due to focus shift is minimized, creating a natural-looking focus shift when recording video.

Designed to minimize flare and ghosting

Flare and ghosting, which reduce image quality, are addressed under all conditions of incident light, based on the most advanced simulation technology. High backlight resistance enables clear and sharp images under any lighting conditions.

L2) Lightest lens body in its class*, suitable for a wide range of applications

By uncompromisingly pursuing high optical performance and portability, which are inherently contradictory, the highest level of performance has been condensed into the lightest lens body in its class. The SIGMA 50mm F1.2 DG DN | Art can be used not only in limited situations and applications, but in all kinds of shooting environments.

Dual HLA incorporating a new system

A new system was developed that significantly reduces the volume while maintaining the same thrust of the HLA, which is characterized by its high driving accuracy and quietness, and is featured in each of the two focus groups. This technological innovation has realized both high-speed autofocus and a compact lens body.

Lens construction and mechanical design stripped down to the absolute minimum

Each piece of glass is made as thin as possible while employing glasses with a high refractive index and four aspherical lenses. The high level of production technology at SIGMA's only manufacturing base, the Aizu factory, provides the exacting precision necessary for processing these thin glass elements and making this mass production possible. In addition, the floating focus ensures high performance while shortening the overall length, resulting in a compact lens. In the mechanical design phase, emphasis was placed on weight reduction. Through the systematic elimination of individual components, SIGMA attained the distinction of producing the lightest lens in its class, weighing a mere 745g / 26.3oz.*

3) A wealth of functions for professional use and excellent build quality

In addition to various functions that support photography, such as the AFL button* and an aperture ring, the construction of the lens body itself and its high-quality touch and feel are also pursued. The SIGMA 50mm F1.2 DG DN | Art is designed with high functionality and reliability to meet the stringent demands of professionals, as well as excellent build quality for long-lasting, reliable use.

* Function available on supported cameras only. Available functions may vary depending on the camera used.

Proud to be a tool of expression, excellent build quality with SIGMA's Art line specifications

By assembling high-precision parts made of lightweight and strong TSC* and other materials, the lens has the high level of rigidity and durability of SIGMA's Art line specifications without sacrificing portability, as well as excellent build quality that allows for long-lasting and reliable use as a photographic tool.

* TSC (Thermally Stable Composite) is a type of polycarbonate with a thermal expansion rate similar to that of aluminum. It has a high affinity to metal parts, which contributes to high quality product manufacturing.

Various shooting assist functions

The lens is equipped with an AFL button which can be assigned to a range of functions via the menu on selected cameras. In addition to the aperture ring, the lens is equipped with an aperture ring lock switch and a click switch to turn the click on and off.

Dust and splash resistant structure* and water and oil repellent coating

In addition to a dust and splash resistant structure, the front element of the lens features a water and oil repellent coating, allowing users to shoot without concerns even in harsh outdoor environments.

* The structure is designed to be dust and splash resistant, but not waterproof. Be careful not to bring the lens in contact with a large amount of water. Water inside the lens may cause major damage and even render the lens unrepairable.
