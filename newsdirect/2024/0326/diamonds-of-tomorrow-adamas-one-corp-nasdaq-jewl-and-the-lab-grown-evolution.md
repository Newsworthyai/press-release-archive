# Diamonds of Tomorrow: Adamas One Corp. (NASDAQ: JEWL) and the Lab-Grown Evolution

--News Direct--

In the realm of luxury, few items hold as much allure and fascination as natural diamonds. Yet, beneath their shimmering surface lies a shadow of environmental concerns and sustainability issues. With the global demand for diamonds soaring to unprecedented levels, questions about their ecological footprint have begun to loom large.

However, amidst this burgeoning awareness, a compelling alternative has emerged: lab-grown diamonds. Offering a sustainable and environmentally-friendly alternative to their mined counterparts, lab-grown diamonds have witnessed a meteoric rise in popularity among consumers.

The market for lab-grown diamonds is on an upward trajectory, fueled by increasing adoption in the fashion, jewelry, and industrial sectors. According to a report by Allied Market Research, the global lab-grown diamonds market was valued at $24.0 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach a staggering $59.2 billion by 2032, boasting a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.6%.

Enter Adamas One Corp. (NASDAQ: JEWL), a key player in the evolving landscape of the diamond industry. Positioned amidst a shift towards sustainability, Adamas One Corp. is at the forefront of pioneering greener practices in diamond production.

In January of last year, Adamas One unveiled its financial results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. The company's revenue milestone, exceeding $1.78 million in lab-grown diamond sales, marked a pivotal shift from research and development to commercial production. CEO Jay Grdina's strategic vision emphasized the importance of reaching full manufacturing capacity at the Greenville, S.C., facility by May 2023, laying the foundation for sustained growth.

Scaling for Growth

Throughout last year, Adamas One focused on scaling its production capabilities to meet growing demand. By March 2023, the company had achieved full production capacity at its South Carolina facility, boasting 12 reactors producing approximately 3,000 rough carats of diamonds monthly. This achievement positioned Adamas One Corp. as a leading player in the lab-grown diamond market, poised to generate over $12 million in annual revenue from its Greenville operations.

November 2023 marked a significant milestone for JEWL with the successful creation of colorless lab-grown diamonds in the D, E, and F color ranges. This breakthrough, resulting from extensive internal R&D efforts, underscored the company's commitment to quality and innovation. CEO Jay Grdina's strategic roadmap highlighted the strategic importance of this development, particularly in meeting the stringent demands of the jewelry and technology sectors.

A transformative moment for JEWL occurred in November 2023 with the establishment of Adamas Technologies, a wholly-owned subsidiary dedicated to harnessing lab-grown diamond solutions for the technology industry. Led by seasoned industry professionals, including COO Jerry McGuire, Adamas Technologies positioned itself at the forefront of semiconductor innovation. The subsidiary's focus on research, partnerships, and deployment underscored Adamas One Corp.'s commitment to diversification and market expansion.

Setting the Stage for Growth

Just last month, JEWL reaffirmed its strategic initiatives and market penetration efforts through a comprehensive shareholder update. The company's multifaceted approach encompassed delivering high-quality lab-grown diamond materials, launching the Elle Jolie luxury jewelry line, and leveraging its IP and R&D capabilities to explore new sectors, notably the technology industry. CEO Jay Grdina's forward-looking vision emphasized the company's commitment to sustainable growth and value creation for shareholders.

More recently, March 2024 brought accolades for Adamas One Corp. as it received the prestigious title of "Best Lab-Grown Manufacturer for 2023" from Manufacturing Technology Insights Magazine. This recognition underscored the company's unwavering dedication to innovation and excellence in lab-grown diamond manufacturing, reinforcing its position as an industry leader.

Charting the Future

In a strategic move to accelerate innovation, Adamas One Corp. (NASDAQ: JEWL) today announced the formation of a Board of Advisors for its subsidiary, Adamas One Technologies. Comprising esteemed industry experts, the board will provide invaluable guidance as Adamas One Technologies explores novel applications for lab-grown diamonds in the semiconductor industry. This initiative reflects the company's commitment to fostering collaboration and driving technological advancements.

â€œWe are honored to have such distinguished industry experts join the Board of Advisors for Adamas One Technologies," stated Jerry McGuire, COO of Adamas One Corp and newly appointed board member. "Their collective wealth of experience and expertise will undoubtedly propel Adamas One Technologies to new heights as we explore the vast potential of lab-grown diamonds in semiconductor applications. I am excited to collaborate with this esteemed group as we drive innovation and shape the future of technology."
