# PathAI Unveils New Features on AISight Image Management System: Introducing Guided Algorithm Review and Z-Stack Image Support

PathAI, a global leader in AI-powered digital pathology, today announced the launch of two new features on its AISight®1 Image Management System (IMS): Guided Algorithm Review and Z-Stack Image Support. These enhancements reflect PathAI’s ongoing commitment to empowering pathologists with innovative tools that enhance pathology interpretation, optimize laboratory operations, and lay the foundation for broader adoption of AI tools in the field of pathology.

The Guided Algorithm Review feature is designed to help pathologists streamline and enhance case evaluations by highlighting potential Fields of Interest (FOIs) identified by algorithms. TumorDetect2, PathAI’s AI product, will be the first to incorporate this functionality, highlighting key areas of interest. By automatically pinpointing these critical areas, the feature allows pathologists to focus their initial review on the regions that require the most attention.

Key Features of the Guided Algorithm Review:

* Gallery of FOIs: A visual gallery of algorithm-detected fields of interest provides an intuitive way for pathologists to navigate to key tissue areas requiring further analysis.
* Click-Through Review: Enables systematic, step-by-step navigation through regions highlighted by the AI’s predictions, such as areas with high tumor concentration or biomarker quantification, potentially streamlining the review process and enhancing thoroughness.
* Enhanced Interpretability: Overlays and side-by-side comparisons improve the clarity of AI predictions, allowing pathologists to better interpret and verify the results.
* Third-Party AI Integration: Allows for seamless integration with third-party AI algorithms, enabling pathologists to work with various AI solutions in a unified platform, enhancing flexibility and adaptability across different AI tools and workflows.

In addition to the Guided Algorithm Review, PathAI’s Z-Stack Image Support introduces a multi-layer imaging capability that enables pathologists to examine all layers of a multi-layered Whole Slide Image (WSI), producing a 3D-like representation of slides. This feature is particularly beneficial in cytology, where three-dimensional cell clusters often require a more nuanced, layered analysis.

Key Benefits of the Z-Stack Image Support:

* Multi-Layer Viewing: Pathologists can view all layers of a multi-layered Whole Slide Image (WSI), providing an experience similar to a microscope fine focus, particularly useful for cytology cases.
* Efficient Navigation: Features such as Focus Control and keyboard shortcuts allow for smooth transitions between image layers.
* Customizable Workflow: Pathologists can personalize their review process with adjustable zoom, pan, and annotation features, and track their progress through visual indicators.

PathAI has also upgraded its ArtifactDetect3 algorithm, broadening its support for additional file types, such as .mrxs format files and stains, including Masson’s Trichrome and other special stains. These improvements allow laboratories to apply quality control measures across a wider range of specimens and staining protocols, further optimizing laboratory efficiency.

Additional AISight Enhancements:

* Refreshed User Interface: Includes categorized tables for clearer quantitative results, such as tissue areas and cell counts, facilitating easier interpretation.
* Custom Slide Panning: Enhanced control features like Snap to Zoom and adjustable animation durations for more precise slide navigation.
* Automatic Specimen Orientation: Automatically rotates skin specimens based on metadata, ensuring consistency and accuracy in evaluations.

“We are thrilled to introduce these new capabilities to the AISight IMS platform,” said Eric Walk, M.D., FCAP, chief medical officer at PathAI. “The Guided Algorithm Review and Z-Stack Image Support are significant advancements that help pathologists conduct high-quality assessments with efficiency and precision. These tools help enhance and streamline case management supporting the needs of modern pathology labs.”
