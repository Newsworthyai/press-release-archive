# Canter Power Systems Continues Its National Expansion with Acquisition of Grasten Power Technologies

Canter Power Systems (“Canter”), a Generac Power Pro Premier dealer, and one of the largest independent installers and service providers of residential backup power generators in the U.S., is pleased to announce the acquisition of Grasten Power Technologies (“Grasten”), a premier installer and service provider of home standby generators throughout Houston and the broader Texas market. This marks Canter’s third add-on acquisition since partnering with Rotunda Capital Partners in September 2022.

Based in Houston, Texas, Grasten is recognized for its comprehensive generator installation, inspection, maintenance, and repair services, establishing itself as the trusted partner for thousands of homeowners. Known for its exceptional customer service, quality, and responsiveness, Grasten has steadily expanded its geographic reach and maintains thousands of annual service and maintenance contracts.

Partnering with Grasten enhances Canter’s ability to meet the growing demand for reliable backup power solutions across the Texas market, particularly in light of growing grid instability and frequency of severe weather events and related power outages.

“We are excited to welcome Grasten to the Canter family,” said Brian Lopatka, CEO of Canter Power Systems. “This partnership marks an important step in expanding our reach into a critical geographic market. Grasten’s excellent reputation and highly knowledgeable employee base, combined with Canter’s national scale and resources, will allow us to deliver even greater value and reliability to our collective customers throughout Texas and surrounding markets.”

Josh Keller, President and owner of Grasten, expressed excitement about the partnership, stating “Partnering with Canter allows us to continue providing exceptional service, while also benefiting from the resources and infrastructure of a larger organization. We look forward to working with the Canter team to grow our business into new markets, while upholding our commitment to providing top-tier customer service and support.”

“The acquisition of Grasten represents another important milestone as Canter continues to grow its leadership position in the home standby power market,” added Ryan Aprill, Managing Director at Rotunda. “Rotunda looks forward to continuing its support of Canter’s acquisition strategy as the company looks to pursue additional M&A in both new and existing markets.”
