“We are empowering crypto users with better options for exiting their crypto positions when they are ready to do so,” said Robin O’Connell, CEO of Uphold Enterprise. “Many competitors may offer limited off-ramp choices, such as lack of support for assets outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum, or inability to sell from certain jurisdictions, leaving users stuck. We are providing flexibility and control, allowing customers to convert and move their money effortlessly.”

As consumer cryptocurrency adoption increases, more users require options to sell their crypto, Topper is committed to facilitating seamless transitions between digital currencies and fiat, reinforcing the fluidity of modern financial interactions. To meet the ever evolving demands of modern financial transactions, Topper’s off-ramping offers:

* Instant Transactions and Lower Fees: Experience rapid transaction speeds and a competitive fee structure, significantly lower than competitors which typically charge over 4%.
* Unmatched Asset Variety: Access a diverse range of 232 supported assets—up to five times more than any other off-ramp in the market—ensuring users have more options for their transactions.
* Global Accessibility: Enjoy seamless global transactions. Users in the U.S., U.K., and Europe have the added flexibility of choosing between Mastercard or Visa, while users in other countries can off-ramp to a Visa debit card with Visa Original Credit Transactions (OCT).

“Topper now supports the full cycle, not just accepting digital payments, but also enabling smooth and flexible off-ramps so users can exit the digital economy when they choose,” said Frankie Picciano, Global Head of Sales for Topper. “The future of money is fluid, and businesses that can offer users both entry and exit points will thrive in this evolving financial landscape."

Topper’s off-ramp feature is currently accessible at their website www.topperpay.com. Look for Topper’s partners to enable the off-ramp later this year in early the following. Additionally in 2025, Topper plans to continue to add more assets to the platform and expand local payment methods in regions where credit card access is restricted or has low approval ratings.
