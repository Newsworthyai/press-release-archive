Memecoin and DeFi ecosystem Cutoshi is going from strength to strength as it sells out of its third stage of presale. After trending on X, it has become the topic of every conversation.

It’s That Time of Year Again - Altcoin Season!Prominent trader Ali Martinez sees a potential pullback to $90k for Bitcoin, a move that suggests altcoin season is here.

Another sign is that Bitcoin dominance has dropped to 51%, signaling a shift in market sentiment. The Altcoin Season Index, now sitting at 75, confirms that altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin, as 38 of the top 50 cryptocurrencies have beaten BTC over the last 90 days.

It’s the highest level since January, a time when altcoins thrived until March. Analysts are already speculating that this could push many altcoins, particularly those with strong narratives and utility, much higher over the next few months.

A drop in BTC dominance doesn’t just favor the larger altcoins like Ethereum and XRP; it creates opportunities for smaller projects like Cutoshi, which combines the speculative appeal of memecoins with the functionality of DeFi.

CryptoQuant’s Ki Young Ju says that this isn’t just about rotation from Bitcoin to alts. Stablecoin and fiat inflows are increasing trading volume for altcoins, suggesting new money is entering the market.

Meanwhile, an analyst at Rekt Capital argues that Ethereum and smaller alts are seeing capital flows thanks to Bitcoin’s range-bound price action.

Either way, for young projects like Cutoshi, these are prime conditions for growth.

Why Whales Are Turning To Altcoins Whales are increasingly looking beyond Bitcoin for higher returns. With BTC consolidating near its recent highs, larger investors are derisking by diversifying into projects that offer strong upside potential.

For Cutoshi, this is a critical moment. The project is gaining attention not just from retail but also from whales seeking early-stage opportunities.

Its recent presale successes suggest significant interest from both groups.

What Makes Cutoshi Stand Out?Cutoshi has managed to do what few projects can: balance meme culture with real utility. Its Lucky Cat figurine and mascot grab attention, but what’s under the hood is what’s keeping both retail and whales interested. The low-fee, cross-chain DEX is built for everyone, it’s simple, affordable and designed to cut out the barriers that have stopped retail from fully engaging with decentralized finance.

For newbies, it’s the first step into a complicated world that suddenly feels a lot easier and more fun to trade in. The Cutoshi Academy strips DeFi down to the basics, teaching staking, farming and security without overwhelming users. It’s the kind of resource retail investors need to feel confident in their decisions. The whales know that this could facilitate the mainstream adoption of DeFi.

Looking ahead, Cutoshi is rolling out Lucky Cat NFTs with real utilities, like staking rewards and exclusive access to farming pools. A merchandise shop is also planned, rewarding $CUTO holders with discounts.

All of this feeds into a carefully designed tokenomics system where a portion of every transaction on the DEX is burned, creating a deflationary model that could support long-term growth. Cutoshi has also put aside 7% of its total token supply specifically for burning purposes, further supporting its deflationary strategy.

Cutoshi’s Big MilestonesIn the last month, $CUTO is up by over 100% as it sold out of the first three stages in record time. This comes as the project trends in the top spot of X globally, alongside keywords such as DeFi and BTC.

The farming platform has also been released, giving early community members a way to have fun, spread the word and collect tokens, with over 3000 people taking part. Meme competitions are also getting the community active, including a graffiti-style tribute to the Lucky Cat crypto.

Cutoshi’s presale has raised over $1.2M and the price of CUTO may rise again soon if the whales keep buying and given that altcoin season is firmly here, both retail and whales alike are expected to keep piling in.
