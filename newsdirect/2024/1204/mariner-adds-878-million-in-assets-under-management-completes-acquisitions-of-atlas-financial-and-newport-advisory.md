With over 25 years of experience, Atlas Financial excels in asset management, business continuity and wealth transfer strategies. Known for its "Serve First" philosophy, the firm emphasizes building long-term client relationships while offering tailored services such as retirement, estate, education, and business succession planning. Serving business owners and retirees, both current and future, the Atlas team focuses on addressing its clients' most critical priorities, relationships and goals.

"At Atlas Financial, we’re dedicated to helping our clients navigate their unique journeys—whether they’re focused on building wealth, preserving it, or simply enjoying the fruits of their labor,” said Orion Marx, founder of Atlas Financial. “Joining forces with Mariner unlocks a wealth of resources, expertise, and services that will enhance our ability to support our clients and their businesses every step of the way. Ensuring their success remains our top priority, and I’m thrilled to embark on this next chapter as part of the Mariner family.”

Founded in 1995 by Jim Regitz, Newport Advisory takes a holistic approach to financial planning, incorporating every aspect of a client’s financial life to create strategies that align with their goals and values. From retirement and education planning to tax strategies and liability management, Newport and its 12-person team offer comprehensive, tailored guidance, addressing clients’ needs today while building a foundation for tomorrow.

“Joining Mariner marks a transformative new chapter for Newport Advisory,” said Founder Jim Regitz. “This partnership not only strengthens our ability to serve our clients but also opens the door to unparalleled resources and expertise that will elevate the level of care and solutions we deliver. While we embrace this exciting evolution, our commitment to a holistic, client-centric philosophy remains steadfast, ensuring that every decision we make continues to prioritize the unique needs and aspirations of those we are privileged to serve."

Dalphia Partners served as the exclusive financial advisor to Atlas Financial in this transaction. Following the December 2 closing, both firms adopted the Mariner name and continue to operate with their existing teams in place.
