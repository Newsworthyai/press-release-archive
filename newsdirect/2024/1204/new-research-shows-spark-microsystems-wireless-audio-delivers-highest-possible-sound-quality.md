# New Research Shows SPARK Microsystems Wireless Audio Delivers Highest Possible Sound Quality

SPARK Microsystems, a Canadian fabless semiconductor company specializing in next-generation short-range wireless communications, has released the findings of a new third-party expert research analysis demonstrating the bit-perfect wireless audio delivery achievable with SPARK’s ultra-wideband (UWB) technology.

The research findings were initially presented at AES Show 2024 NY and are now available here in a video overview featuring SPARK Microsystems CTO Frederic Nabki and audio expert Jeff Anderson. The research results demonstrate that SPARK UWB audio delivery is indistinguishable from a wired transmission, exhibiting bit-perfect signal fidelity. This performance profile, complemented with low latency of under 7 milliseconds, enables uncorrupted, pristine wireless audio. The sound quality produced is vastly superior to legacy Bluetooth technology, distinguishing SPARK UWB as the wireless platform of choice for prestigious audio brands including Sonus Faber and Focal.

Notably, the SPARK UWB wireless connection also offered bi-directional audio transport, supporting an additional bit-perfect, low-latency uncompressed audio back channel. Although this feature was not a primary focus of the study, it highlights the versatility and advanced capabilities of the technology.

The testing was performed by Jeff Anderson, an independent audio engineering consultant with 25 years of industry expertise. Leveraging wired equipment as the reference, Anderson provides an in-depth comparison of SPARK’s UWB technology to competing audio codecs including LDAC, aptX HD, aptX LL, and SBC. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) measurements were used to evaluate the signal quality of the tested audio systems.

Among the findings, Anderson observed that LDAC, aptX, and aptX HD codecs displayed elevated noise floors and noticeable distortion, especially at higher frequencies. Bluetooth codecs LDAC and aptX HD exhibited latency ranging from 30 to 200 milliseconds, degrading audio quality and introducing noticeable delay. In contrast, SPARK’s UWB delivers a clean, distortion-free signal, demonstrating superior fidelity and comparable performance to the wired reference.

“Wireless solutions based on SPARK UWB technology represent a major step forward, offering unparalleled stability and performance even in increasingly interference-prone environments,” said Rejean Bedel, Groupe Marketing Manager, Focal. “This advancement marks a turning point for high-end audio, enabling seamless, user-friendly, and wire-free products without compromising sound quality.”

“For decades, the industry has accepted compromises in sound quality, latency, and energy efficiency to make wireless audio possible. SPARK's low-power UWB technology changes that, delivering bit-perfect audio exactly as it was encoded at the source, with ultra-low latency that rivals wired connections,” said Frederic Nabki, Co-founder and CTO, SPARK Microsystems. “This breakthrough doesn’t just eliminate wires; it redefines what wireless audio can achieve, setting a new benchmark for fidelity and responsiveness—with low power consumption optimized for battery-powered devices.”
