# Soaring Ahead: ZenaTech (Nasdaq: ZENA) Makes Moves in the Booming Drone Market

The global commercial drone market is on the rise, estimated at USD 19.89 billion in 2022 and projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.9% from 2023 to 2030. This surge is fueled by the increasing enterprise applications of drones across diverse industries and continuous technological advancements. As businesses strive to enhance operational efficiencies and reduce costs, innovative drone solutions are becoming indispensable.

Amid this growth, ZenaTech (Nasdaq: ZENA) is positioning itself as a notable contender, leveraging its AI-driven drone technology to cater to the evolving needs of sectors like agriculture, defense, and logistics.

ZenaTech: A Rising Player in AI Drone TechnologyZenaTech is quickly emerging as a notable contender in the AI and drone technology sector, making strides in both drone manufacturing and enterprise SaaS solutions. Founded in 2017, the company has grown its software development expertise and expanded into cutting-edge drone technologies, positioning itself as a promising stock for investors interested in innovative solutions driving operational efficiency across various industries.

With a focus on enterprise applications in law enforcement, government, industrial sectors, and beyond, ZenaTech’s diverse product lineup and recent regulatory milestones are pushing the company to the forefront of the drone services industry.

ZenaDrone 1000: Enhancing Efficiency in Critical OperationsAt the heart of ZenaTech’s drone division is ZenaDrone, a wholly-owned subsidiary. ZenaDrone’s flagship product, the ZenaDrone 1000, is an intelligent unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) designed to tackle a variety of industrial tasks, from military surveillance and agricultural monitoring to humanitarian missions. The ZenaDrone 1000 offers cutting-edge capabilities such as autonomous flight, heavy-lift capabilities, and long-range operation, making it suitable for mission-critical tasks where reliability and precision are paramount.

The ZenaDrone 1000 incorporates advanced machine learning and AI, allowing it to automate tasks like plant tracking, crop management, and land surveys. Its heavy-duty construction, featuring carbon fiber layering, 360-degree Lidar, and a 4K stabilized camera, positions it as a top choice for industries like construction, defense, and environmental inspection. With 90-degree tilting rotors and quick-swap batteries, it offers flexibility and ease of use in dynamic environments. According to Dr. Shaun Passley, Ph.D., CEO of ZenaTech, “The ZenaDrone 1000 empowers businesses and organizations with precise and efficient mission execution, offering new horizons in unmanned aerial vehicle applications.”

Recent Product Launch: The IQ NanoMost recently, on October 10, 2024, ZenaTech announced the launch of the IQ Nano, a compact indoor drone designed for warehouse inspections and inventory management. The IQ Nano is small but powerful, offering features like autonomous data collection, obstacle avoidance, and a charging pad for convenient use. Weighing just 1.5 kg, the IQ Nano is ideal for indoor applications where space is tight, and drones need to navigate safely around obstacles.

“The IQ Nano is breakthrough technology,” said Dr. Passley. “Its ability to automate inspection, maintenance, and inventory monitoring tasks provides immense value to companies in sectors like warehousing and logistics.”

FAA Approval: A Critical MilestoneOne of ZenaTech’s most significant achievements came on October 2, 2024, when the company announced that it had received approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to begin live testing and demonstrations of the ZenaDrone 1000 in the United States. This FAA exemption for visual line-of-sight commercial applications is a game changer for ZenaTech, as it enables the company to test its drone solutions with U.S.-based partners in real-world scenarios.

“This milestone is central to our work with U.S.-based customers and partners as we refine our drone solutions and expand distribution in the U.S.,” said Dr. Passley. This regulatory approval not only validates the technology but also positions ZenaTech for broader adoption across agriculture, defense, logistics, and search and rescue sectors in the U.S.

ZenaDrone’s recent joint venture with Night Sun, a Native American Corporation, highlights its strategic push into the U.S. market. The venture aims to develop drone applications for search and rescue, firefighting, cargo delivery, and land surveying, specifically for use by Native American tribes across the country. The FAA approval allows ZenaDrone to move forward with these initiatives, expanding its footprint in mission-critical drone services.

Launching Commercial Drone Services in the U.S.Building on the momentum from its FAA approval, ZenaDrone has initiated Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS) operations through its Phoenix, Arizona, office as of October 8, 2024. This marks a significant step for the company, as it begins generating revenue from commercial drone services, offering solutions in land surveying, inspection, monitoring, and tracking. The company is also working towards receiving an aerial spraying license (14 CFR Part 137), which will enable it to offer agricultural services like plant nourishment and pest control.

“We are excited to commence commercial operations in the U.S., which will allow us to expand our reach and revenue streams,” said Dr. Passley. “We believe this is just the beginning as we pave the way for additional regulatory approvals in other countries.”

A Stock to WatchWith significant technological advancements and growing commercial opportunities, ZenaTech is emerging as a strong player in the AI and drone sectors. Its FAA approval, joint ventures, and commercial operations in the U.S. create a compelling growth narrative for potential investors. As the company continues to expand its product lineup and regulatory approvals, it stands to benefit from the increasing demand for AI-driven drone solutions across multiple industries.

For those seeking an up-and-coming company in the drone technology space, ZenaTech (Nasdaq: ZENA) is one to watch.
