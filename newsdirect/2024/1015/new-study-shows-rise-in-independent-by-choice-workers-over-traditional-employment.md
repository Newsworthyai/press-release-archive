# New Study Shows Rise in Independent by Choice Workers over Traditional Employment

A new study from MBO Partners highlights a transformative shift in the American labor market, revealing a 6.5% increase in full-time independent workers, now reaching 27.7 million, since last year. Nearly one in five independent workers now earn more than $100,000 annually, reflecting the expanding economic opportunities offering Americans options from traditional employment toward the freedom and flexibility of self-employment.

“This 6.5% growth in full-time independents signals a clear rejection of the traditional employer-employee social contract,” said Miles Everson, CEO of MBO Partners. “The concept of stable benefits, job security, and mutual loyalty is unraveling. Our study found that 65% of full-time independent workers feel more secure in their careers, and their confidence is reflected in their decision to pursue autonomy and forge their own paths.”

MBO’s State of Independence report, The Independent by Choice Movement: Authentic and Intentional, now in its 14th year, shows that 72.7 million Americans are choosing independent work in 2024. Millennials and Gen Z are at the forefront of this movement, with their combined share of the independent workforce rising from 52% in 2023 to 59% in 2024. As traditional employment loses its appeal, these younger generations are redefining career success, prioritizing flexibility, purpose, and financial independence over conventional job structures.

Additional insights from the 2024 study include:

Traditional Employment is on Shaky Ground

The study reveals that 34% of traditional jobholders fear losing their jobs, while 42% are considering a career change this year. In contrast, 65% of full-time independents feel more secure, and nearly 60% say their work aligns with their identity, compared to just 47% of traditional workers. As the employer-employee social contract frays, traditional jobholders question employer commitment to retaining talent. Many workers are switching jobs more frequently or transitioning to independent work, with job tenure steadily declining.

Independent by Choice Drives a Bold New Era of Self-Directed Careers

In 2024, 61% of independent workers chose this path by choice, not necessity, with only 10% saying they felt forced into it. Confidence in independent work is growing, with 65% of full-time independents feeling more secure than in traditional jobs, and 54% saying they wouldn’t return to payroll employment. Independent work is now seen as a viable career strategy, with 4.7 million independents earning over $100,000 annually, up from 3 million in 2020. This shift represents a growing movement toward autonomy and purpose, not just a fallback option.

AI and Global Reach Fuel Independent Growth

In 2024, the number of full-time and part-time independent professionals providing services to businesses surged by 14%, reaching 11.2 million. These independents are climbing the value chain, leveraging specialized skills and generative AI—65% now use AI tools, up sharply from 37% in 2023. AI has become a game changer, enhancing productivity and competitiveness, leading to a rise in six-figure earners. Additionally, thanks to platforms, marketplaces, and social media, the global reach of independent workers is expanding. In 2024, 31% reported providing services to customers outside the U.S., nearly triple the proportion from 2012.

“More people are turning to independent work,” Everson added. “This is not just a trend - it’s an inspiring shift, with a workforce determined to redefine success on its own terms.”
