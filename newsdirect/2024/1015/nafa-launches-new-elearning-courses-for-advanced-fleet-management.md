# NAFA Launches New eLearning Courses for Advanced Fleet Management

NAFA Fleet Management Association (NAFA), the vehicle fleet industry’s largest membership association, is excited to announce the launch of the first two courses in its new eLearning series. These self-paced, virtual courses are designed to provide fleet professionals with a comprehensive understanding of core fleet competencies and best practices across a wide range of fleet management areas.

By the end of 2024, a total of nine eLearning courses will be available, covering key topics across the industry. The first two courses—Asset Management and Sustainable Fleet—are live now, with additional courses to be released over the coming months.

"The launch of NAFA’s eLearning Courses represents a significant step in providing flexible, accessible education for fleet professionals," said Bill Schankel, CAE, CEO of NAFA. "These courses allow fleet managers to gain critical skills and knowledge at their convenience, empowering them to implement best practices and drive their organizations forward."

With the fleet industry advancing rapidly, NAFA’s eLearning platform offers interactive, up-to-date training that reflects the latest industry trends, technologies and practices. Fleet professionals across all sectors can access specialized learning modules, with the flexibility to complete the training at their own pace. Courses include interactive exercises, quizzes, checkpoints, and explainer animations to enhance the learning experience, with ongoing access to course materials for continuous review.

First eLearning Courses Released:
