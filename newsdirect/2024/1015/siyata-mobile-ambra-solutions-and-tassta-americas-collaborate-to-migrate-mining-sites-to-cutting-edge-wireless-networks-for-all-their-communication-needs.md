For years mining companies had no choice but to build two communications networks, one for data and the other for two-way radio. After all, in remote locations, both are important to keep mining operations going.

But thanks to LTE/5G networks, the old way of doing things – which was costly and cumbersome – is going away. That’s particularly true of new greenfield mines, which are increasingly installing one LTE/5G network to meet all their needs. Even existing mines, recognizing the benefits, which include better coverage and connectivity, are melding their networks into one. They are turning to companies like Siyata Mobile Inc. (NASDAQ: SYTA), Ambra Solutions and TASSTA Americas to make it happen.

The three are collaborating to help mining sites migrate from a traditional VHF/UHF two-way radio system into what the companies say are cutting-edge wireless networks enabling voice, data and real-time location services. All three play an important role in making this a reality, bringing many benefits to their mining customers.

Communicating Everywhere Take automatic channel switching for starters. In dynamic industrial environments maintaining consistent and reliable communications is essential for operational safety and efficiency. TASSTA Americas` software solution enables automatic channel switching, ensuring workers remain connected to the correct network segment as they move throughout the site. This functionality helps prevent communication failures and ensures continuous connectivity across the entire industrial site, enhancing both safety and operational efficiency.

Then there are vehicle-mounted push-to-talk (PTT) devices. For industries requiring robust and reliable communication solutions, Siyata offers specialized vehicle-mounted PTT devices designed to withstand the harshest conditions. These devices provide workers with effective communication tools, ensuring reliable, hands-free communication even within vehicles operating in challenging conditions.

Safety Front And Center Safety is also top of mind for mining operators and an LTE/5G network system facilitates that and then some, from man-down detection to emergency video functionality. After all, worker safety remains a top priority in any work environment, especially in ones where workers can encounter a number of hazardous elements. TASSTA Americas' advanced software solutions, integrated with Ambra’s private LTE/5G connectivity solutions, include man-down detection systems that utilize sensors to monitor worker status. These systems automatically alert emergency services in the event of a fall or incapacitation, ensuring rapid responses and possibly avoiding critical situations.

In the event of an emergency, the availability of real-time visual information can be critical. Ambra’s LTE/5G solutions, coupled with TASSTA Americas' emergency response software, enable the automatic activation of video functionality on devices when the SOS button is pressed. This integration provides emergency responders with immediate visual context to better assess and address the situation.

Communicating Without Interferences But the benefits don’t end there. Electromagnetic interference mitigation is another important feature for miners and their workers. In facilities like aluminum smelters, severe electromagnetic interference can pose significant challenges, potentially disrupting the operation of electronic devices and creating safety hazards. Ambra Solutions' Private LTE/5G networks are engineered to function reliably in these environments, maintaining operational integrity even in the presence of strong electromagnetic fields. Siyata says that this capability ensures uninterrupted communication and device functionality, even under the most challenging conditions, with Siyata's rugged devices specifically designed to withstand such adverse conditions.

The ability to communicate one-on-one and in groups is also important, which is where flexible talk-groups come in. In dynamic industrial operations, the ability to create and manage multiple talk groups without the need for reconfiguring devices is crucial. TASSTA Americas offers this flexibility, allowing for scalable communication setups that can easily adapt to evolving operational needs. TASSTA Americas software enables the creation of as many talk groups as needed without requiring extensive device reconfiguration or downtime.

Recording communications is essential for developing effective emergency response strategies and analyzing incidents post-occurrence. TASSTA Americas' software supports the recording of all communications, providing valuable data that can be used to refine safety protocols and prevent future emergencies.

Looking to the future, the Ambra LTE/5G network can also support things like automated guided vehicles or AGVs. Industries like aluminum smelters, where operational conditions are particularly harsh, increasingly rely on AGVs to enhance efficiency and reduce human exposure to dangerous environments. Ambra Solutions’ Private LTE/5G networks provide the robust and reliable communication infrastructure needed for AGVs to operate seamlessly in such challenging environments.

While Siyata and TASSTA Americas focus on human communication solutions, Ambra Solutions ensures that the AGVs are fully supported by a network that guarantees high-speed, uninterrupted connectivity, allowing these vehicles to perform autonomously and safely.

The integration of Ambra Solutions' Private LTE/5G networks in industrial environments, combined with Siyata's rugged communication devices and TASSTA Americas' advanced software solutions, marks what the companies say is a leap forward in both operational efficiency and safety. These technologies address the unique challenges faced by modern industrial settings, ensuring that industries can operate more safely and efficiently.

As industries continue to evolve, the adoption of Ambra’s LTE/5G connectivity, along with Siyata's and TASSTA Americas' products, expect to play a crucial role in creating smarter and safer working environments, and so, even across time and evolving technologies. Ambra is focused on providing their clients a future-proof infrastructure that will be capable of adapting with existing technologies while enabling future use-cases without having to replace hardware or start all over again, which means that networks deployed today are also an investment in tomorrow.
