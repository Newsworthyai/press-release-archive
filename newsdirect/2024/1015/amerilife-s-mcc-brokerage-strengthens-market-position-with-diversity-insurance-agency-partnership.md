# AmeriLife's MCC Brokerage Strengthens Market Position with Diversity Insurance Agency Partnership

MCC Brokerage, an innovative field marketing organization in the life and health insurance industry and affiliate partner of AmeriLife Group, LLC, today announced that it has partnered with Diversity Insurance Agency, a Medicare Advantage brokerage company with more than 900 contracted agents licensed in nearly all 50 U.S. states. Per the agreement, terms of the deal were not disclosed.

“We are excited to welcome Tim Barlow and his team to our growing Health Distribution network,” said Darren Houck, President of MCC Brokerage. “Diversity Insurance has set itself apart from other agencies through its hands-on approach to training, lead programs, and expert support staff, and we are confident in its continued success.”

By meeting people where they are, investing in them, and nurturing their growth, Diversity Insurance Agency provides its agents with the tools and training needed to succeed. Powered by a grassroots approach, a mature outreach program of specialized community events, and a traditional door-to-door educational initiative, licensed agents guide their clients through coverage that meets their personal health and financial needs.

“Securing the proper Medicare coverage can be a complex, overwhelming task for many beneficiaries,” said Tim Barlow, President of Diversity Insurance Agency. “Our personalized approach and training protocols ensure that agents are well-versed in plan offerings available in each community we serve and are trained to help consumers balance the costs and benefits to meet their needs. We are thrilled to continue this level of service with the MCC Brokerage team and AmeriLife’s distribution and partnership platform.”

With MCC Brokerage and AmeriLife, DIA will enjoy expanded access to tools and resources to boost its reach, productivity, and profitability.

"Tim and his team have taken traditional, person-to-person relationship-building to the next level," said Scotty Elliott, Chief Distribution Officer of Health for AmeriLife. "This approach is vital to building trust with our customers, validates the importance of health insurance agents' role in the insurance process, and reflects an important segment of AmeriLife’s core, value-based belief in how we conduct our business."
