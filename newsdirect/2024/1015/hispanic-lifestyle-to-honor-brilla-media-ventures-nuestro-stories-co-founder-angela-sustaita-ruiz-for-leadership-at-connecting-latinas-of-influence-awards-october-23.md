Hispanic Lifestyle announced that Brilla Media Ventures Co-Founder and Chairwoman Angela Sustaita-Ruiz will be recognized for her national leadership in the Latino community during Hispanic Lifestyle’s Connecting Latinas of Influence event, October 23 in Ft. Lauderdale.

With 25 years in digital media, marketing and public relations, Angela has led award-winning U.S. Hispanic and multicultural programs. Prior to Brilla Media, she co-founded Hispanicize Media Group in 2009 and the first Latino influencer network, Latina Mom Bloggers (later renamed DiMe Media). She has led hundreds of influencer and community engagement marketing campaigns for major brands including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), The Ad Council, Disney, Unilever, P&G, Netflix, HBO, among many others. In 2019, she sold the majority of Hispanicize to John Leguizamo’s NGL Collective, and in 2022, Leguizamo and Angela were part of the collective that sold all of NGL to Go Digital/ MiTu.

Angela’s most recent accolades include being named the 2023 Hispanic Heritage Entrepreneur of the Year Award by Latin American Business Association, a semi-finalist for Pharrell Williams’ Black Ambition Prize, and winning the 2021 Hermes Creative Award for the CDC’s “How Right Now” COVID Mental Health Response Campaign. In 2021, Angela was a finalist for the PRWeek Multicultural Marketing Campaign of the Year for Altisimo Live for farmworker relief, and she is also a past recipient of the Hispanic Public Relations Association (HPRA) Professional of the Year Award.
