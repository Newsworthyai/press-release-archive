# Positioned for Growth: Impact BioMedical Inc.'s (NYSEAmerican: IBO) Push into Cancer and Immune Health

The demand for innovative treatments in oncology and advanced healthcare solutions has never been higher. With cancer still a leading cause of death worldwide, breakthroughs in therapeutic technology are essential. As global investment pours into biotech, driven by an aging population and an increased focus on chronic disease management, companies pursuing novel cancer therapies and immune health solutions are positioned to make a significant impact. In this environment, firms with versatile, patent-backed technologies are set to play an influential role in the future of healthcare.

Impact BioMedical Inc. (NYSEAmerican: IBO) has gained momentum with its recent innovations, major partnerships, and expanding intellectual property in healthcare solutions. Focused on biopharmaceuticals and consumer wellness, the company develops proprietary technologies that address unmet needs across oncology, neurology, immunology, and consumer health. With its recent IPO and a seasoned leadership team in place, Impact BioMedical is poised to accelerate its growth and reach in the healthcare market.

Successful IPO and Investor ConfidenceImpact BioMedical’s initial public offering, completed in September 2024, marks a major milestone, providing new resources to push its mission forward. The IPO received strong investor participation, with over 30% of the offering purchased by existing stakeholders—a clear sign of investor confidence in the company’s potential. CEO Frank D. Heuszel noted, “The significant participation of our investors underscores their confidence in our mission and the innovative healthcare solutions we are developing.” This support bolsters Impact BioMedical’s ability to advance its technology platforms and pursue new licensing opportunities.

Linebacker Technology Receives Canadian PatentA significant achievement for Impact BioMedical came with the issuance of a Canadian patent for its Linebacker technology. This patent, titled "Electrophilically Enhanced Phenolic Compounds for Treating Inflammatory Related Diseases and Disorders," covers enhanced phenolic compounds tailored to target inflammatory processes. The Canadian patent highlights Impact BioMedical’s ongoing commitment to tackling inflammatory diseases, a market valued at approximately $7 billion in Canada alone in 2022. Heuszel emphasized the commercial potential of this breakthrough, stating, “This patent issuance strengthens our growing IP portfolio and underscores the innovative nature and commercial and therapeutic potential of our Linebacker technology.”

Linebacker compounds target inflammation by regulating key pathways involved in inflammatory responses, presenting an alternative to traditional anti-inflammatory drugs. With potential applications in treating arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease, Linebacker could make an impact across multiple therapeutic areas. Beyond inflammation, these compounds have shown promise in oncology and neurology, positioning Linebacker as a versatile platform. The Canadian patent protects these innovations until 2037, adding long-term value to Impact BioMedical’s portfolio.

Leadership Team: Vision and Expertise Driving InnovationFollowing its IPO, IBO introduced its executive team, with Frank D. Heuszel leading as CEO. A finance veteran with extensive experience in commercial banking, Heuszel has been instrumental in steering the company through its IPO and positioning it for growth. He is joined by COO Mark Suseck, an experienced leader in healthcare operations, and CFO Todd Macko, a specialist in fiscal management and corporate strategy. Together, the team brings a wealth of expertise to guide Impact BioMedical into its next phase.

Jason Grady, the Director and Interim CEO of DSS Inc., expressed confidence in the leadership, stating, “With their expertise and commitment, we are confident in our ability to advance our mission and deliver impactful healthcare solutions.” This team’s combined experience strengthens the company’s ability to execute its vision for the healthcare market.

Beyond Linebacker: Innovative Platforms in Consumer HealthExpanding its reach beyond biopharmaceuticals, IBOhas developed its 3F technology platform, which recently received a U.S. patent for its insect-repelling composition. The 3F platform uses plant-derived compounds to repel insects by interfering with their olfactory receptors, potentially preventing insect-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever. Unlike conventional products, 3F offers a natural alternative for repelling insects, with applications in sprays, lotions, and shampoos.

Heuszel emphasized the market potential for 3F, commenting, “This is another demonstration of success with our business model delivering new unique proprietary technology with the potential to address unmet needs in human healthcare.” This patent, alongside the existing Linebacker IP, expands Impact BioMedical’s portfolio and opens doors for partnerships in consumer health.

Partnerships and Future DirectionsImpact BioMedical is actively pursuing collaborations to bring its technologies to market, including global partnerships with companies like ProPhase Labs for the commercialization of Linebacker compounds. The Linebacker platform, derived from modified polyphenols such as myricetin, holds potential for multiple therapeutic areas, including oncology, inflammatory disorders, and neurology. Early studies suggest its promise as a co-therapy for cancers, including lung and colon cancer, which are among the leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide.

By focusing on scientific advancements and building partnerships, Impact BioMedical positions itself as a forward-thinking player in healthcare. This approach aims to leverage both its research and market reach, ensuring that its technologies make a meaningful impact.

ConclusionImpact BioMedical Inc.’s (NYSEAmerican: IBO) blend of innovative technologies, strong leadership, and strategic partnerships sets it apart as a versatile player in the healthcare industry. With a successful IPO, a growing patent portfolio, and applications in both therapeutic and consumer health, the company is well-prepared to make significant strides. Through scientific exploration and dedicated collaborations, IBO could be on track to become a transformative force in human healthcare.
