# Duke Robotics Announces Commercial Launch of IC Drone for High-Voltage Insulator Washing Services

Duke Robotics Corp. (OTCQB: DUKR) (formerly known as UAS Drone Corp, OTCQB: USDR) (the “Company” or “Duke Robotics”), a leader in advanced robotics technology and autonomous drone solutions, is pleased to announce the successful completion of the development and official launch of its innovative IC Drone, a first-of-its-kind system for washing high-voltage electric insulators. Following an extensive development phase and successful pilot testing, the IC Drone is now fully operational with the Israel Electric Corporation (IEC) and positioned for deployment with other utility providers worldwide.

The IC Drone’s advanced technology provides utility companies with a safer, more efficient, and environmentally sustainable solution for maintaining high-voltage electric infrastructure than the currently available methods. This state-of-the-art, drone-enabled system replaces traditional methods that rely on large, resource-intensive tanker trucks or helicopters, achieving significant water savings and operational cost reductions per insulator or electric pole.

Key Features and Benefits of the IC Drone:

* Enhanced Safety and Precision: Enables high-voltage insulator cleaning with minimal personnel risk and greater precision compared to traditional methods.
* Environmental Sustainability: Reduces water usage significantly, supporting sustainability initiatives within utility maintenance.
* Cost-Effective Operations: Cuts operational costs by tens of percent per insulator and simplifies access to remote or difficult-to-reach infrastructure.

Yossef Balucka, Chief Executive Officer of Duke Robotics, commented, “The launch of our IC Drone marks an important milestone in our journey to revolutionize utility maintenance. By offering a safer, more efficient, and eco-friendly solution, we believe the IC Drone will create substantial value for utility providers around the world. We look forward to bringing this groundbreaking technology to market and helping companies optimize their operations while prioritizing environmental stewardship.”

This IC Drone launch exemplifies Duke Robotics' commitment to leveraging robotics technology to drive innovation across civilian and utility sectors, complementing its existing solutions for military applications.
