# Curves and Combatboots, LLC ("CNC"), a Veteran-owned and operated Women's Activewear brand, announces a successful recapitalization and growth financing

Curves and Combatboots, LLC ("CNC"), a Veteran-owned and operated Women's Activewear brand, announced a successful recapitalization and growth financing today. CEO Elijah Maine, a 20-year Military Veteran (Navy Chief), announced how pleased he was to partner with Managing Directors Nathan Myerowitz and Ira J. Perlmuter of Curves and CB, LLC, to finance future growth of the company.

Elijah and his wife Sarah, founded CNC several years ago to cater to female Veterans, Police and Emergency First Responders. The company is dedicated to creating unique high quality, high-performance activewear that blends comfort, durability, and style while supporting the journey of women who inspire resilience in their everyday lives.

CNC revolutionized how women could protect themselves by introducing their concealed-carry leggings, so that women can safely exercise, and go about their business knowing that they are able to comfortably and safely protect themselves if needed.

Myerowitz stated, “I'm thrilled at the opportunity to invest in this Veteran-owned business! The potential for growth is immense, and I’m excited to be part of a brand that embodies discipline, resilience, and dedication—values that resonate deeply with consumers today. With the right strategy and support, this brand can expand rapidly, tapping into a market that not only values quality but also wants to support those who have served. I’m eager to help scale this business to new heights and make a lasting impact in the industry!”

Perlmuter expressed that “We are proud and happy to help a Veteran hero recapitalize and grow his company. We look forward to many successful years of growth.”
