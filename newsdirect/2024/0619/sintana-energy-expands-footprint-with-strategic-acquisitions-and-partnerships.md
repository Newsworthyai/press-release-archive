# Sintana Energy Expands Footprint with Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships

Sintana Energy CEO Robert Bose recently spoke with Steve Darling from Proactive to discuss the company's significant developments and strategic plans for the year ahead. Among the key highlights was the completion of Sintana's acquisition of Giraffe Energy, a move that secures a controlling interest in a partnership with Namibia's National Oil Company for a license in the Orange Basin. This acquisition notably extends Sintana's footprint within this highly productive exploration region.

Bose emphasized the successful partnership with Chevron, particularly regarding the Pel 90 license. Additionally, Chevron has teamed up with Sintana on the Pel 82 license in the Walvis Basin, further strengthening their collaboration in Namibia. This expansion underscores ongoing strategic growth and exploration opportunities for both companies in the region.

Recent exploration efforts on Pel 83, operated by Galp of Portugal, have yielded substantial discoveries at the Mopani prospect. Two wells have produced multiple light oil finds, with estimates exceeding 10 billion barrels of oil. Galp is planning a further four-well campaign to explore and appraise the Mopani prospect, set to commence in the fourth quarter of 2024. Concurrently, Chevron is slated to begin exploration activities on Pel 90.

Bose also highlighted Sintana's recent recognition as the top energy company on the 2024 TSX Venture 50 list. This accolade is a testament to Sintana's strategic positioning, strong partnerships, and dedicated team efforts. Such recognition underscores the company's significant achievements and its promising potential within the energy sector.

These developments mark a significant milestone for Sintana Energy, reflecting the company's robust growth strategy and its commitment to leveraging strategic partnerships and acquisitions to enhance its exploration and production capabilities.
