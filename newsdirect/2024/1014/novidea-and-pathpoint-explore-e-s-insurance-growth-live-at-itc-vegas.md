# Novidea and Pathpoint Explore E&S Insurance Growth Live at ITC Vegas

Novidea, creator of the cloud-based, data-driven enterprise insurance management platform for brokers, agents, MGAs/MGUs, carriers, and wholesalers, and Pathpoint, the modern wholesaler where insurance agents can get bindable, small commercial E&S quotes in just a few minutes, will present a live Q&A at ITC Vegas, the world's largest gathering of insurance innovation. Jeff Heine, Chief Revenue Officer of Novidea, and Alexander Bargmann, CEO and Co-founder of Pathpoint, will present "ITC Brokers: Powering E&S Growth through Strategic Tech Investments," on Tuesday, October 15, 2024, at 11:15 a.m. Pacific Time at ITC Las Vegas at Ballroom F of the Mandalay Bay Convention Center.

Pathpoint is one of the fastest-growing Excess & Surplus (E&S) insurance wholesalers in the U.S. Since implementing Novidea's insurance management platform, the company has achieved a 20 percent policy submission growth rate and doubled its sales and underwriting operations to further expand its presence across the country. Novidea's technology enabled the seamless integration of data and applications across Pathpoint's underwriting, account, sales, and operations departments, eliminating data silos and facilitating data-driven decisions about the business. With greater access to customer and operational data across the business, Pathpoint gained greater insights into which lines of business were performing well. They were also able to uncover new opportunities to launch additional risk products in key geographic regions best positioned for growth.

"The strategic technology investments we've made over the last few years and the ecosystem we've built have been instrumental in our growth strategy," Bargmann said. "I'm looking forward to joining Jeff Heine of Novidea on stage at ITC to share the Pathpoint story. I hope to inspire and educate other E&S and intermediary insurance leaders with valuable advice that they can implement in their own organizations."

Experts across the insurance industry predict the E&S segment will outpace the overall commercial lines market within the next few years. E&S saw double-digit, year-over-year growth for four consecutive years. To support this unprecedented growth, E&S brokers and agents must make investments in modern, highly scalable technology so they can keep up with demand and respond faster.

"Novidea research shows that 49% of insurance business decision-makers say enabling growth is the number one priority when choosing a new technology. E&S and the broader intermediary market that lack modern technology systems to help them streamline processes at scale will lose out on the massive growth potential this sector is experiencing," said Jeff Heine, CRO at Novidea. "In our presentation at ITC, Alex and I will talk about the need for agile, cloud-native technologies that deliver a great digital experience while eliminating the need for agents to re-key information or fill out clunky forms. We will show how speed, accuracy, efficiency, and scale are the keys to success for E&S players like Pathpoint."

In addition to the presentation, Novidea is a sponsor and exhibitor at ITC Vegas. For more information about Novidea's award-winning technology, visit ITC booth number #2365 or visit www.novidea.com.
