# VTS Recognized on Commercial Observer’s Annual Power Proptech List For Third Consecutive Year

VTS, the industry's only technology platform that unifies owners, operators, brokers, and their customers across the real estate ecosystem, today announced that Commercial Observer has recognized CEO Nick Romito, Chief Strategy Officer Ryan Masiello, and Chief Technology Officer Swaroopa Penikelapati in its third annual Power Proptech List.

“We’ve seen immense product-led growth in 2024, and our recognition as a power player in proptech is a testament to all of the hard work our team at VTS has invested since day one,” said Nick Romito, CEO of VTS. “We look forward to maintaining our position at the forefront of industry transformation and to continue pushing the boundaries of innovation for real estate.”

Under Romito, Masiello, and Penikelapati’s leadership, VTS has celebrated numerous company milestones in the past year and continued to expand its platform’s capabilities. In March 2024, VTS announced the launch of VTS 4, the company’s novel predictive analytics solution powered by the newly developed VTS Demand Model. Along with the launch of VTS 4, VTS expanded its VTS Data offering to the London market, bringing commercial real estate’s only real-time data and insights to the United Kingdom. In April 2024, the company announced it would be expanding into the multifamily sector with the launch of its resident experience offering, VTS Activate Multifamily, and major residential industry players Lendlease, Habitat, and Stonehenge all selected and deployed it as their resident experience solution of choice. In May 2024, VTS introduced VTS Activate Workplace, the first workplace experience solution that can combine native workplace and building systems into one application.

VTS continues to be a trusted source for industry data, with its quarterly VTS Office Demand Index (VODI) and annual Global Landlord Report. In February 2024, VTS introduced its Global Workplace Report, which leverages data to pinpoint corporate tenant needs and expectations related to office space.

“We’re honored to be recognized once again on Commercial Observer’s Power PropTech list,” said Ryan Masiello, Chief Strategy Officer at VTS. “At VTS, we have always focused on anticipating industry needs and delivering solutions that drive meaningful impact for both landlords and tenants. We remain committed to being a leader in proptech, and are incredibly excited for what the future holds for both VTS and the real estate industry at large.”

"I’m thrilled to be recognized by the Commercial Observer in their annual Power Proptech List alongside Nick and Ryan, as well as other innovators in the proptech space” said Swaroopa Penikelapati, Chief Technology Officer at VTS. “VTS is committed to innovation by driving meaningful outcomes through our technology and solving problems for our customer base. I look forward to continuing to push the boundaries of what our platform can deliver and drive maximum value for our customers.”

Commercial Observer’s annual Power Proptech List is a compilation of the most influential individuals in the rapidly evolving world of proptech. In a field that continues to undergo significant transformation, this list recognizes executives and companies that shape the industry and possess the resilience and innovation necessary to thrive in changing times.
