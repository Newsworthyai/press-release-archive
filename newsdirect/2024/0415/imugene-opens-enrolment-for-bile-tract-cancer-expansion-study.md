# Imugene opens enrolment for Bile Tract Cancer expansion study

--News Direct--

Imugene Ltd (ASX:IMU) CEO Leslie Chong sits down with Proactive’s Jonathan Jackson to discuss enrolment for a pivotal expansion study targeting bile tract cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) patients. This follows the successful completion of the fifth high-dose cohort in the intratumoural arm of the VAXINIA monotherapy dose escalation study, which evaluates the effectiveness of the cancer-killing virus CF33-hNIS (VAXINIA).Chong gives insight into the new phase of the study, particularly given VAXINIA's promising results in gastrointestinal cancers. Notably, the trial has already seen remarkable outcomes, including one patient with cholangiocarcinoma achieving a complete response and another maintaining stable disease.The expansion trial, known as the MAST trial, aims to enrol 10 patients and is part of Imugene’s broader efforts to advance its innovative oncological treatments. Previous phases have demonstrated significant positive responses, especially in gastrointestinal cancers, further underscoring the potential of VAXINIA.Additionally, this week, Imugene will present VAXINIA at the 2024 Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation Annual Conference. The company continues to gather support for its cutting-edge therapies, which have so far shown no safety concerns across various cancer types, including thymic carcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer.
