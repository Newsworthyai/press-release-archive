# NuggMD to Again Offer Cannabis Support Line, the Too-High Hotline, on 4/20

--News Direct--

NuggMD, the nation's leading medical marijuana telemedicine platform, is once again helping accidental cannabis over-indulgers find support this 4/20 with its Too-High Hotline.

The hotline (323-518-2728), first established last April, is a resource for consumers who, for whatever reason—cough, cough—want a friendly voice who will converse with them, calm them down, or just listen.

States have seen an explosion in much-needed harm- and anxiety-reduction measures, thanks to the reduced stigma around cannabis use. Still, many Americans resist seeking help for highly emotional psychedelic experiences because cannabis is still illegal at the federal level. This results in unguided use by consumers who are unprepared to handle unusual mental effects. It is why emergency-room visits for the overconsumption of cannabis usually spike on April 20.

“To be clear: Yes, this is a real service. Anyone who consumes, or consumes too much, this April 20 can call us and talk to us about whatever they want to. No judgments,” said Alex Milligan, co-founder and CMO of NuggMD.

He continued: “There is also a serious side to the 4/20 holiday that I hope gets more attention this year. The cannabis movement acknowledges the need for harm-reduction measures as the substance continues to gain mainstream acceptance. Use of the plant affects different people in different ways, and the truth is that some of those effects are negative or unpleasant. So, beyond setting up the Too-High Hotline every April, we are committed to consumer empowerment and education every day throughout the year.”

NuggMD’s Too-High Hotline is available to everyone in the United States this 4/20 to offer support during or after their cannabis experience. NuggMD is also educating patients about harm reduction and support options through a dedicated landing page, nationwide email notifications to its network of more than a million patients, and additional ongoing campaigns focused on harm reduction and safe consumption.
