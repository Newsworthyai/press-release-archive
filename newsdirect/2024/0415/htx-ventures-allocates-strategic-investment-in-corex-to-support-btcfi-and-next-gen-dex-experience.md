# HTX Ventures Allocates Strategic Investment in COREx to Support BTCFi and Next-Gen DEX Experience

--News Direct--

In a decisive move to enhance the accessibility and impact of Web3 technologies, HTX Ventures, the global investment arm of the cryptocurrency exchange HTX, has made a strategic investment in COREx, the DEX backed by CoreDAO, positioned to be a flagship product in the Core Ecosystem. This advanced DEX platform is set to transform its domain by integrating social networking with AI-powered tools, signaling a new phase in the DeFi space.

* CoreDAO, designed as BTCFi, is an EVM-compatible Layer 1 public blockchain built on the Geth codebase. It enhances throughput and reduces costs through a hard fork. This algorithm integrates Proof of Work (PoW) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) to achieve scalability, security, and autonomy. By leveraging the CoreDAO infrastructure, COREx establishes an efficient marketplace that fully realizes the potential of BTCFi.

COREx offers a dynamic ecosystem supporting trading and community empowerment with innovative tools to improve user experience and enhance decentralized networks for value creation. Features include a intuitive and customizable interface for easy onboarding, advanced transaction options, and comprehensive community engagement tools. COREx is currently in its testnet phase and plans to launch free-mint NFTs as rewards for its community.

Edward, Managing Partner at HTX Ventures, underscored the strategic value of COREx in the evolving Web3 framework: "Our investment reflects our confidence in COREx's ability to fundamentally change how users interact on DEX platforms through social and AI-enhanced features. COREx differentiates itself by offering advanced tools that foster a more connected and effective community, alongside a strong partnership network that will propel both its development and community expansion. This not only extends the appeal of Web3 to new users but also sets a sustainable growth trajectory for DeFi participants."

Daya, Co-founder and CTO of COREx, a crypto veteran with over a decade of experience states: "COREx is set to transform the DeFi sector, beginning with a DEX platform before expanding into a comprehensive suite of tools. This ecosystem will offer substantial value to all stakeholders, providing benefits at every turn. We are adaptable and dynamic, ready to tackle future challenges collaboratively with our partners and community members to establish COREx as the premier destination for all DeFi needs."

Having recently completed a successful seed funding round led by CoreDAO Ecosystem and witnessing substantial interest in its public round, COREx is well-positioned to accelerate its technological developments and redefine the DEX trading experience.
