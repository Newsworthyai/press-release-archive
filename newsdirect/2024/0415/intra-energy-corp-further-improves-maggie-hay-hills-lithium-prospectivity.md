# Intra Energy Corp further improves Maggie Hay Hills lithium prospectivity

--News Direct--

Intra Energy Corporation Ltd (ASX:IEC) managing director Ben Dunn speaks with Proactive’s Jonathan Jackson about the significant progress with lithium exploration efforts at Maggie Hays Hill in the Lake Johnston Greenstone Belt in Western Australia.Following recent rock chip sampling, IEC has received “outstanding” assays of lithium, tantalum, niobium, caesium and tin, confirming the high prospectivity of the site. The results have notably included eye-opening levels of caesium, indicating potential new avenues for exploration success.Dunn said the results not only confirmed compelling lithium targets but also the presence of key pathfinder elements used in identifying such targets.The company has scheduled a first-pass reverse circulation (RC) drilling program for the June quarter to further test these targets. Dunn expressed optimism about the program's potential.Additionally, IEC has lodged a heritage survey request with the Ngadju Native Title Group, ensuring compliance with local regulations and respect for indigenous lands. The proximity of the project to a new lithium processing hub being developed by Mineral Resources on an adjacent property further enhances the strategic value of the Maggie Hays Hill Project.#ProactiveInvestors #IntraEnergyCorp #ASX #Lithium #CriticalMinerals #Niobium #MaggieHaysHill #invest #investing #investment #investor #stockmarket #stocks #stock #stockmarketnews
