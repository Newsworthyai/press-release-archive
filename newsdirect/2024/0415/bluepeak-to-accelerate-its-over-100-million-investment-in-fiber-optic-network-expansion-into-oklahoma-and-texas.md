# Bluepeak to Accelerate Its Over $100 Million Investment in Fiber Optic Network Expansion Into Oklahoma and Texas

--News Direct--

Bluepeak is accelerating its more than $100 million investment to expand its fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) network to over ten new markets in Oklahoma and Texas starting this year.

“We’re thrilled to continue building out our fiber-to-the-home network, expanding into new communities and bringing cutting-edge technology and an incredible value proposition to more customers in Oklahoma, Texas and elsewhere,” said Bluepeak CEO Rich Fish.

The expansion means Bluepeak’s fiber network will soon be available to more than 100,000 new homes and businesses in new markets across Oklahoma and Texas. Denison, Texas, was the company’s most recent fiber expansion market announced in late 2023, and the new investment by Bluepeak will result in more than ten additional communities in the region benefiting from greater choice among their internet options starting in 2024 and 2025.

Since 2021, Bluepeak has been dramatically improving broadband options by bringing fast, reliable, affordable fiber internet to residents of Oklahoma, Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota and Texas. The latest network expansion investment is part of Bluepeak’s larger plans to invest more than $200 million to continue building out its network in its currently served markets, reaching more than 200,000 new locations with its fiber network in 2024 and 2025.

With Bluepeak service, customers get fiber-fast speeds, equal upload and download speeds and whole-home WiFi. Bluepeak service features all-in pricing, where the price on the website is the price on the bill, with a minimum service tier of 1 gigabit-per-second (Gbps). Homes can get up to 5 Gbps and businesses 10 Gbps and beyond. Each fiber internet speed package includes Wi-Fi powered by eero, along with the added value of eero Secure, which protects devices from online threats, ads and allows for customized content filtering. Bluepeak's fiber network provides reliable connectivity and the bandwidth to connect more devices for internet, streaming, gaming and more.

Ultimately, Bluepeak service increases broadband competition for internet consumers by providing a fast, reliable, affordable choice for internet in communities where options have traditionally been very limited.

* According to the Federal Trade Commission, competition “benefits consumers by keeping prices low and the quality and choice of goods and services high.”
* In addition, a 2020 report by Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond on “Bringing Broadband to Rural America” determined that broadband access and adoption is linked to increased job and population growth, higher rates of new business formation, higher home values, and lower unemployment rates.
