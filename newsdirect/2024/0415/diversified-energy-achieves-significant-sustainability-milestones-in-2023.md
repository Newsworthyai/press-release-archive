--News Direct--

Diversified Energy Company PLC (LSE:DEC, NYSE:DEC) Senior Vice President of Sustainability Teresa Odom discusses the company's sustainability efforts and achievements with Proactive's Stephen Gunnion.

Key highlights from the company's fifth annual sustainability report include a 33% year-over-year reduction in methane intensity and the retirement of nearly three times as many wells in 2023 as two years prior, including both company and third-party wells. The company has also contributed over $2 million to community programs and improved its sustainability performance, notably in reducing motor vehicle accidents.

Over the past five years, Odom said Diversified Energy has focused on quantitative and qualitative improvements in reporting, achieving its interim methane intensity reduction targets ahead of schedule, aiming for a 50% reduction by 2030 based on 2020 levels.

The company's social responsibility efforts include over $2 million in grants, 32 university scholarships, and 18 summer internships. With a workforce of 1,600, Odom noted that Diversified Energy promotes diversity through unconscious bias training for managers and recruitment initiatives.

Looking ahead to 2024, the company plans to focus on methane intensity reduction and compliance with new US regulations, while continuing community engagement and sustainable business growth.
