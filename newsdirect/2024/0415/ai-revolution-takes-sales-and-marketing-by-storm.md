In the fast-paced world of business, staying ahead means embracing the transformative power of technology.

At this point, companies either have to get in on artificial intelligence (AI) or risk getting left behind.

For sales and marketing, AI's impact is far-reaching, from automating routine tasks to personalizing customer interactions and everything in between. Its predictive analytics capabilities allow for sharper lead targeting, ensuring sales teams concentrate their efforts on prospects most likely to convert. It also leads to operations that are quicker, more connected, and ultimately, more productive.

AI-powered tools, including chatbots and CRM systems, are not only streamlining interactions but also providing invaluable insights that help fine-tune sales strategies. The result? A significant boost in sales productivity and a more engaging customer experience.

New research from GoDaddy reveals that entrepreneurs are rapidly adopting generative AI (GenAI) to enhance their small businesses, with expectations high for gaining a competitive advantage.1

According to a January survey of over 500 US small business owners conducted by GoDaddy, a whopping 75% believe GenAI will give them an edge over similar-sized businesses, while 68% feel it will allow them to compete more effectively against larger entities.

The uptake of GenAI among entrepreneurs has seen a significant increase, with 73% of respondents trying out the technology and 26% applying it to their business operations. This marks a substantial rise from GoDaddy's initial survey published in May 2023, which showed only 38% had experimented with GenAI, and a mere 11% had leveraged it for business purposes.

On February 26, GoDaddy introduced Airo, an AI-powered solution designed to democratize the use of AI for business enhancement. Airo simplifies the process of starting or scaling a business by offering automated solutions for creating logos, websites, emails, payment systems, and social media posts, requiring no technical expertise from the user.

GoDaddy isn’t the only one using this powerful tool to help small businesses improve sales outcomes. Leading digital marketing solutions company Wishpond Technologies Ltd.
