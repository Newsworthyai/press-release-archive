# BIMQuote Appoints New President Aimed at Delivering Cost Savings on Materials for Homebuilders

--News Direct--

BIMQuote announced the appointment of Ken Trent as President where he’ll be providing cutting-edge technology solutions that help homebuilders save on material costs for new construction builds.

Ken has a background in construction administration with a proven track record of success in cost savings and process improvements. He combines that with over 10 years of experience in eCommerce and digital technology solutions for products and services.

Formerly the Chief of Growth at Builders Capital, the #1 Private Construction Lender Nationwide, Ken implemented strategic initiatives that enhanced the borrower experience by developing online portals where customers could have 24/7 access to their draws and loan details.

“Ken is results-driven with a strong focus on the customer experience,” said Travis Dodge, BIMQuote Founder. “His vision and initiative will help private homebuilders gain greater awareness of this revolutionary software and drive home the value that BIMQuote delivers access to the same national buying power that production builders are accustomed to.”

Ken commented on the transition, stating, "My background in construction has equipped me with a strong foundation in project management and a keen eye for detail. These skills, combined with my experience in digital technology solutions provide a unique perspective that I believe will be invaluable in the adoption of BIMQuote to homebuilders nationwide. I am thrilled to be part of this innovative team and look forward to contributing to the company's continued success."

BIMQuote is currently being offered to Builders Capital borrowers, who can utilize the software to order localized building materials at discounted prices. The cost savings are based on their national relationships with hundreds of material providers from wood framing to windows, to roofing and appliances and everything in between. The materials are organized by cost code provided in detailed quantity takeoffs based on the homebuilders' submitted plans.
