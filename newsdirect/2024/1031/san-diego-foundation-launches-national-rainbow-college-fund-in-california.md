# San Diego Foundation Launches National Rainbow College Fund in California

Today, San Diego Foundation (SDF) launched the National Rainbow College Fund (NRCF) in California, the first scholarship designed to exclusively support LGBTQ+ students pursuing their ambitions for higher education regardless of the public nature of their sexual and gender identity.

The National Rainbow College Fund is powered by San Diego Foundation, one of the largest community foundations in the U.S. and the largest provider of scholarships of any community foundation in California. The mission of the National Rainbow College Fund is to lessen the financial burden for young people who identify as LGBTQ+ or who are grappling with the secrecy of remaining in the closet. The groundbreaking fund addresses the unique challenges LGBTQ+ students face such as social acceptance, mental health issues and family rejection that can hinder their ability to afford college that in turn impacts long-term economic earning power.

“Speaking from personal experience, I know that many young people struggle with the fear of being outed or coming out. It can be overwhelming. Like many young people, I did everything possible to hide who I was because I feared being kicked out of my home and my family, as well as being cut off financially and emotionally,” said Mark Stuart, President and CEO of San Diego Foundation. “Every LGBTQ+ person should have the means to realize their educational dreams, regardless of the public nature of their sexual and gender identity.”

The $2,500 award per selected student may be used for tuition, books, fees, room and board and other educational expenses. It does not need to be repaid. The application period is from January 15, 2025 – March 5, 2025. San Diego Foundation will make students’ privacy the highest priority during the application process. All information submitted to the application portal will be confidential.

Setting the precedent in California, San Diego Foundation’s vision is for the fund to grow to be a national source of financial aid for LGBTQ+ students to attend the technical school, college or university of their choosing.

To apply, a student who identifies as LGBTQ+ whether publicly or privately must be a high school senior; an incoming or current college or university student; or an adult re-entry student. Applicants need to have lived in California for at least one year and must demonstrate financial need by completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), the California DREAM Act Application or the Federal Student Aid Estimator Tool. Students must plan to enroll in at least 6 units in an accredited public or nonprofit community college; four-year university or trade/vocational school anywhere within the United States.

The need for this scholarship is well-documented. According to a survey conducted by Student Loan Hero, LGBTQ+ students face significant barriers in paying for their education. Families may not financially support their children, leading LGBTQ+ students to turn to loans to finance their schooling. LGBTQ+ borrowers had a higher debt burden on average, with $16,000 more than their cisgender/heterosexual peers: 60% of LGBTQ+ student loan borrowers regret taking out student loans; 28% feel that they can’t manage their student loan payments and more than 53% reported earning less than $50,000 per year. For every $1,000 scholarship a student receives, they are 5% more likely to complete their education.

Privacy remains a major concern. A 2022 study from the Williams Institute found that LGBTQ+ students are four times more likely than non-LGBTQ+ students to choose college in a state with a more welcoming climate and to live away from family; 60% of white LGBTQ+ students are not out to staff/faculty and less than 40% of LGBTQ+ students of color are out to staff/faculty. Community colleges have even higher rates of keeping sexual identity private: more than 70% white LGBTQ+ students and 65% LGBTQ+ students of color are not out.

LGBTQ+ rights have been under increased attack in general, but also transgender and gender diverse communities in particular. This political landscape is the backdrop by which teenagers are navigating their identities while emerging into adulthood. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a study documenting that approximately 3.3% of high school students identify as transgender and another 2.2% are questioning their gender identity. Transgender and gender-questioning teenagers reported alarmingly higher rates of bullying at school, persistent sadness and suicidal thoughts and behavior. About one in four transgender students said they had attempted suicide in the past year, compared with 11% of cisgender girls and 5% of cisgender boys.
