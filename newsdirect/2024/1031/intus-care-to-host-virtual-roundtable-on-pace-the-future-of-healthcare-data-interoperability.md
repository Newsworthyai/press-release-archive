# Intus Care to Host Virtual Roundtable on “PACE & The Future of Healthcare Data Interoperability”

Intus Care, a technology leader in the PACE market, will host a virtual conversation on “PACE and the Future of Healthcare Data Interoperability” with prominent guests within healthcare and the PACE (Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) community. Intus Care Cofounder and CEO Robbie Felton will moderate a discussion among Shawn Bloom, CEO and president of the National PACE Association (NPA); Dr. David Feinberg, Chairman of Oracle Health (formerly CEO of Cerner); and Stephanie Rock, Vice President of Product at Intus Care.

The discussion will center around healthcare system interoperability, the importance of interoperability, and the current interoperability challenges that remain. In particular, the conversation will focus around:

* What can the PACE community learn from modern interoperability standards by the broader value-based care community?
* Why does PACE need an interoperable and modular technology strategy as the model expands?

The hour virtual roundtable is scheduled for Thursday, November 14 at 1 p.m. ET. Anyone interested in interoperability, healthcare, and PACE is invited to listen to the discussion. Registration is open now.

PACE is a “comprehensive, fully integrated, provider-based health plan for the frailest and costliest members of our society – those who require a nursing home level of care,” according to the National PACE Association. The goal, however, is to provide care that allows those enrolled to continue living at home and in their communities. Nationally, 95% of participants continue to live at home. The model is now considered the gold standard for seniors with complex care needs.

According to the NPA, there are currently 178 PACE programs serving more than 78,500 participants in 33 states and the District of Columbia. As the U.S. population ages – adults 65 years or older will increase 30%, from 63 million to 82 million, accounting for nearly one-quarter of the U.S. population by 2050 – the need for PACE to expand will only increase.

To scale effectively, PACE organizations need technology that meets their needs, including a unified documentation system that integrates and shares data securely and seamlessly. "The future of interoperability in PACE lies in seamless data sharing across care teams, empowering providers to deliver truly coordinated, patient-centered care," said Felton. "While progress has been made, there are still regulatory and technological hurdles for this to be truly realized for PACE organizations, but its realization will unlock unprecedented value and transform how we care for our aging population. I look forward to unpacking this with our esteemed guests for the virtual fireside chat."

Registration for the virtual roundtable is open now. A recording will be available following the event for individuals unable to attend live.
