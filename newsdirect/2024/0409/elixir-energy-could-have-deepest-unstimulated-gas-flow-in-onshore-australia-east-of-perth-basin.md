# Elixir Energy could have deepest unstimulated gas flow in onshore Australia, east of Perth Basin

--News Direct--

Elixir Energy Ltd (ASX:EXR) managing director Neil Young joins Proactiveâ€™s Jonathan Jackson to discuss a significant gas find at its 100%-owned Grandis project in Queensland, potentially marking the deepest unstimulated gas flow in onshore Australia, east of the Perth Basin. Young shares insights on the discovery and its implications for the Australian gas industry. Situated adjacent to the Wallumbilla gas hub, the Grandis project's Lorelle Sandstone at the Daydream-2 well exhibited an impressive initial flow test, achieving a stabilised rate of 1.3 million standard cubic feet per day, peaking at 2.3 million without stimulation. This achievement is not just a one-off event but a significant indicator of the Taroom Trough's unconventional resource potential. Young expressed enthusiasm about the results, stating that the Lorelle Sandstone is poised to substantially enhance the project's output and economic prospects. He talks us through the stimulation phase to come and hints that this could be the beginning of a new, strategically located gas play in Queensland, which could be crucial in addressing the looming domestic gas shortage.
