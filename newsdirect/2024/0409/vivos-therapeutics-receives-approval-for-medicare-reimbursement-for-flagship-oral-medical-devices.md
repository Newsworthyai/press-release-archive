# Vivos Therapeutics receives approval for Medicare reimbursement for flagship Oral Medical Devices

--News Direct--

Vivos Therapeutics CEO Kirk Huntsman joined Steve Darling from Proactive shared significant news regarding the regulatory approval for Medicare reimbursement of their oral medical devices designed for sleep apnea treatment. Huntsman emphasized the unique design of Vivos's medical devices, which are capable of enhancing the human airway and potentially eliminating sleep apnea symptoms after a 12-month treatment period. This FDA clearance positions Vivos as the only line of oral medical devices globally that can treat severe sleep apnea.

The approval for Medicare reimbursement is described as a monumental achievement, as it is expected to benefit tens of millions of Medicare patients suffering from moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) without the need for lifetime intervention. This recognition by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) propels Vivos's devices as a viable alternative to traditional CPAP treatments, especially timely given the recent recalls in the CPAP market and Philips' withdrawal from the U.S. market.

Huntsman expressed his excitement about the broader implications of this approval, including increased recommendations of Vivos's treatments by medical and dental providers and a growing awareness of their efficacy as an alternative to CPAP treatments. This development represents a significant step forward in transforming patient care for individuals suffering from sleep apnea.
