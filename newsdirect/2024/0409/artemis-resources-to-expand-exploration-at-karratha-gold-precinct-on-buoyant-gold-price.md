# Artemis Resources to expand exploration at Karratha Gold Precinct on buoyant gold price

--News Direct--

Artemis Resources Ltd (ASX:ARV, AIM:ARV, OTCQB:ARTTF) executive director George Ventouras joins Proactive's Stephen Gunnion with details of the company's upcoming exploration plans at the Karratha Gold Precinct in Western Australia.

Within the precinct, Ventouras noted that the Carlow Project boasts a resource of over 700,000 ounces of gold equivalent, highlighting its significant size and promising grades of two and a half grammes per tonne.

With gold prices in focus, he said the company is allocating part of its exploration budget towards both the Carlow project and the wider tenement package to uncover additional prospects. This year, Artemis Resources is excited about prospects at Lulu Creek, supported by a government grant for co-funded drilling. This area, showing similarities with the 10 million-ounce De Grey's Hemi deposit, revealed promising initial drilling results in 2020, with gold grades of 4.89 grammes per tonne.

Drilling is expected to commence in the third quarter of 2024, following heritage clearances, with preparatory activities such as rock chips and soil sampling underway.

Additionally, Artemis Resources continues exploration in other areas, including lithium prospects, underlining the company's dual focus on base metals and future-facing metals. Ventouras emphasizes the potential of their intrusive gold systems as a frontier for large gold systems, indicating a promising future for Artemis Resources.
