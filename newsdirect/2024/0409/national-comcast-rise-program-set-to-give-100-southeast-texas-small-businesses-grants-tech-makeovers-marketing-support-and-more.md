Today, Comcast announced Houston would be one of five cities from which eligible small businesses can apply to its nationally recognized Comcast RISE program for the opportunity to receive business support grants. The program will provide a total of $500,000 in grants plus technology make-overs, marketing support, media schedules, coaching sessions and education support.

“Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and are essential to building strong and thriving local communities,” said Loren Hudson, SVP and Chief Diversity Officer at Comcast. “Comcast RISE is proud to help strengthen and empower these businesses and entrepreneurs to expand and grow.”

Beginning on May 1 through May 31, eligible businesses in Houston; Atlanta, GA; Southern Colorado; Jacksonville, FL and Richmond, VA can apply for a chance to receive a grant package at www.ComcastRISE.com. One hundred businesses per city, 500 in total, will be awarded business support grants that will include:

* COACHING SESSIONS - General business assessment and coaching that provides business owners with recommendations on how to grow their businesses.
* EDUCATION RESOURCES - 12-month access to online entrepreneurship courses, learning modules and resources for small business owners.
* MONETARY GRANT - $5,000 monetary grant.
* CREATIVE PRODUCTION & MEDIA - Turnkey production of a 30-second TV commercial, plus a media strategy consultation and 180-day media placement schedule. (Taxes and other fees may apply for production and media services.)
* COMCAST BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY MAKEOVER - Computer equipment, Internet, voice and cybersecurity services for 12 months. (Taxes and other fees may apply for tech makeover services.)

Past Houston area Comcast RISE recipients include Mala Sichuan Bistro, LAMIK Beauty and 132 Design.

“Comcast RISE came in with support at the perfect time. We didn't just expand our office and reach; we were instantly plugged into a community of support,” said Ashley Gomez, co-founder of 132 Design. “Being part of the Comcast RISE family truly opened the floodgates to new opportunities. Now we are helping to lift other businesses here in the city we love.”

Comcast RISE is part of Project UP, the company’s comprehensive initiative to advance digital equity through programs and partnerships that connect people to the Internet, advance economic mobility and open doors for the next generation of innovators, entrepreneurs, storytellers and creators.
