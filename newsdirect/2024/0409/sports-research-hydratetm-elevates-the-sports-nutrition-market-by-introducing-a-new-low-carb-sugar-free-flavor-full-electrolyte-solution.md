# Sports Research Hydrate™ Elevates the Sports Nutrition Market by Introducing A New Low-Carb, Sugar-Free, Flavor Full Electrolyte Solution

--News Direct--

Sports Research®, the premier family-owned and operated company for vitamins, supplements and performance essentials, is proud to announce the highly anticipated launch of its first powdered electrolyte product line Sports Research Hydrate™. Entering into an already competitive electrolyte market with well-established brands, Sports Research looks to stand out as an industry leader by educating consumers on the benefits of using hydration products. In today’s health-conscious consumer landscape, Sports Research has identified a demand for enhanced transparency and quality in the electrolyte market.

This sugar-free, low-carb electrolyte powder enhances consumer health in more ways than one. Unlike rival brands, Sports Research Hydrate comes in an ideal 2:1 Sodium-to-Potassium ratio, ensuring optimal electrolyte levels and defense against fluid loss. Each serving is filled with over 65 trace minerals, seven essential vitamins and is further enhanced with coconut water. These ingredients provide essential nutrients to support bodily functions like enzyme activity and immune response, aiding in hydration and electrolyte balance, and contributing to overall well-being. This combination sets a new standard for redefining hydration with its flavorful taste while also ensuring a better way to hydrate for those prioritizing optimal health and wellness.

"We chose to enter the electrolyte market because we understand the various needs of today's active individuals and felt they weren’t being fully met," says Mike Pedersen, COO at Sports Research. “There’s a growing demand for products that are low carb, don’t consist of any artificial sugars and cater to dietary preferences, such as vegan and keto, while still maintaining the utmost levels of quality and transparency. With our expertise in performance-enhancing products, like Sweet Sweat, we recognize the importance of replenishing electrolytes and mineral levels lost through sweating during intense workouts. Introducing Hydrate as a holistic solution further advances our commitment to supporting athletes in the sport of life.”

Electrolytes have numerous health benefits, including ensuring proper nerve function while balancing and maintaining bodily fluids such as sweat. Electrolytes can be lost through sweat during vigorous training and exercise. Replenishing them can help avoid dehydration, muscle cramps, and fatigue while also enhancing energy production to help facilitate nerve signaling for optimal cognitive function and neurological health.

Held to the highest standard, Sports Research Hydrate packets are Non-GMO Project Verified, Vegan Friendly, Gluten-Free and Informed Sport tested for banned substances– a testament to Sports Research's commitment to providing research-backed performance essentials. Whether training for a marathon, watching carb intake, or balancing multiple responsibilities as a working parent, Sports Research Hydrate is the perfect solution to refresh, refuel, and recover.

One Sports Research Hydrate recyclable box contains 16 individual stick packs, offered in four individual flavors or a variety pack that contains them all: Raspberry Lemonade, Cherry Pomegranate, Lemon Lime, and Passion Fruit.

Sports Research Hydrate is now available for purchase on www.sportsresearch.com/hydrate and Amazon for $22.95.
