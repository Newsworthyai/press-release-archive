# Far East Gold logs high-grade gold, boosts strike at Woyla’s Victory Vein

--News Direct--

Far East Gold Ltd (ASX:FEG) CEO Shane Menere chats to Proactive’s Elisha Newell after the company dug into high-grade gold at the Woyla project’s Aloe Rek prospect in Indonesia. Field mapping completed across the Woyla tenure also indicates that a low-sulphidation epithermal gold vein system, known as Victory Vein, extends to 18.5 kilometres (up substantially from the previous 13-kilometre reading). Menere says that while the high grade gold encountered in Aloe Rek’s first drill hole is certainly encouraging, the newly identified 5.5-kilometre stretch at Victory Vein represents an exciting exploration opportunity that’s yet to be drill tested.
