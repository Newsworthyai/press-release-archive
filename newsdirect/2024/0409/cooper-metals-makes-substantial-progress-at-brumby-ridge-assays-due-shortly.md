# Cooper Metals makes substantial progress at Brumby Ridge; assays due shortly

--News Direct--

Cooper Metals Ltd (ASX:CPM) managing director Ian Warland tells Proactiveâ€™s Jonathan Jackson that the company is making substantial progress at its Brumby Ridge Project in northwest Queensland, having recently completed a significant drilling campaign. The campaign comprised four diamond drill holes spanning 1,054 metres and five reverse circulation (RC) drill holes covering 1,044 metres. With around 500 samples under analysis at a laboratory in Mount Isa, expectations are high for the late April results. The drilling has yielded positive preliminary findings, notably from three scissor holes which followed up on a previous drill hole that encountered 71 metres at 2.8% copper. One such hole, 24MERC003, revealed over 60 metres of visual disseminated sulphides and intersected a mineralised fault breccia zone, suggesting a complex geological structure at play. Warland expressed optimism about the project's potential, noting the extensive disseminated sulphides and the mineralised fault breccia zone's significance. Despite current weather-related pauses in drilling, plans are set to resume shortly, with a comprehensive RC drilling program targeting multiple prospects. Cooper Metals is poised for a busy period of exploration and development, aiming to further uncover the extent and grade of the mineralisation at Brumby Ridge and surrounding prospects. With the assays pending and further drilling on the horizon, the company is at a pivotal point in assessing the full potential of this promising project.
