# Bitget Introduces Stake-to-Mine Platform PoolX with ChatAI as the first Project

--News Direct--

Bitget, the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange and Web3 company, is excited to unveil PoolX, a pioneering stake-to-mine platform, that according to the team allows users to stake specific coins to potentially earn popular tokens in a seamless manner. Starting off with the ChatAI project, PoolX features an AI-driven social and gaming platform on the Solana blockchain.

The team states that each PoolX project will feature one or more mining pools, with potential token rewards distributed hourly based on participants' staking volume. Hourly snapshots of staked amounts will be taken to ensure accurate calculations of users' proportionate shares and rewards. Each mining pool on PoolX calculates its Annual Percentage Rate (APR) separately, providing users with diverse opportunities to maximize their potential token earnings. Furthermore, the team states that users enjoy the flexibility to redeem the staked tokens at any time, with staked assets automatically returning to their spot accounts after the mining period ends.

The inaugural project on PoolX is ChatAI, a dynamic social and gaming platform powered by AI and based on the Solana blockchain. With a rapidly growing community spanning Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Nigeria, Vietnam, and beyond, ChatAI has amassed over 5 million registered users. Among them, there are over 1 million active users per month and 500,000+ concurrent users daily across more than 170 countries.

Gracy Chen, Managing Director of Bitget, states: "PoolX marks a significant advancement in our commitment to empowering users with innovative crypto solutions. With its user-centric design and robust features, PoolX will redefine the token farming experience, offering greater flexibility and profitability to our users."
