# Investments & Wealth Institute and CEG Worldwide Announce Research Partnership to Accelerate Success for Financial Advisors and Elevate HNW Client Experiences

--News Direct--

The Investments & Wealth Institute (the Institute)—the premier professional association, education provider, and standards body for financial advisors—has announced its partnership with CEG Worldwide, an elite financial advisor coaching, research, and consulting firm, at the Institute’s flagship annual conference, Experience 2024, in Las Vegas.

CEG Insights—CEG Worldwide’s research arm dedicated to providing knowledge of the concerns and expectations of high-net-worth (HNW) families and the best practices of the industry’s top financial advisors—will collaborate with the Institute to create several types of research deliverables to enterprise, team, and individual stakeholders who serve or aspire to serve HNW clients.

“At the Investments & Wealth Institute, our mission is to deliver premier investment and wealth management education to help financial advisors better serve their clients,” said Sean R. Walters, CAE®, Chief Executive Officer for the Institute. “Our 2023 Institute member-needs survey indicated that nearly 70 percent of our members already find Investments & Wealth Research—a component of the Institute’s Investments & Wealth Monitor publication—to be a valuable member benefit. We expect this partnership with CEG Worldwide to further enhance our research offering as CEG has an unparalleled understanding of how elite advisors who operate in the HNW space can further elevate their practices to be successful and provide even more successful outcomes for clients.”

“Our collaboration with the Investments & Wealth Institute is a game-changer for financial advisors who serve high-net-worth clients,” said John Bowen, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of CEG Worldwide. “By combining the Institute's deep industry knowledge with CEG's expertise in understanding the needs and expectations of wealthy families, we will create powerful resources that enable advisors to elevate their practices and deliver unparalleled value.”

The research partnership in its first year includes:

Custom & Semi-Custom Research Reports for Corporate Clients—The Institute and CEG Insights will jointly develop and deliver co-branded, custom research to interested Institute enterprise (firm-level) clients who seek help in solving the needs that their advisor teams have to be able to improve and grow their businesses and better serve HNW clients. The topic of these research projects will be driven by the enterprise client and based on a negotiated fee agreed upon by the Institute, CEG Insights, and the enterprise client involved.

Wealth Management Mastery Series—CEG Insights already offers a subscription service to its stakeholders via the Wealth Management Mastery Series, a highly regarded research series that provides a wide range of knowledge and strategies for successfully serving HNW clients. The Institute will help promote a curated version of the Mastery Series to its enterprise clients who represent potential prospects for CEG in an effort to further expand awareness and adoption.

Investments & Wealth Research Series—Since 2008, the Investments & Wealth Monitor has provided IWI members with a quarterly research publication called Investments & Wealth Research. This informative series delivers practice-oriented topics designed to help members better serve their clients and distinguish their expertise in a global, and highly competitive marketplace. CEG Insights will work with IWI editorial staff to develop and deliver new research findings as part of this series.

The May/June Investments & Wealth Monitor will feature an article by CEG's Bowen on bridging the wealth management divide. The article will reveal substantial gaps between the services advisors report providing and what clients perceive they receive. At Experience, Bowen will present CEG Insights' latest findings, suggesting that now is an ideal time to work with affluent entrepreneurs: 20% of those surveyed, with an average of $15.6 million in assets, will likely change advisors within two years.
