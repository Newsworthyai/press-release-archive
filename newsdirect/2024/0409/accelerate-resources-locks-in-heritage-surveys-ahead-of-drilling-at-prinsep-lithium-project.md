# Accelerate Resources locks in heritage surveys ahead of drilling at Prinsep Lithium Project

--News Direct--

Accelerate Resources Ltd (ASX:AX8) CEO Luke Meter sits down with Jonathan Jackson in the Proactive studio to discuss how the company is on the brink of starting its maiden drilling program at the Prinsep Lithium Project in Western Australia. Meter emphasises the completion of Heritage and Ethnographic surveys in collaboration with the Ngarluma Aboriginal Corporation (NAC). Scheduled for mid-April, these surveys will span the 1.8-kilometre strike of both northern and southern lithium pegmatite trends at Prinsep. This area is notable for its promising rock chip assays, reporting lithium grades as high as 2.06%. Meter expressed gratitude to the NAC for their swift action in scheduling the heritage survey, underscoring the importance of their partnership as the project progresses. He also highlighted the rapid advancements in the project timeline, with the heritage surveys acting as a precursor to the drilling phase. The Program of Works, detailing the exploration and drilling plans over the surveyed areas, is under review by the Department of Energy, Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety. Accelerate Resources is poised to begin drilling immediately upon receiving the necessary approvals, marking a significant step forward in exploiting the lithium potential at Prinsep.
