# Kula Gold continues 2024 gold focus

--News Direct--

Kula Gold Ltd (ASX:KGD) managing director Ric Dawson sits down with Proactive’s Jonathan Jackson to discuss the strides that the company is making in gold exploration, which is its primary focus in 2024. The company recently reported promising gold mineralisation, with notable assays at the historic Camilleri Mine and Jarvis prospects, indicating gold grades up to 11.2 g/t. This discovery aligns with Kula Gold’s strategic focus on gold and lithium across Western Australia, including the Kirup and Marvel Loch projects. Kula Gold is advancing its exploration endeavours near historical gold mines and the company’s diversified portfolio and strategic land holdings in mineral-rich regions underscore its potential for hosting significant deposits.
