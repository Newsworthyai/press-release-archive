Today, Comcast announced 100 businesses in Southern Colorado will receive comprehensive grant packages that include business coaching sessions, education resources, a $5,000 monetary grant, creative production, and technology makeovers. Comcast RISE is committed to supporting the growth of all small businesses, while advancing the objectives of diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as community investment. The program is built to help businesses and their communities thrive with a focus on economic growth.

“Comcast is committed to supporting and empowering small businesses in our communities,” said J.D. Keller, senior vice president of Comcast’s Mountain West Region. “The Comcast RISE program will deliver innovative and impactful resources that can make a lasting impact on small businesses in Pueblo.”

Beginning on May 1, and through May 31, eligible businesses in Pueblo and Pueblo County can apply for a grant package at www.ComcastRISE.com. A total of 100 grants in Southern Colorado, and 500 grants overall, will be announced in August 2024, bringing the total number of recipients to date to 14,000.

“Small businesses drive innovation, create jobs, and enrich the fabric of our community,” said Pueblo Mayor Heather Graham. “Through dedicated support and investments like the Comcast RISE program, entrepreneurs are empowered to grow their businesses.”

Comcast RISE was created in November 2020 to help small businesses hardest hit by COVID-19, from bakeries and barber shops to childcare centers and cleaning services, by providing the grants needed to survive and recover.

The program has evolved from helping businesses survive the pandemic, to helping businesses and their communities thrive with a focus on economic growth.

Grant packages will include:

CONSULTATION - General business assessment and coaching that provides business owners with recommendations on how to grow their businesses.

EDUCATION RESOURCES - 12-month access to online entrepreneurship courses, learning modules and resources for small business owners.

MONETARY GRANT - $5,000 monetary grant.

CREATIVE PRODUCTION & MEDIA - Turnkey production of a 30-second TV commercial, plus a media strategy consultation and a 180-day media schedule. (Taxes and other fees may apply for production and media services.)

TECHNOLOGY MAKEOVER - Computer equipment and Internet, Voice and Cybersecurity services for 12 months. (Taxes and other fees may apply for tech makeover services.)

In addition, any small business owner can visit the Comcast RISE destination on X1 featuring aggregated small business news, tips, insights, and more. X1 customers can say “Comcast RISE” into the voice remote.

Comcast RISE is part of Project UP, the company’s $1 billion commitment to advance digital equity through programs and community partnerships that connect people to the Internet, advance economic mobility and open doors for the next generation of innovators, entrepreneurs, storytellers and creators.
