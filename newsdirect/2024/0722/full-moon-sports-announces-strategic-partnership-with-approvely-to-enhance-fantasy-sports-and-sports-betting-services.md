Full Moon Sports, a leading sports consulting company specializing in fantasy sports, sports betting and horse racing, is thrilled to announce a multi-layered partnership with Approvely, a premier merchant service, fraud protection and chargeback protection provider for online businesses. Full Moon Sports, led by Fantasy Sports Hall of Famer, Rick Wolf and Horse Racing and Sports Betting Stalwart, Michael Zapin, finds solutions for sports businesses and Approvely is the perfect solution for those in these three industries that are labeled by merchant services as “risky."

Full Moon Sports has added many partnerships in the recent months to solidify their ability to protect the industries that they love with the best possible partners. The partnership with Approvely addresses one of the most difficult areas for digital businesses to solve.

“Approvely is taking a unique approach to payments. They are actively engaging with our industry and seeking feedback on building the products we urgently need. For instance, based on market feedback, they launched an instant payout product at the end of last year,” said Rick Wolf, Founder of Full Moon Sports. “This product allows DFS and online gaming companies to pay their players instantly without being burdened by large minimum commitments. Approvely's dedication to our industry and support for startups make them the ideal partner for us.”

“Partnering with Full Moon Sports was important for Approvely as it gets us association with top-notch individuals with the ability to bring business faster in three major sectors,” said Chelsie Cooper, CEO of Approvely. “Our completion of the necessary technological changes for pari-mutuel wagering and compliance oriented partnerships for fantasy sports and sports betting means that this is a perfect fit.
