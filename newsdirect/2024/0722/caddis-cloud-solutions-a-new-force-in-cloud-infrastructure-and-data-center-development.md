# Caddis Cloud Solutions: A New Force in Cloud Infrastructure and Data Center Development

Today marks the debut of Caddis Cloud Solutions, a global advisory firm specializing in Data Center development, cloud capacity sourcing and end-user deployment. Previously known as CloudSphere Consulting, Caddis is poised to leverage its deep industry expertise to help its clients around the globe provide and capture cloud capacity.

The global data center market is projected to grow to $792.29 billion by 2032, marking a 241% increase from 2023. According to CBRE, as of the first quarter of this year, roughly half of the current data center capacity is under construction, with 84% already allocated.

"Today, there is a critical shortage of cloud capacity to meet the burgeoning demand for cloud space. Our mission at Caddis is to help bridge this gap and deliver cutting-edge solutions that address the complex demands of the modern data center landscape," said Scott Jarnagin, founder and CEO of Caddis.

Within this rapidly expanding market, Caddis sets itself apart through its comprehensive, end-to-end service model. On the supply side, the company collaborates with real estate developers, infrastructure firms, and data center operators to enhance cloud capacity. Additionally, Caddis works closely with hyperscalers and AI/GPU infrastructure providers to identify opportunities for increasing cloud capacity for their clients. In each engagement, the Caddis team delivers tailored solutions, enabling stakeholders to navigate complexities and achieve their technological and operational goals.

To further highlight its distinct approach, Caddis emphasizes a collaborative strategy that combines industry-leading technology with strategic partnerships. This synergy not only accelerates the deployment of high-demand infrastructure but also ensures that clients benefit from scalable cloud solutions. Through innovative project management and a commitment to excellence, Caddis is transforming the landscape of cloud infrastructure.

Caddis is led by Jarnagin, who brings over 25 years of industry experience. Prior to founding Caddis, he led cloud service deployments as the head of the Site Selection team at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. His extensive background also includes a high-visibility role at Microsoft, where he specialized in global project management, vendor management, and infrastructure as a service.

“Caddis Cloud Solutions is not just a new name in the industry, we are a new paradigm in cloud infrastructure development. We are committed to building strategic partnerships and innovative projects that pave the way for future advancements,” said Jarnagin. “As we continue to expand, we are steadfastly focused on launching groundbreaking projects globally and forging strategic partnerships that reinforce our status as a leader in comprehensive cloud and data center solutions.”
