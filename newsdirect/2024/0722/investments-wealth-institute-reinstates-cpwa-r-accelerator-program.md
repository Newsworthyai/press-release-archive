# Investments & Wealth Institute Reinstates CPWA® Accelerator Program

The Investments & Wealth Institute is pleased to announce the reinstatement of the Accelerate Certified Private Wealth Advisor® (CPWA®) program, which offers CPWA candidates an intensive, expedited approach for earning the prestigious CPWA certification. Accelerate 2024 combines asynchronous self-study with synchronous online executive education, benefitting CPWA candidates with a flexible, rigorous learning experience.

To earn the CPWA certification applicants must pass a comprehensive background check, demonstrate five years of experience in financial services, and complete an executive education program at Yale School of Management, Chicago Booth School of Business, or through the Investments & Wealth Institute. Candidates must also pass a four-hour, comprehensive certification exam at an approved testing center or via an approved online proctored provider. More than 300 hours of study are recommended for CPWA candidates, regardless of the education option selected at time of application.

Enrollment for the Accelerate 2024 CPWA program began July 16, 2024. Once applications are completed online and approved, new candidates will start the program on September 4, 2024, with a live orientation webinar, then navigate the self-study curriculum throughout the fall. The program concludes with a week of live online executive education from December 2-5, 2024. Candidates who successfully complete all self-study module quizzes and attend all executive education sessions will be eligible to schedule their CPWA certification exam within 21 days of program completion. Candidates who need a more flexible timeline can continue self-study and exam preparation into 2025.

The Accelerate 2024 CPWA program is designed to address the dynamic needs of advisors serving high-net-worth clients. Key features of the three-month program include extended online self-study, virtual flashcards accessible via phone and tablet apps, an updated quiz bank, and multiple exam prep videos. Additionally, participants will benefit from more than 34 hours of live instructor-led executive education, which will be recorded and available on-demand, allowing candidates to review the materials at their own pace.

Program Highlights:

* Comprehensive Online Self-Study: Available through the Institute’s Academy — a premier online educational platform offering flexible, high-quality learning opportunities for financial advisory professionals — the program features knowledge checks and section quizzes to reinforce learning and ensure mastery of complex topics.
* Executive Education: Intensive live online sessions led by expert CPWA faculty, with recordings available for future reference. This format allows participants to engage with top-tier instructors and peers from anywhere in the world.
* Flexible Scheduling: Candidates have the option to prepare for and schedule their CPWA certification exam at their convenience, allowing them to tailor their study plan to their personal and professional commitments.
* Affordable Tuition: Priced at $6,295 for open enrollment, with various scholarships and group discounts available. Special pricing options include $5,995 for groups of five and $5,795 for groups of ten, complete with private orientation and personalized syllabus with the company logo.

"We are thrilled to be offering this intensive path to CPWA certification," said Mike Kurz, CIMA®, CPWA®, RMA®, CFP®, CAIA®, Director of Programs at the Institute. "This program not only provides a rigorous and comprehensive curriculum but also reflects our commitment to delivering practical, high-quality education that empowers busy, fully committed financial professionals to excel in their careers. The enhancements we've made ensure that our candidates receive the best possible preparation, in a very efficient timeframe, to meet the demands of their roles — and to exceed client expectations."

To further support candidates, the Institute is offering the CPWA Accelerator Pack. Priced at $595, this optional pack is designed to instill greater test-taking confidence and skills, while helping candidates create personalized study plans for their individual learning styles. The CPWA Accelerator Pack includes a CPWA Online Exam Prep Course, which teaches techniques for analyzing test questions and previewing answers. The pack also offers unlimited certification exam retakes within one year of registration, ensuring candidates can take the exam multiple times without incurring additional exam fees.

The CPWA Accelerator Pack does not include a practice examination, but rather focuses on practicing methodical dissection of questions using case studies and scenarios that align with topics in the CPWA curriculum. The CPWA Accelerator Pack provides printed copies of all online self-study readings, organized into four spiral-bound binders. These printed materials offer a convenient way for candidates to review and make notes, complementing the digital curriculum and enhancing the overall study experience. Available for a limited time, the CPWA Accelerator Pack is a resource for candidates aiming to maximize their exam readiness and achieve CPWA certification with confidence. It may be purchased only by current CPWA program candidates within the first 60 days of the start of the Chicago Booth or Investments & Wealth Institute CPWA Program.

The Accelerate 2024 CPWA program is designed to address the most critical areas of wealth management, including tax planning, portfolio management, risk management, estate planning, and retirement management. By participating in this program, advisors will gain advanced knowledge and practical skills that are directly applicable to their professional roles, enhancing their ability to attract new clients, grow their business, and establish themselves as authorities in wealth management.
