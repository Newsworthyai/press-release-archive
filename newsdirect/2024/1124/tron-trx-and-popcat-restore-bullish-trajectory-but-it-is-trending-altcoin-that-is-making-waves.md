The rivalry between meme coins and DeFi coins for the best investment potential is subtly present in the crypto market. Despite the obvious lack of genuine utility in most, meme coins have always led investment gains with their community support.

This Q4 marks a chance for some of them to shine again, including Popcat (POPCAT), whose growth is poised to contend with Tron (TRX), a top DeFi token. Meanwhile, a new meme coin, Cutoshi (CUTO), is also exhibiting potential of outperforming top altcoins with its DeFi-oriented MemeFi platform.

Cutoshi Attracts Risk-Averse Crypto Investors Into Its Lucrative MemeFi Ecosystem As a hybrid cryptocurrency with a DeFi-based ecosystem and a meme-backed platform, Cutoshi (CUTO) is emerging as the next meme coin with potential for huge gains. With its devotion to Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision, which entails privacy, decentralization and monetary freedom, Cutoshi aims to offer its users a standardized DeFi environment where they can participate in beneficial DeFi activities.

These activities start from its main allure, a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol where its users can trade cryptocurrencies across multi-chains while allowing peer-to-peer. Additionally, Cutoshi provides users with a way to maximize their holdings through a token farming model. Here, they can engage in community-focused challenges and quests to win token rewards, NFTs and more.

Featuring a Learning Hub in its ecosystem, dedicated to spreading the teachings of DeFi. Cutoshi has attracted huge interest as its presale has now accumulated over $1,000,000, set for more gains, potentially surpassing all meme coins, including Popcat.

Popular Meme Coin Analyst Hints On The Need To Be Bullish On Popcat Token In an earlier post on X, Murad, a famous meme coin analyst, emphasized why Popcat will be bullish this year. Murad first hinted at the bullishness of Bitcoin before he further added that this would spark a bull market for Solana, which will directly influence the Popcat token.

Interestingly, POPCAT token’s technical analysis further points to a strong buy, which suggests a sustained trend and an imminent surge in the near future.

Coupled with that, in another X post, Murad also claimed that the POPCAT token is a better meme coin than Shiba Inu, sparking a mixed reaction among meme coin enthusiasts. Meanwhile, more investors are incredibly holding POPCAT in preparation for the next bull market.

Tron Token Experiences Significant Price Jump Restoring Its Bull Trajectory Tron coin (TRX) has had one of the most resilient trajectories throughout the year, due to its highly fluctuating performance. At the moment, its weekly price ranges from $0.19 to $0.2003.

The price of Tron has seen over 25% gain in the past month.

The past week, Tron coin was able to secure a 7.55% gain. Tron’s network is also gaining activity, as its network volume just pumped by 9.17%.

Will Cutoshi Surpass Popcat In The Month Of Its Launch?Cutoshi’s launch in the meme coin market is significant due to its unique MemeFi approach and ties to the lucrative DeFi market, all of which Popcat lacks. In other words, Cutoshi is well-positioned to outperform Popcat and even top DeFi coins in the month of its launch.
