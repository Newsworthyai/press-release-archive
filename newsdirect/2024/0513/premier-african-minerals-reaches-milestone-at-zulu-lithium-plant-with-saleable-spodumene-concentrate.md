# Premier African Minerals reaches milestone at Zulu lithium plant with saleable spodumene concentrate

--News Direct--

Premier African Minerals Ltd (AIM:PREM, OTC:PRMMF) chief executive George Roach joined Proactive's Stephen Gunnion with an update on the company's Zulu lithium plant in Zimbabwe and the next steps to reach full capacity.

Roach detailed the successful continuous operation of the plant's flotation circuit, which is now producing saleable spodumene concentrate. He discussed ongoing optimisations to enhance the plant's performance, including modifications to increase the energy used in the scrubbing process before flotation. He noted that spodumene recovery rates in lab tests were as high as 80-90%.

Despite these advances, the plant is currently operating at only 50% of its designed throughput capacity, targeting 50 tonnes per day, with plans to rapidly scale up operations. Roach also highlighted the internal development of a new reagent that has contributed to higher-than-expected recovery rates.

Additionally, Roach said he is in Harare to secure export permits, which are critical for scaling up production and distribution, emphasising the company's efforts to reach full capacity and regulatory compliance for exports in the near future.
