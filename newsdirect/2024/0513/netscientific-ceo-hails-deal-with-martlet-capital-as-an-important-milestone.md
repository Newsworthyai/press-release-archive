NetScientific PLC (AIM:NSCI) CEO Dr Ilian Iliev takes Proactive's Stephen Gunnion through a transaction that will see NetScientific company EMV Capital become the investment advisor to Martlet Capital's portfolio of 53 investments while acquiring its operational venture capital business.

Iliev said the transaction is part of NetScientific's strategic goal to become a leading deep tech and life sciences venture capital investor in the UK and Europe, employing a differentiated investment strategy characterised by proactive value creation and capital-light approaches. The deal notably expands NetScientific's assets under management by nearly doubling them with the addition of a £23 million portfolio from Marlet Capital and includes the acquisition of Martlet Capital’s operational team, forming a new entity under NetScientific.

Iliev emphasised the alignment in ethos between NetScientific and Martlet Capital, rooted in long-term relationships and mutual commitment to the sectors. He also highlighted upcoming initiatives, including the launch of new funds aimed at investing in early-stage companies and growth opportunities within the UK, specifically in the Cambridge cluster.
