# Competitive Power Ventures (CPV) Announces Leadership Changes

--News Direct--

The Board of Directors (Board) at Competitive Power Ventures (CPV), a leading developer and operator of highly efficient, low emitting electric generation and renewable power in the United States, shared details of a planned leadership transition.

Effective January 1, 2025, the Board has promoted Sherman Knight, CPV’s President and Chief Commercial Officer, to succeed Gary Lambert as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Lambert, who co-founded CPV 25 years ago, will assume the role of Executive Vice Chairman of the Board.

“Founding and serving as CEO of CPV has been the privilege of a lifetime. I remain committed to the Company and look forward to transitioning into the role of Executive Vice Chairman in January,” said Lambert. “I am confident the success we have built over the last 25 years will continue with Sherman stepping in as CEO. I’ve been fortunate to have worked alongside Sherman for nearly two decades. Throughout that time Sherman has played a major role in our company’s growth and has been a true thought leader at CPV. I am excited for the future of CPV.

“I am grateful and humbled by the opportunity to lead CPV into the future,” said Knight. “I truly appreciate Gary’s vision and leadership over the past 25 years. Under Gary’s direction he’s created a vibrant and enduring company that is helping lead the energy transition in the United States. I want to also extend my gratitude to the Board for its confidence in me to further advance CPV’s strategy.”

Lambert, in his new role as Executive Vice Chairman of the Board, will continue to work alongside Knight and CPV leadership to ensure the company’s continued success.

CPV has added David K. Vickerman to its leadership team, serving as the company’s new Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Vickerman is an industry veteran with a wealth of experience in corporate finance, project financing, and large-scale portfolio growth. His expertise and strategic mindset will help CPV as the company continues to expand its development pipeline and operating portfolio. Paul Buckovich whose tireless efforts and work over the last 23 years with CPV, most recently serving as CFO over the last 10 years, included the execution of some of the most innovative, complex financings for CPV, will assume the role of Executive Vice President of Finance. In this role, Buckovich will continue to lead the CPV’s financing efforts.

The Board announced two additional changes, effective immediately, to CPV’s leadership to ensure a stronger focus on two of the company’s main business segments: Low Carbon Development and Renewables. Peter Podurgiel, currently the Executive Vice President of Project Development, where he oversees CPV’s project development and energy transition strategy of low-carbon operations, was appointed to President of CPV Low Carbon Generation. In the new role, Podurgiel will continue to focus on the development, construction, and operation of new, decarbonized gas-fired generation. Sean Finnerty, currently the Executive Vice President of Renewable Power, was appointed to President of CPV Renewables and will oversee the company’s existing renewable operational assets, strong development pipeline, and renewable construction. Both individuals joined the company shortly after it was founded and have since held various leadership roles helping to position CPV as an industry leader to answer energy market needs and ensure a reliable grid.

“Both Peter and Sean have been part of CPV since just after its inception. Without their hard work, dedication to our mission, and industry expertise we would not have been able to grow the company into what it is today,” said Lambert. “Both are well-deserving of these promotions and will continue to help lead CPV into its next chapter while keeping the essence of who we are at the center.”
