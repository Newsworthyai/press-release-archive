We are currently doing business in 19 states, and we anticipate securing new business from both the private and public sectors. We are excited about our Population Health business unit, which grew over 200% in the first quarter, driven by strong demand for our epidemiology services. Our growth remains strong in our newest business units of Digital Health and Health Education, and we are excited that our Healthcare Workforce business unit has returned to growth in 2024. Syrenity, our mental and behavioral health platform, which is focused on prevention, also holds great promise in terms of revenue for 2024 and beyond. We believe we are at the early stages of accelerating growth, which has been made possible by recent investments in our people and our technology.”
