Lisata Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:LSTA) CEO David Mazzo tells Proactive's Stephen Gunnion that 2024 is a pivotal year for the oncology company, with Phase 2b ASCEND trial top-line data expected in the fourth quarter.

Discussing the company's first-quarter milestones, Mazzo said the results are anticipated to be foundational for the company's future, potentially leading to provisional approval applications in Australia and subsequent discussions with the FDA and EMA.

Mazzo highlighted Lisata's effective cash management, with over $43 million in funds ensuring operations into 2026. The company has achieved several regulatory milestones, including orphan designations for pancreatic cancer and glioma in the EU and US, and a rare pediatric disease designation for osteosarcoma in the US.

Additionally, Mazzo discussed the rapid progress of the BOLSTER trial in cholangiocarcinoma, expected to provide early data points in 2025. The company plans to expand its trials and anticipates potential partnership announcements by year-end, driven by these developments.
