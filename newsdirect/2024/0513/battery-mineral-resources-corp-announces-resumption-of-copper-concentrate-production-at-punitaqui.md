# Battery Mineral Resources Corp. Announces Resumption of Copper Concentrate Production at Punitaqui

--News Direct--

Battery Mineral Resources Corp. (TSXV: BMR) (OTCQB: BTRMF) (“Battery” or “BMR” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the resumption of mill operations and first production of copper concentrates at its Punitaqui project in Chile.

Martin Kostuik, Battery’s CEO stated, "The commencement of copper concentrate production at Punitaqui marks a significant milestone for BMR and in establishing Chile's next copper mine. Having efficiently applied capital, it has paved the way for near term copper production at Punitaqui and positioning the company favorably to generate meaningful cash flow. With the commencement of copper concentrates production, a proficient operational team, and a promising outlook for robust copper markets, we aim to enhance shareholder value further. We eagerly anticipate sharing our progress and results as 2024 progresses."

Operational Highlights 2024

The Company has initiated copper concentrate production after the successful commissioning of the recently refurbished and upgraded mineral processing facility at Punitaqui. Mining activities to establish access to the mineralized zones in both Cinabrio and San Andres continue to ramp up with stockpiling of fresh mill feed. Cinabrio is the original mine that supplied feed for the first 10 years of prior operations, primarily by Glencore plc.

During the ramp up period of the mines, the Company is looking to boost the revenue stream by processing mill feed from external sources. Supply to the mill over the coming months will be a combination of fresh material from the Punitaqui mines and feed from outside sources including material from private mines in the area, and copper smelter slags.

Anglo-American Agreement

The source of slags supply is made possible by the Anglo-American PLC (“Anglo”) agreement announced on February 13th, 2024. Anglo has agreed to purchase all the copper concentrate to be produced from 240,000 tonnes of Anglo-supplied copper smelter slags.

Milestones

The timeline from first fresh mine feed through the mill to reaching planned capacity is expected to require approximately nine months, reaching a run rate of ~90,000 tonnes per month. BMR expects that the Punitaqui full annual copper production rate will be in the range of 19 million to 23 million pounds of copper in concentrate with an operating margin of $35 million to $50 million at current copper prices.

While the Cinabrio and San Andres mines are reaching full production, the Company will continue processing mill feed from outside sources and advancing toward its newly discovered Cinabrio Norte zone, to commence production of mill feed from that zone in H2 2025.

As part of the ongoing operational readiness during 2024, BMR is executing underground infill and extensional drilling at San Andreas and Cinabrio. The drilling program is designed to further define areas that could be included in near-term mine sequencing and for grade control purposes. The company looks forward to reporting the results of this drilling during the course of the year.

Closing of Convertible Debenture Offering

BMR is also pleased to announce that it has closed its US$400,000 (approximately C$549,360) private placement (the “Private Placement”) of senior unsecured convertible debentures (the “Debentures”), which was previously announced on March 11, 2024.

As previously announced, the Debentures will mature on September 30th, 2026 (the “Maturity Date”) and will bear interest at 10% per annum, compounding annually on September 30th of each year, not in advance. Interest accrued from the date of issuance up to and including March 30th, 2025, will be paid by way of issuance of common shares of the Company. Interest accrued following March 30th, 2025, will be, at the option of the holder, paid either in cash or by way of issuance of common shares of the Company. The issuance of common shares as payment of interest will be at the then current market price of the Company’s common shares at the date the interest becomes payable and will be subject to the prior acceptance of the TSX Venture Exchange and applicable securities laws.

The holder of a Debenture may, at their option, at any time preceding the Maturity Date, convert all, but not less than all, of the principal amount of such Debenture into common shares of the Company at the conversion price of US$0.22 per share (approximately C$0.30 per share).

All Debentures issued in the Private Placement and in connection with the debt consolidation are subject to a four month hold period under applicable Canadian securities laws and under the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange. The Debenture issuances are subject to acceptance by the TSX Venture Exchange.
