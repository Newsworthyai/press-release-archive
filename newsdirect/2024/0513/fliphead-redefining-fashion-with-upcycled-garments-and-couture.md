Fliphead's journey began with a simple yet powerful idea: to reimagine fashion by giving new life to discarded materials. Through meticulous craftsmanship and a keen eye for design, Saumya and Mihkel have turned this vision into a reality, creating stunning garments that are both stylish and sustainable.

At the heart of Fliphead's ethos is the concept of upcycling – the process of repurposing old or unused materials into new, high-quality products. By utilizing materials that would otherwise end up in landfills, Fliphead not only minimizes its environmental impact but also adds a unique and eclectic flair to its collections.

One of Fliphead's flagship offerings is its range of festival clothes, which are designed to capture the vibrant spirit of India's diverse cultural celebrations. From colorful saris transformed into flowy dresses to intricately embroidered jackets crafted from vintage textiles, each piece tells a story of creativity and craftsmanship.

In addition to its ready-to-wear collections, Fliphead also offers a couture service that is truly one-of-a-kind. Catering to clients who crave individuality and sustainability, the brand's couture pieces are made exclusively from upcycled materials, ensuring that each garment is as eco-conscious as it is luxurious.

What sets Fliphead apart from other fashion labels is its unwavering commitment to sustainability and ethical practices. From sourcing materials locally to partnering with artisans who share their values, Saumya and Mihkel are dedicated to creating a positive impact on both the environment and the communities they serve.

As consumers become increasingly aware of the environmental and social implications of their purchasing decisions, brands like Fliphead are leading the way towards a more sustainable future for fashion. With their innovative approach and dedication to upcycling, Saumya and Mihkel are not just changing the way we think about clothes – they're changing the industry itself.
