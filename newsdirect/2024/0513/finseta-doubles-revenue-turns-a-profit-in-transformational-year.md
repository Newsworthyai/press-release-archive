# Finseta doubles revenue, turns a profit in transformational year

--News Direct--

Finseta CEO James Hickman tells Proactive's Stephen Gunnion the company experienced a transformative year in 2023 as it doubled of revenue and reported a pretax profit of Â£1.3 million, a significant recovery from a previous loss.

Hickman attributed the improvement to a strategic refocus on enhancing the sales pipeline, expanding the payments network, and refining the product and geographical reach. Key strategic changes included shifting from indirect to direct client interactions, which increased the proportion of revenue from direct clients from 78% in 2022 to 95% in 2023. This shift also resulted in margin improvements and an increase in the average transaction value as the company began serving not only small businesses but also medium-sized businesses and high-net-worth individuals.

The company also underwent a rebranding from Cornerstone PLC to Finseta, aimed at differentiating itself in a crowded market and reflecting its evolved business strategy and ethos.

Furthermore, Finseta expanded its international presence, partnering with best-of-breed payment companies and banks to enhance its service offerings globally. Noteworthy developments included a new corporate card scheme with Mastercard and the approval to provide payment services in Canada, emphasizing Finseta's commitment to geographical and service expansion in its operations.
