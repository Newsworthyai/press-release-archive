Airport security delays and operational disruptions are becoming an increasingly common headache for travelers around the globe, often leading to missed flights and mounting frustrations.

A recent incident at Birmingham Airport vividly illustrates this growing problem. Lucy Kenneally and her boyfriend Matthew experienced the chaos firsthand when they endured a staggering four-hour wait in the security line and ultimately missed their flight.1

Days later, Gatwick Airport faced significant delays after a fire alarm in the South Terminal prompted a full evacuation, causing passengers to be stuck on the runway and leading to a cascading effect of delayed departures.2

Of course, these are just a few examples that highlight a much bigger issue. In reality there are thousands of delayed flights every day across the US and up to 20,000 delays every single day around the world.

The problem has gotten so bad that the Biden administration has developed a new rule to address one of the most pressing travel grievances: flight delays.3

Announced in late April, the rule mandates airlines to provide automatic refunds for delays that disrupt travelers' plans significantly, reflecting a major shift towards enhancing passenger rights.

Another major issue that demands an urgent solution are airport security breaches. According to the US Transportation Security Administration (TSA), there have been at least 300 instances of people bypassing parts of airport security in the last year.4

These security concerns are coming to light at a time when the TSA is working to solve airport security issues by upgrading checkpoints with more advanced technology developed by AI security company Liberty Defense Holdings (TSXV:SCAN) (OTCQB:LDDFF).

Liberty Defense specializes in advanced security solutions tailored for areas with high pedestrian traffic and heightened security needs, including airports, stadiums, and educational institutions. The company's flagship product, HEXWAVE, licensed from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), offers discreet, scalable protection that detects both metallic and non-metallic weapons.

Revolutionizing Airport Security with Advanced TechnologyLiberty Defense Holdings (TSXV:SCAN) (OTCQB:LDDFF) has successfully deployed HEXWAVE across various market verticals and signed several large contracts with airports around the globe. The company also inked a $3.8 million contract with the TSA for its High-Definition Advanced Imaging Technology (HD-AIT) Wideband Upgrade Kit to improve detection capabilities and enhance the passenger experience.

On May 13, Liberty Defense announced that its HEXWAVE system has been selected by the Frederick Douglass Greater Rochester International Airport (ROC) to enhance the TSA’s Aviation Worker Security Screening. ROC, a vital transportation hub serving about 2.4 million passengers annually with 120 daily flights, is now the first U.S. airport to integrate HEXWAVE into its security operations. This deployment marks a notable step in using advanced technology to bolster airport security and operational efficiency.

“As industry leaders, we are excited to be the first airport in the United States to acquire the HEXWAVE system to use in our broader airport security program,” said Deputy Director at the Frederick Douglass Greater Rochester International Airport Andrew Moore. “We will use the HEXWAVE to provide enhanced security and an improved screening experience in non-traditional areas of the airport. We are excited to work with Liberty Defense as we are continually looking to innovate and improve the overall safety of our airport.”

Unlike traditional weapon detection technologies, HEXWAVE utilizes millimeter wave technology, advanced 3D imaging, and AI to detect a wide range of concealed metallic and non-metallic threats—including liquid, powder and plastic explosives, and 3D printed ghost guns—without requiring passengers to remove common items like belts and shoes. This capability allows for a faster, more seamless screening process, enhancing the flow of traffic and reducing bottlenecks at security checkpoints.

Liberty Defense is also expanding into international markets, announcing a recent shipment of its HEXWAVE™ system to Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands and Subic Bay Airport in the Philippines.
