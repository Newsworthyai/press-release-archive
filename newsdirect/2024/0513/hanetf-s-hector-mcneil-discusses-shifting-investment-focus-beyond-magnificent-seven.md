# HANetf's Hector McNeil discusses shifting investment focus beyond 'Magnificent Seven'

--News Direct--

HANetf co-founder and co-CEO Hector McNeil suggests a strategic shift in investment from dominant tech stocks to broader tech themes.

In an interview with Proactive's Stephen Gunnion, McNeil advocated diversifying away from the 'Magnificent Seven,' big tech firms, due to their high PE ratios and concentration risks. He highlights the potential of broader tech investments, particularly through ETFs that offer diversified exposure across various tech sub-sectors, including robotics, cybersecurity, and digital entertainment.

McNeil emphasised the benefits of equal-weighted ETFs, such as the HAN-GINS Tech Megatrend Equal Weighted UCITS ETF (ITEK) which ensures no single stock dominates the index, providing a balanced investment approach. Additionally, he explored opportunities outside the traditional tech sector, particularly in emerging markets.

McNeil underscored the growth potential in the e-commerce sector within these markets, driven by high growth rates and an absence of state-owned enterprises. He pointed out specific ETFs like the EMQQ Emerging Markets Internet & Ecommerce UCITS ETF (EMQQ), which focuses on major market e-commerce, and discussed the significant gains of companies like Pinduoduo and Tencent.

McNeil also mentioned the Future Defense UCITS ETF (NATO), which has gained traction by capitalising on the rising importance of cybersecurity in global defence strategies.
