* Module 2 – “Tax and Immigration Planning”
* Module 3 – “Investments, Retirement, and Other Planning Considerations”

The course curriculum, developed through a strategic partnership with the Global Financial Planning Institute, outlines how ongoing uncertainty in various political, regulatory, and economic environments has led many affluent clients and their families around the world to consider ‘diversification’ not only in terms of their investments — but also in where they live and conduct business so that they may protect their lifestyles and preserve wealth for future generations. It is eligible for 15 hours of CE credit, including 5 hours of tax & regulations CE, for CIMA®, CPWA®, and RMA® certifications (also eligible for 15 CFP® CE credits).

Advice and Planning – This new, concise yet comprehensive microcourse is tailored for advisors and financial professionals seeking to deepen their understanding of advice and planning, which is rooted in two fundamental tenets:

* The financial planning process is most effective in a trust-based, advisor-client relationship.
* The financial planning process is both sequential and recursive.

This course covers the four-step financial planning process and touches upon the concept of advice engagement — highlighting strategies for fostering more meaningful client conversations and delivering advice in a more effective manner. Through a blend of theoretical frameworks, practical insights, and interactive exercises, this course is designed to help advisors navigate the complexities of financial planning with confidence, integrity, and a client-centric focus. It is eligible for 1 hour of CE credit for CIMA®, CPWA®, and RMA® certifications (also eligible for 1 CFP® CE credit).

ENHANCED OFFERING

Private Markets for Advisors – This certificate program provides advisors with the knowledge, skills, and capabilities to enhance portfolio-return potential through private market exposure, and it is designed for professionals who wish to learn valuable best practices to implement alternative strategies into their practice. It breaks down the various strategies and provides guidance on the role of private market investments in diversified portfolios.

This program was originally developed as a 12-hour certificate course but has just been enhanced to include an additional 3 hours of new content that incorporates insights and best practices from a Q4 2023 research study, Adapting to Growing Private Markets: A Playbook for Practice Success, conducted by Cerulli, in collaboration with Invesco and the Institute.

The research highlights the potential benefits for financial advisors in offering private markets investments. Despite recognition of the importance of diversification and growing demand for private market exposure, many advisors allocate only a small portion of client portfolios to alternative investments due to challenges such as lack of liquidity, client education needs, and product complexity. The study suggests a need for enhanced education and support, particularly focusing on communication, coordination, and resources for advisors to better understand and articulate the benefits of private markets to their clients. The research draws insights from a comprehensive survey of 200+ advisors, primarily those holding certifications from the Institute, and provides guidance for practice success in navigating the complexities of alternative investments.

The certificate course is eligible for 15 hours of CE credit for CIMA®, CPWA®, and RMA® certifications (also eligible for 15 CFP® CE credits).
