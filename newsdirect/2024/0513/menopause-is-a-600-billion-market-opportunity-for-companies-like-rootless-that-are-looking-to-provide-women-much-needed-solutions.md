In the past few years, women’s health has been brought to the foreground, and many women are turning to more natural approaches to feel like their best selves. From cycle syncing to eating certain herbal remedies to even transitioning away from hormonal birth control, there seems to be a cultural shift of women embracing more natural remedies to support their overall wellness.

Doctors have witnessed a slow decline in prescription requests, with a 9% decrease in oral contraceptive use between 2002 and 2017. However, notably, Gen Z has taken to social media to express their dissatisfaction with Big Pharma and concerns over the side effects of hormonal drugs. This isn’t to say that only younger women are developing a deeper awareness of different approaches to wellness. Herbal medicine has been shown to help women from menstruation to menopause and beyond.

Historically, women’s health issues like menopause have often been relegated to the sidelines – many women were expected to suffer in silence – but today, education around menopause is growing, which has created an estimated $600 billion opportunity in treating women experiencing menopause for companies willing to provide solutions to half of the population.

This Seaweed Company Is Reshaping How We Approach Women’s HealthRootless is a company dedicated to revolutionizing aspects of the global food system, with a particular focus on women's health. Founded by Sachi Singh, a passionate advocate of seaweed, this company is on a mission to make the health benefits of seaweed accessible to all. Recognizing the transformative power of this superfood, Rootless aims to create products that not only enhance individual health but also contribute positively to the planet and communities.

Sachi's personal health journey has played a significant role in shaping the vision of Rootless. Having struggled with hormonal acne and various hormonal disorders since her early teens, like so many other women, she discovered that treating the root cause of these issues was more effective than simply addressing the symptoms. She has pursued this passion to create a business model that intersects women’s health and the environment.

Rootless's flagship product, The Daily Bites, supports hormone health in menopause and beyond with over 40 macro and micronutrients in a whole-food snackable supplement, including vitamins, minerals, and unique bioactives.

Rootless goes beyond individual health to attempting to address the well-being of the planet. The company sources its seaweed from the Atlantic Ocean off the coasts of Maine and Ireland and says it meets rigorous quality standards. The seaweed is sustainably harvested, providing livelihoods to coastal communities while simultaneously helping to heal the surrounding ocean environment by absorbing carbon. By sourcing their seaweed sustainably and supporting coastal communities, Rootless not only aims to help women navigate their health but also contributes to the healing of our planet.

In a consumer trial where women ate one of the company’s Daily Bites every day for four weeks, 86% experienced higher energy and/or improved metabolism and 83% experienced less bloating and/or constipation, while 97% experienced less hormonal acne and/or dryness. For women experiencing these and other health issues, products like these can provide some relief. Rootless is currently hosting a raise to assist with increasing the company’s presence and support more women worldwide.
