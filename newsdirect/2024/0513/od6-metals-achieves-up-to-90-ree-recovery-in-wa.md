# OD6 Metals achieves up to 90% REE recovery in WA

--News Direct--

OD6 Metals Ltd (ASX:OD6) managing director Brett Hazelden joins Proactive’s Jonathan Jackson to talk through significant progress at its Splinter Rock Rare Earth Elements (REE) Project in Western Australia. Phase 3 testing at the Australian Nuclear Science Organisation (ANSTO) achieved metallurgical recoveries up to 90% of magnet REEs (MREE) in multiple prospect areas. Hazelden highlights the project's comparability to prominent Brazilian clay-hosted rare earth sites, asserting Splinter Rock's status as Australia’s leading clay-hosted rare earth deposit. The project yielded average recoveries around 60% MREE using 25g/l hydrochloric acid, with recoveries varying from 42% to 90% at the Centre Prospect, 44% to 76% at Inside Centre Prospect and 41% to 77% at Prop Prospect. These outcomes underline the potential economic viability of the project, driven by factors like low stripping ratios and acid consumption. 71 samples were selected across diverse clays, locations and depths to enhance the geometallurgical understanding of recovery across different regolith types. The samples varied in REE grades, chemical compositions, and geological settings, aiding in a comprehensive analysis of the deposit. Further, Hazelden emphasises the strategic advantages of the project's location, including no private royalties, proximity to renewable energy sources and the major port of Esperance. The next steps include phase 4 metallurgical leaching and processing optimisation, with a planned mineral resource estimate update later this quarter.
