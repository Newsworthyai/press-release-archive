# Jonathan’s Baker 'Fate The Movie' Plays Homage To Quentin Tarantino’s Vista Movie Theater

“Nothing happens by accident” - Jonathan Baker.

Jonathan Baker is a visionary director who is celebrated for his unparalleled filmmaking techniques. He is known for his hands-on approach, a keen eye for details and crafting compelling narratives that resonate deeply with audiences. His ability to immerse himself in every aspect of production ensures that his creative vision is flawlessly translated from the script to the screen.

One of Baker’s biggest inspirations is visionary filmmaker, Quentin Tarantino for his innovative filmmaking approach. In his second to last directorial venture “Fate”, Baker is paying homage to Tarantino’s Vista Theater through the film's main location, The Vista Hotel and the casting of Harvey Keitel. Keitel, an esteemed actor who brings a commanding presence and depth to his character, enriching the film’s atmosphere and working to elevate the performance of the entire cast.

The Vista Hotel becomes more than a location, but a central character.

"The Vista Hotel was born out of Quentin Tarantino's visionary movie theater," says Baker. "It serves as a creative through-line, connecting the past with the present and infusing our film with a sense of nostalgia just as Harvey Keitel did”.

Keitel's connection to both Baker and Tarantino adds a layer of authenticity to "Fate The Movie”.
