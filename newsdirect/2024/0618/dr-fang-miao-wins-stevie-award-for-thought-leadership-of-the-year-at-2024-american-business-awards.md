Dr. Fang Miao, an author, educator, philanthropist, composer, and spiritual growth mentor, is dedicated to nurturing social practitioners, young leaders, and entrepreneurs. During her acceptance speech and subsequent media interviews, Dr. Fang Miao urged society to embrace the vital responsibility of empowering women with self-awareness and wisdom for personal growth. She passionately asserted that every woman has the potential to become a leader and radiate her own unique brilliance.

In the world, women are often seen as vulnerable, and many have suffered discrimination and oppression because of this perception. However, in the natural world, women are the most powerful nurturers, capable of ensuring the continuation of all living beings. They are also the greatest carriers of legacy. We, as a global human community, should set aside biases, open our hearts, and cease attacking one another in order to collectively build a harmonious and beautiful world.

"Changing the human condition, speaking up for women." The Association for the Protection of Asian Women in America will continue to assist society as a whole and all women in breaking free from constraints, stepping into the light, and growing in a world filled with love. Living with the radiance of the sun.

By fostering environments where women can thrive, we contribute to the prosperity and advancement of society. Together, we can dismantle barriers and create a world where every woman is free to pursue her dreams and shine in her own right.

Spiritual growth is the best protection for oneself. Let us stand united, with compassion and determination, to forge a future where respect and love prevail.
