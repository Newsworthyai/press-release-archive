# Daily Mail Unveils New Global Video Strategy and Commercial Opportunities

Today, Daily Mail launches an innovative video offering, including a slate of premium content and original video franchises to roll out on YouTube and other major video platforms. Over the next year, content ranging from 15 to 30 minutes will reflect Daily Mail’s award-winning editorial coverage of entertainment, news, sports, true crime, and royals.

Coinciding with the launch of new premium shows, the publisher is giving advertising partners unprecedented access to its global production and authoritative editorial talent, through Daily Mail’s “Global Video Studio”. The new commercial offering enables brands to seamlessly integrate and align themselves with key cultural moments and conversations. The studio will be accessed via global commercial sales teams, leveraging the ‘seriously popular’ editorial video franchises across shows, social and shopping, via a complete 360 approach.

Daily Mail currently has more than 20 shows in development. These include ‘Price of Fame,’ which breaks down the surprising details of exactly how expensive life becomes when you’re famous, ‘Your Body on Sport’ that goes deep into the physiology that governs professional athletics, ‘Expert by Decade,’ where three people who held the same job at three different times in history explain how that profession has changed, and more. All these titles will launch over the next six months, with the Global Video Studio seamlessly integrating brands in an authentic and engaging way for consumers.

Tony Manfred, Global Head of Video, Daily Mail said: “People are obsessed with video, and publishers are extremely well positioned to create and distribute that video across phones, computers and connected TV, on a global scale. As master storytellers and content creators, with a huge breadth of quality content expertise and capabilities, we are incredibly excited about and committed to becoming the world’s most popular video publisher. We’ve built a team to produce a huge variety of repeatable, identifiable, and premium quality shows, to engage millions of views on YouTube and across our distributed platforms, reaching more valuable audiences than ever before, wherever they’re consuming content. ”

The launch of the new offering builds upon the tremendous success of Daily Mail’s video strategy to date. Currently, Daily Mail is the largest publisher on TikTok with more than 13 million followers and one billion monthly views, as well as delivering over 125 million monthly views on YouTube. The new premium series will amplify the publisher’s current video output and remarkable pace of short and long form video content creation.

Dominic Williams, Chief Revenue Officer, Mail Metro Media said: “As growth in video consumption continues, we’ve adapted to give our global audiences access to the most captivating stories, and now advertisers have access to our premium video production capabilities. We’ve already seen huge audience growth across social platforms and have the media ecosystem to support this brand-new proposition, engaging younger and more diverse, as well as existing loyal audiences, with the Daily Mail brand.”

Hannah Buitekant, Managing Director - Digital, Mail Metro Media said: “At Daily Mail, we excel in crafting captivating content across all formats. From our rich legacy in written words to our cutting-edge audio and video productions, we deliver compelling omnichannel experiences. This expertise allows advertisers to connect with highly relevant and engaged audiences through innovative strategies.
