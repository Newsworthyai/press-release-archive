Handlery Hotels, California’s oldest family-owned and operated hotel company, is shining a light on San Francisco neighborhoods with their Summer Lights celebration from June through August. Beginning June 15, the Handlery Union Square Hotel will kick off the celebration by lighting up the hotel with new dynamic streaming lights. Part of a complete refurbishing of the exterior façade, the lights brighten up the Union Square area as it continues to make a comeback. “We had the bright idea that we should support the City’s efforts to help neighborhoods in San Francisco continue positive steps for the benefit of the residents and our visitors,” said Jack Handlery, General Manager of the hotel. To recognize Pride month, the Handlery Family is donating $10,000 to SF LGBT Center in the Castro neighborhood. Come July, the family will donate another $10,000 to the Salvation Army’s Kroc Center in the Tenderloin. To wrap up the summer, a final $10,000 will be given to the Booker T. Washington Community Service Center.

“We’re hoping this inspires others to give back to San Francisco’s neighborhoods and support the City by the Bay as it returns to its beauty,” remarked Jack Handlery.
