The 2024 Teacher of the Year Contest began with an open call for nominations, inviting individuals from across the country to share stories of their favorite teachers and how these educators have positively influenced their lives or the lives of their children. More than 388 teachers were nominated, each deserving recognition for their exceptional dedication. After a public vote period, the five winning teachers were chosen.

"We are honored to recognize these exceptional teachers who have gone above and beyond to shape the lives of their students," said Brenda Christmon, senior director of brand communications at Rack Room Shoes. "Their dedication, passion, and commitment to education inspire us all. Through this contest, we aim to celebrate their remarkable achievements."

In previous years of the contest, the schools in need of technology used their grants to buy iPads for classrooms, podcast equipment, Apple TVs, Smartboards, STEM teaching support materials, and even equipped an entire special needs classroom with new desks. The Teacher of the Year Contest is a testament to Rack Room Shoes' commitment to making an impact in the communities we serve.
