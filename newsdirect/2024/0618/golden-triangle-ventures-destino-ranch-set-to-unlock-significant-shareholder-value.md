# Golden Triangle Ventures’ ‘Destino Ranch’ Set To Unlock Significant Shareholder Value

The leisure and recreational industry seems poised for a stellar recovery after bearing the brunt of the COVID-19 outbreak, which caused sector revenue to decline substantially.

That recovery is evident by the fact that the Invesco Leisure and Entertainment ETF (NYSEARCA:PEJ) is up over 27% over the past six months alone compared to the S&P 500, which is up only 21.7% over the same timeframe.

According to The Business Research Company, the arts, entertainment, and recreation sector had a combined annual revenue of about $265 billion in the US alone but is highly fragmented, creating highly profitable opportunities for companies like Golden Triangle Ventures, Inc (OTC:GTVH).

Golden Triangle Ventures, Inc (OTC:GTVH) is a multifaceted consulting company pursuing opportunities in the Health, Entertainment and Technology sectors. It also has other additional projects under development that will provide synergistic value to these divisions. Essentially, GTVH seeks to purchase, acquire, and/or joint venture with established entities that management can help assist and develop into unique opportunities.

In order to capitalize on the burgeoning opportunity in the leisure and recreational sector, GTVH recently announced a number of exciting corporate developments.

First, Lavish Entertainment, GTVH’s wholly owned subsidiary, has developed a comprehensive four-pillar business model that will be a critical component in advancing its mission to create an industry leading entertainment business.

For some background, Lavish Entertainment is a Las Vegas-based company that began operations back in 2017 with a vision of becoming nationally recognized in concert production. It has successfully organized some of the most exciting electronic dance music concerts in Las Vegas.

Lavish Entertainment’s new model encompasses the following key foundational elements: logistics, staffing, equipment, and production. These pillars were meticulously identified and organized to complement each other and ensure seamless operations across all facets of the company.

Second, and what has been getting investors most excited about the company, is that GTVH recently announced the execution of an agreement to acquire approximately 70 acres of prime and improved land for its Destino Ranch (www.DestinoRanch.com) project, a flagship venture under its entertainment division.

Located strategically in Arizona, this achievement marks a significant milestone for Golden Triangle Ventures. The Destino Ranch project is planned as a multifaceted destination center set to redefine entertainment and hospitality in the region while being sustainable.

Ultimately, it will be a destination where nature and technology combine to create unforgettable experiences.

Destino Ranch intends to become an international destination that rivals Coachella and other well-known festival sites. With access to nearly 22,000 visitors traveling through the area per day, the location offers an appealing opportunity to become a modern art and music festival mecca.

Destino will complement the beautiful natural attributes of the Mojave Desert with an immersive, world-class art installation gallery with rotating exhibits, and a large-scale music venue with state-of-the-art staging and production.

As you can see below, Destino is uniquely located on the highly traveled State Route 93 artery between Las Vegas and Phoenix, which is why it would be so compelling for even organizers.

The significantly improved property currently includes perimeter fencing, graded roads, solar power systems, large permanent structures, multiple garden areas with nutrient-rich organic soil, a well, a septic system, complete irrigation systems for all the trees, security cameras, and heavy equipment for upkeep and development.

These upgrades represent a substantial investment totaling nearly $6 million, which has turned this once-vacant land into a beautiful oasis that provides the initial infrastructure needed to begin the development of Destino Ranch.

Steffan Dalsgaard, CEO of Golden Triangle Ventures, stated, "This marks a significant step forward in our vision to create a one-of-a-kind destination that celebrates art, music, and entertainment year-round. Our entire team is beyond confident in our ability to bring this project to life, and our plan is coming closer to reality every day."

Just to put the opportunity here in better context, consider this:

Billboard reports that Coachella earned more than $114 million in profits in 2017, the first reoccurring festival to break the $100 million mark in a single year.

Although that amount is still slightly below the highest-grossing festival of all time—2016's two-weekend Desert Trip, which earned more than $160 million — Coachella has again claimed the top spot among profitable reoccurring festivals, a distinction it has earned each year since 2011.

And as the festival's popularity has grown, so has its profit — seven-fold since 2007. In 2007, Coachella earned $16 million when it was still a one-weekend deal. After moving the celebration to two weekends in 2012, the festival earned $47.3 million.

At the moment, GTVH has a market capitalization of about $4 million, which implies that even if it only manages to capture 10% of Coachella’s market share, it would be able to unlock substantial shareholder value.

Golden Triangle Ventures is actively working to prepare a series of internal production events and will secure bookings for showcasing beginning in Q4 of 2024, further solidifying Destino Ranch's position as a premier entertainment destination.

This project is one of Lavish’s largest undertakings and will be managed by GTVH’s newest acquisition, ABI Create, a premier event management and production firm. ABI will maximize the integrated synergy of the four pillars to amplify the development of Destino Ranch and will utilize the project to showcase the newly formed strategic model.

ABI Create (www.ABICreate.com) was founded in 2015 by Marco Antonio Moreno, who was recently appointed as the new president and COO of Lavish Entertainment. ABI has delivered high-quality productions for a range of large-scale installations at major music festivals, sporting events, and conventions across the United States.

Notable projects include collaborations with the NFL Super Bowl, San Diego and New York Comic Con, EDC and Camp EDC, Bonnaroo Music Festival, the Waste Management Phoenix Open, Arnold Palmer Invitational, Burning Man, and many more.

For investors who may still be wondering whether this is the right time to get back into leisure and recreational stocks, MSGE’s recent earnings calls reaffirm the outlook of the broader industry.

For instance, in the recently reported 2Q24 results, MSGE brought in $403 million, beating consensus expectations of $385 million. This strong growth was attributed to an increase in the number of concerts held at the company’s venue compared to the similar period last year and higher per-event revenues.

Management noted that compared to 2Q23 concert bookings for 1H25 at the Garden were ahead by a fairly strong double-digit percentage, and it appears this trend would persist even when looking farther ahead into FY25.

In addition to that, the company revealed that four of its venues were on track to exceed initial expectations for concerts this year, and that includes ‘The Garden', where the company is on track to set a new record for the number of concert bookings on a full year basis. And in Q3, the company hosted more than 1.5 million guests at over 200 live events across its portfolio of venues.

More importantly, GTVH has reaffirmed its dedication to continuously enhancing shareholder value as the company scales its operations.

That is why the company recently announced a pivotal agreement with T&K Zarro, LLC, managed by Tom Zarro, T&K Zarro president and the largest note holder in GTVH. Under this landmark agreement, T&K Zarro, LLC has committed to a structured and disciplined sale of GTVH stock, limiting sales to no more than 10% of the daily trading volume on any given day.

Additionally, T&K Zarro has agreed to a 6-month moratorium on all interest accruals within its convertible debentures held in GTVH. This moratorium period is designed to provide GTVH with the necessary time to optimize its operations and capitalize on growth opportunities.
