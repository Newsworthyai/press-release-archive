# UNOS unveils new artwork honoring organ donors and recipients

--News Direct--

Today, the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) installed a mural by acclaimed artist Hamilton Glass to recognize the far-reaching impact of organ donation and to pay tribute to organ donors. The artwork is a Glass original, designed specifically for UNOS, and lives above the main entrance of UNOS’ headquarters in Richmond, Va.

The mural portrays the interconnectedness of the organ donation and transplant community, with hands symbolizing the gesture of giving and receiving the gift of life. The blue ripples illustrate the ripple effect of donation on families and communities.

“The artwork serves as a poignant reminder that every donation is a gift that touches us all, creating a network of support that UNOS tirelessly collaborates with daily to save lives,” said Glass.

UNOS invited Richmond-based architect and artist Glass and his wife and business partner Taekia to design and create a piece of art that visually connects to and builds on the meaning of the National Donor Memorial. The memorial honors organ, eye and tissue donors and is open 24/7 to allow visitors to reflect on the journey of donation and transplant.

“The lifesaving and lifechanging impact an organ donor has on both a recipient and their loved ones is incredibly profound, which is why we wanted to work with Hamilton Glass to create a piece of art that honors the selfless gifts organ donors provide,” said Maureen McBride, Ph.D., CEO of UNOS. “We want people to visit this mural and take in and learn how significant and impactful organ donation is.”

Glass uses art to engage the public through big, bold designs and messages of hope, and has more than 300 murals on display throughout Richmond.

The mural is approximately 16 feet tall and 40 feet wide and is comprised of 18 PVC panels. It is located on the exterior of UNOS’ building on North 4th Street in Richmond, Va.
