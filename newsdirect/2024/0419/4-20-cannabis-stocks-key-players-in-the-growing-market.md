# 4/20 Cannabis Stocks: Key Players in the Growing Market

--News Direct--

For those seeking a promising investment opportunity in the cannabis market, Rodedawg International Industries, Inc. (OTC: RWGI)'s progress on its 2024 roadmap is a compelling proposition. The company's strategic approach, coupled with regular updates on its growth and milestones, points to the potential for expansion in the emerging cannabis industry.

As 4/20 approaches, it's a perfect time to check in on cannabis stocks. After years of stagnation, the sector is experiencing a resurgence, thanks to several encouraging factors that have pushed it higher in recent weeks.

For starters, the growing support for legalization among Americans—now at about 88%, according to Pew Research—could make cannabis a key topic in the upcoming U.S. elections. Candidates who support legalization may see a boost in their ratings, which could drive the market even further.

Florida is one state that may soon legalize adult-use cannabis. The Florida Supreme Court has proposed Amendment 3, which, if approved, could take effect in May 2025. There's also speculation about potential cannabis rescheduling by the DEA before the November election, which could further impact the sector.

With all these factors at play, cannabis stocks could see even higher highs. Let's take a look at four potential players in the sector!

Leveraging its experience in customer relationship management (CRM) software, BYND Cannasoft is developing innovative platforms for the medical cannabis industry and wellness technologies tailored for women's health.

The company reported a challenging financial year ending December 31, 2023, with revenue down 4% year-over-year to $1,076,861 and a drastic increase in net loss to $18,495,121, primarily due to impairments.
