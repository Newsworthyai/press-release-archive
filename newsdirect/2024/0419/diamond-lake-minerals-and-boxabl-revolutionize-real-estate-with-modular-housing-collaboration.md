# Diamond Lake Minerals and BOXABL Revolutionize Real Estate with Modular Housing Collaboration

--News Direct--

Diamond Lake Minerals CEO Brian J. Esposito joined Steve Darling from Proactive to unveil the company's long-term real estate vision and its collaboration with modular home building company BOXABL, Inc.

Esposito shed light on BOXABL's impressive journey since its inception in 2017 by the father-son duo Paolo and Galiano Tiramani. BOXABL embarked on research and development, testing, and exploration of alternative building materials and methods conducive to automotive-style mass production of houses.

In 2021, BOXABL secured a federal contract exceeding $9 million to construct and deliver 156 Casitas for a military base, alongside the inauguration of its 170,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Las Vegas, NV. These facilities marked a significant milestone, enabling BOXABL to commence low-volume production and validate the concept, paving the way for the world's most advanced assembly line mass production of housing.

Esposito informed Proactive that DLMI's announcement and partnership with BOXABL mark a pivotal moment in expanding the use case of BOXABL technology. Together, they aim to identify, design, and develop aesthetically pleasing communities known as Boxabl Villages.

The objective is to streamline the construction process and shorten timelines from groundbreaking to residents taking possession of their new homes. Leveraging DLMI's leadership and forward-thinking approach to finance through security tokens, alongside traditional means, opens up additional unique opportunities for these villages to flourish and expand.

As DLMI and Boxabl embark on this collaborative journey, investors can anticipate innovative solutions and transformative advancements in the real estate sector. Stay tuned for further updates as DLMI and BOXABL continue to redefine the future of housing and community development.
