# Comcast Completes Major Fiber Network Expansion in Spring Hill, Kansas

--News Direct--

Comcast announced today the completed expansion of its next-generation Xfinity network to homes and businesses in the City of Spring Hill. The media and technology company invested more than $13 million to install more than 90 miles of new fiber-rich highways that will offer residential broadband speeds faster than 1 gigabit per second (Gbps) and business speeds up to 100 Gbps. The completion is part of Comcast’s ongoing expansion in the Midwest where Comcast is also expanding into Paola/Hillsdale.

“The Kelly-Toland Administration recognizes that building reliable broadband services is essential for healthy communities throughout the state,” Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of Commerce David Toland said. “With the completion of this project, the Spring Hill community now has the resources needed to stay connected and engaged – and help drive economic development.”

"The City of Spring Hill joins Comcast in celebrating the completion of this investment in our community. It will support workforce development, education and greater access to high-speed internet for our residents. This was a big priority of this administration from the start, and I’m glad to see it through to becoming a reality. It also improves our internet infrastructure in a way that is attractive to businesses interested in growing here," said Mayor Joe Berkey, City of Spring Hill. “I am grateful for Comcast’s commitment to expanding broadband access to Spring Hill and also their continued commitment to sponsoring other Spring Hill community events throughout the year.”

“We purchased The Bean in Spring Hill nearly three years ago. The most difficult part of doing business was little to no access to internet and proper speeds needed to run our business,” stated Brad Killen, CEO of The Bean. “When I spoke with Comcast Business it was a quick YES to help us. Before switching to Comcast, our WiFi went out every other day and we were running on the slowest speeds. We are now finally getting normal speeds and could not be happier with the service. Everyday dozens of people work, take meetings, or calls at The Bean and this upgrade keeps people coming back for more.”
