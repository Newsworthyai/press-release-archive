# Justin Sun's Message on HTX’s 11th Anniversary: A Crypto Pioneer’s Unwavering Commitment to User Experience

Singapore, August 9 - HTX, one of the world's leading cryptocurrency exchanges, rolled out the launch ceremony of its 11th-anniversary event series themed "Turning Trials to Triumph" on August 7. The event attracted the attendance of Justin Sun, a member of the HTX Global Advisory Board, along with several renowned crypto influencers. They shared their journeys in the industry and their outlook on HTX's future.

A Company Is Like an Iceberg: What’s Hidden Matters MostThe blockchain industry has come a long way since the Bitcoin whitepaper was published in 2008, marking nearly 16 years of development. For more than two-thirds of this time, HTX has been a key witness and participant in the industry. "People often overlook the achievements that stem from long-term development, fixating instead on short-term events. This is evident in the widespread concerns over price fluctuations, despite the industry's significant progress being undervalued. Over the past 11 years, the growth in the crypto space has far exceeded that of traditional industries. In the crypto world, nothing is impossible, and this statement holds true whether interpreted positively or negatively," said Sun.

HTX has seen strong momentum this year, with trading volumes steadily climbing and the 24-hour volume repeatedly placing the exchange in the top two among centralized exchanges. Additionally, HTX introduced several new products this year, such as Restaking, Trade to Earn, and Earn with Pending Orders, all of which are well-received by users. Reflecting on the experience of the exchange operations, Sun emphasized, "The trading experience is the core of every exchange. At HTX, we focus our time and energy on enhancing user experience to boost trading volume. Moreover, the new assets listed on HTX are cherry-picked. We are committed to offering the best selection of cryptos." Since November 2023, HTX has listed nearly 200 new cryptocurrencies, with 85% achieving a fivefold increase in value.

Sun likened running a company to managing an iceberg, noting that what is visible is just a small part, while the unseen portion is what keeps the iceberg afloat. "Similarly, for a company, the aspects users don't see are crucial, such as security. The regulatory environment is also key; challenges vary at different stages, but excellence is required at every stage."

Enduring Through Bull and Bear Markets: Striving to Be a Time-honoured Crypto PlatformSince his enrollment at the HTX Global Advisory Board, Sun has set the goal for the platform to reclaim its position among the top three exchanges. Given the current progress, HTX is striding on the trajectory toward this goal. To expedite this goal, Sun has laid out three short-term plans: "First, we will continue to enhance HTX's liquidity, not only for BTC and ETH but also for other major coins and newly listed ones. Second, we will keep attracting new users in existing markets. Third, we aim to improve user experience, aspiring to become the exchange with the best user experience in the industry."

Looking further ahead, Sun shared a piece of advice from Alibaba's founder billionaire Jack Ma during a class at Hupan University, which resonates with his vision for HTX: "Not only should we aim to do well, but we should also strive to endure." Sun added, "As Ma pointed out, Japanese companies often have a century-long history, we also yearn for being a centuries-old platform and will always work hard for it, despite the challenges in the financial industry. In the Web3 space, it's rare for a company to last 11 years, but HTX has achieved this milestone. The financial sector is about managing risk, and HTX has successfully navigated multiple bull and bear cycles to reach its 11th anniversary, making it a 'living fossil' in the crypto world."

Brand Value - An Exchange's Moat

The competition among cryptocurrency exchanges is fierce, but Sun believes HTX boasts advantages owing to firm roots. "Brand value is the moat for exchanges, and maintaining long-term customer public praise is crucial. The next level of competition drives every exchange to enhance market depth, trading experience, and regulatory compliance. The current regulatory environment is complex and challenging, but HTX is performing well in this area. Additionally, HTX fosters a closer connection with the community and users than the super large exchanges, an advantage that must be carefully maintained," Sun explained.

This continued commitment to community engagement and brand value has earned HTX a loyal following among its users and friends, many of whom attended this launch. KOL Jianing Yu, one of the participants, noted, "HTX is rooted in longtermism. Successful exchanges in China have thrived by pursuing long-term values. The infrastructure of the Chinese crypto ecosystem remains robust, with platforms like TRON being among the most important globally. The crypto industry still requires a balance between innovation and integrity." Another influencer, J@Crypto, recalled that the smooth trading experience was what initially attracted him to HTX.

As seasoned players in the crypto space, the guests expressed a strong belief in Bitcoin. UNAI YANG shared, "I read the Bitcoin whitepaper five times during my undergraduate years and realized then that witnessing Bitcoin surpassing the dollar would be an extraordinary future." Dr. K also echoed this sentiment, "Bitcoin has been my steadfast companion through the ups and downs."

The guests also shared their insights and advice for investors. Michael advised, "First, don't use leverage; second, only invest money you can afford to lose." Another participant, Yuanzhang, added, "The inability to hold onto coins stems from fear and greed. A larger fund base fosters a patience and stable mindset and so do the idle funds. Longtermism isn't about holding indefinitely but adjusting where you sit. If you view Bitcoin as a ballast, you'll have a better mindset."

Closing ThoughtsOver the past 11 years, HTX has evolved from a cryptocurrency exchange into a comprehensive blockchain business ecosystem, a transformation made possible by the support of its users. In appreciation of users' trust and companionship, HTX officially launched its 11th-anniversary event series at 03:11 on August 8 (UTC), offering rewards exceeding $10 million. Looking ahead, HTX will continue to pursue higher security standards and liquidity, enhance user experience, introduce more diverse products, and remain committed to industry development, aiming to achieve even greater success. As Justin Sun said, HTX is on the way to becoming the centuries-old platform in the crypto space.
