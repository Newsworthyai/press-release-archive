Heart disease is still the single biggest threat to American health today. Family Heart Foundation research shows that less than 5% of Americans are being screened for the most common, life-threatening genetic condition that causes early strokes and heart attacks – elevated Lipoprotein(a) or Lp(a) for short.

Elevated lipoprotein(a) is the most common genetic cause of early heart disease and stroke. One in 5 people worldwide have inherited high Lp(a), and most don’t know it. You inherit your Lp(a) level from your parents. Because elevated Lp(a) isn’t screened for, the first sign of this condition may be a stroke or a heart attack.

Elevated levels of Lp(a) increases the risk of blood clotting and plaque buildup inside the blood vessels, which can block the flow of blood and oxygen to your heart and brain. Compared to the general population, people with elevated Lp(a) have 2-3 times the risk for a heart attack and stroke at a young age. The higher your Lp(a), the higher your risk.

Lp(a) is not measured in the standard cholesterol panel. It’s important to understand if you have elevated Lp(a). Multiple therapies are in development but in the meantime, there are things you can do to manage your other cardiovascular risk factors, such as keeping your LDL cholesterol levels very low. The Family Heart Foundation can help you find a healthcare provider near you and connect you to others living with elevated Lp(a).

The Family Heart Foundation is the only patient-centered, research and advocacy organization focused on addressing the lack of screening and care for people born and living with this common life-threatening condition.

On March 20th a nationwide media tour was conducted featuring Dr. Amit Khera, Professor and Director of Preventive Cardiology UT Southwestern Medical Center and Misty Votaw.

Topics they discussed included:

1. Who should have their Lp(a) measured and when.
2. Misty’s story and how the Family Heart Foundation provided resources.
3. If you have elevated Lp(a), what can you do to reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke.
4. What the Family Heart Foundation is doing to address gaps in care for 60 million Americans at risk.

For more information and to find out if you have elevated Lp(a), contact the Family Heart Foundation’s Care Navigation team at FindLpa.org.
