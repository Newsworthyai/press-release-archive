The Surety & Fidelity Association of America’s (SFAA) board of directors is pleased to announce that, after an extensive search, Ryan C. Work has been named the trade association’s next President & CEO.

“With Ryan’s in-depth trade association management experience and background in developing and managing strategic outreach and policy programs before Congress, the Administration, and various federal and state regulatory agencies, the board is confident in his ability to lead the association successfully,” said Robert Murray, SFAA Board Chairman and Head of Surety, Zurich. “His hands-on experience will allow him to quickly engage on issues impacting the future of the surety and fidelity industry, particularly with key legislative, regulatory and procurement leaders,” continued Murray.

Before joining SFAA, Ryan was Senior Vice President of Government Relations at the Self-Insurance Institute of America (SIIA), where he led advocacy and political activities on self-insurance, stop-loss, and captive insurance issues. Prior to SIIA, Ryan was Senior Director of Government and Regulatory Policy for S&P Global, representing brands including Standard & Poor’s, Platts, J.D. Power, and BusinessWeek.

Ryan has served in several senior staff positions within the U.S. Congress, including as Legislative Director for Cathy McMorris Rodgers (WA), current Chair of the House Energy & Commerce Committee. He previously served as Chief of Staff to Rep. Katherine Harris (FL) and in various staff roles with the U.S. House Committee on Ways & Means and the Office of the Speaker of the House.

“I am honored to be named President and CEO and working to advance SFAA’s value to our members, expanding our advocacy efforts, and building a strong team in support of maintaining SFAA’s reputation as one of the most influential insurance legislative organizations in the states and Washington D.C.,” said Ryan. “I look forward to collaborating with the SFAA Board, Executive Committee, membership and staff to enlist support for issues and programs critical to the industry's success,” added Ryan.

Ryan resides in Alexandria, VA and is a graduate of Penn State University.
