# HTX Liquid Restaking Doubles Reward Pool with Quota Rising to $100M and Launches Reward Boosters

--News Direct--

Since its highly anticipated launch, HTX's Liquid Restaking event has witnessed a surge in participation. In response to this overwhelming interest, HTX has decided to add $50 million to the quota, effectively doubling the event rewards. This enhancement is set to commence on March 25, 2024, at 09:00 (UTC). Concurrently, the exchange will introduce new features to the event to boost participants' rewards by up to 150%.

According to HTX's announcement, with the additional quota, Liquid Restaking is offering a total staking quota of $100 million. This includes 500 BTC, 5,000 ETH, 50,000,000 USDT, 50,000,000 TRX, and 3,000,000,000,000 HTX. You can participate in this event by enabling your assets in Spot and Futures accounts on HTX to get snapshotted and receive initial airdrops daily from premium restaking projects.

Highlights of the event update include:

● Futures accounts are also eligible for participation. You can share corresponding crypto rewards after the platform captures a snapshot of your assets in your Spot account and net equity in your Futures account.

● Boosters. You have the chance to receive up to a 150% boost on your rewards through the following means:

1) Join or create a team.

2) Daily trading fees, including net fees generated from spot, margin, and futures trading. The higher the daily trading fees, the greater your rewards get boosted.

3) $HTX holdings (in Spot and Earn accounts).

These boosts apply to the cryptocurrencies enabled in Liquid Restaking to increase your sharing weight, thereby yielding higher rewards from the event. The three methods mentioned above will grant you different levels of boosts, with particular emphasis on teaming up.

Participants can either join a team or create one by teaming up with friends. A team is eligible to receive a boost, which all team members can enjoy. A team's boost is determined by its level, which is calculated based on the total participating amount contributed by all team members. As the team's level rises, it becomes eligible for a higher boost. Each team can have a maximum of 2,000 members. The team leader, besides benefiting from the team's boost, can receive an extra 20% boost.
