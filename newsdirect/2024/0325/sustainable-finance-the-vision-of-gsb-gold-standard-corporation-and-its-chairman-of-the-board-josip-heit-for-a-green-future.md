Paris, France, March 25, 2024 - (500NewsWire) -- At a time when the call for sustainability is louder than ever, companies around the world are increasingly focussing on green investments and sustainable financial practices. GSB Gold Standard Corporation AG, a leading technology company, is positioning itself at the forefront of this movement.

Josip Heit, recognized successful financial manager and Chairman of the Board of GSB Gold Standard Corporation AG, shared his views and plans regarding sustainable finance in an exclusive interview with "JOURNAL DE BRUXELLES" and explains how they will shape the economy in the future.

JOURNAL DE BRUXELLES, Question: Mr Heit, why is sustainable finance so important to GSB Gold Standard Corporation AG?

Josip Heit: Sustainable finance is not only important, it is essential for the future of our planet and for the long-term health of the global economy.

At GSB Group, together with our licence-affiliated partners, we believe that financial institutions play a key role in promoting sustainable development. Through targeted investments in green technologies and projects that have a positive environmental impact, we can not only mitigate the risk of climate change, but also create new opportunities for growth.

JOURNAL DE BRUXELLES, Q: Mr Heit, can you name some specific measures that your company is taking regarding sustainable finance?

Josip Heit: Well, you can boil it down to a few points, a key area of our commitment to sustainability is the integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria into our investment decisions.

We offer, with the GSB Group, GSPartners and affiliated licence partners, a range of technical solutions specifically designed to promote sustainable developments, including green bonds and funds that invest in renewable energy and sustainable infrastructure and sustainable infrastructure. We are also working on the development of blockchain technologies to improve the transparency and efficiency of sustainable technical transactions.

JOURNAL DE BRUXELLES, Question: What challenges do you see on the way to a more sustainable financial sector?

Josip Heit: One of the most immense challenges is the need to obtain reliable and comparable data on the sustainability performance of companies. Without clear, standardized metrics, it is difficult to assess the true environmental and social impact of investments. Another challenge is to

raising awareness and understanding of the importance of sustainable finance among both investors and consumers. It is about fostering a culture of sustainable investing that goes beyond short-term gains.

JOURNAL DE BRUXELLES, Question: How do you see the future of the economy in terms of sustainable finance?

Josip Heit: I am fully optimistic that sustainable finance will become increasingly mainstream and play a central role in the global economy through the extensive use of technological resources, including artificial intelligence (AI). With the growing awareness of climate change and social inequality, more and more investors are looking for ways to put their money to good use.

The future clearly belongs to companies and projects that offer economic as well as ecological and social value enhancement. In this context, the GSB Group is proud to play a leading role in this movement, and we are determined to continue to find ways in which technical solutions for different segments can contribute to achieving a more sustainable and equitable world.

JOURNAL DE BRUXELLES, in light of this interview with Josip Heit, states matter-of-factly that GSB Gold Standard Corporation Group commitment to sustainable finance through technological solutions clearly demonstrates that the company is not only at the forefront of financial technology, but is also at the forefront of promoting a more sustainable and equitable economy.

The vision and actions of Josip Heit, a proven business leader, and his team are a clear signal that the future of finance is green and that the economy cannot avoid sustainable investment to remain competitive.
