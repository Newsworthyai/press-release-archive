# New Partnerships Could Propell American Aires Inc. To New Heights

--News Direct--

In our modern, technologically driven world, the proliferation of electronic devices emitting electromagnetic fields (EMFs) has raised significant concerns. While these EMFs have undoubtedly improved our lives in terms of convenience and connectivity, they also pose unintended health consequences.

Scientific studies have shown that EMF radiation exposure can lead to brain inflammation, tissue damage, and the development of various diseases, including neurodegenerative conditions. This correlation between brain electrical activity and cognitive function underscores the potential risks of prolonged EMF exposure.

Recognizing these risks, Canadian-based nanotechnology company American Aires Inc. (CSE: WIFI) (OTC: AAIRF) has emerged as a pioneer in addressing the harmful effects of EMF radiation.

American Aires has developed a proprietary silicon-based resonator to protect against EMF radiation. Unlike traditional methods that aim to block or absorb radiation, American Aires' technology modulates EMFs, creating a surrounding area free from their harmful effects.

Over the past 20 years, American Aires has invested at least $20 million in developing its proprietary nanotechnology. This investment has resulted in sleek and stylish devices providing personal and area protection without the need for a power source. These Lifetune products target EMR emitted by various consumer electronic devices, including cellphones, computers, baby monitors, and Wi-Fi, including high-speed 5G networks.

The effectiveness of American Aires' microchip in reducing the harmful effects of EMF radiation has been reaffirmed by the scientific community. A recently published study in the Link Journal confirmed the chip's stabilizing capabilities, supported by eight peer-reviewed studies and 25 clinical and scientific reports, validating the technology.

Financially, American Aires has experienced robust revenue growth, doubling its revenue consistently over the past two years. In the first nine months of 2022 alone, the company generated $5.5 million in revenue, representing a 63% year-over-year increase. With extrapolated growth, American Aires could potentially achieve $10 million in sales in 2023.

Moreover, American Aires boasts superior profit margins, with gross margins averaging about 60%, rivaling top technology companies like Nvidia and Apple. The company reached a significant milestone by achieving positive adjusted EBITDA in its most recent quarter, highlighting its financial strength and growth potential.

The market potential for American Aires' products is substantial, targeting diverse customer segments, including biohackers, tech-savvy athletes, individuals focused on fertility, those seeking better sleep, and gamers. The U.S. market alone could be worth $5 billion, reflecting the immense opportunity for American Aires to capitalize on.

Earlier in the month, American Aires Inc. (CSE: WIFI) (OTC: AAIRF) announced a new alliance with William Morris Endeavor Entertainment (WME), a powerhouse renowned for its influence in the realms of entertainment, sports, and fashion.

WME stands at the forefront of the global entertainment stage, boasting an expansive network of top-tier artists, athletes, and content creators. With a sterling reputation in talent management and strategic marketing, WME's partnership with Aires promises to amplify the brand's presence, extending its reach and engagement while spotlighting the manifold benefits of Aires' wellness and performance optimization solutions.

As a division of Endeavor Group Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: EDR), a dominant force in the sports and entertainment industry, WME's collaboration with Aires holds significant potential. With a majority stake in UFC fighting and WWE Wrestling merger, NYSE:TKO, this venture is primed to leverage the burgeoning interest among elite athletes and performers in Aires' cutting-edge solutions. Building upon the momentum of Aires' acclaimed #airesathlete campaign, this partnership aims to further solidify Aires' standing among top-tier athletes, catalyzing expansion and innovation in this dynamic space.

On March 20, American Aires welcomed Jamie Cochran to its Board of Directors, replacing Ruslan Elensky. Jamie's extensive e-commerce experience and relationships in the health and wellness space align with American Aires' vision for expansion and global impact. His contribution will foster strategic partnerships with trend-setting individuals and businesses, complementing the company's growth trajectory.

Jamie Cochran brings over 15 years of e-commerce experience to the board, having led online ventures to significant success and cumulatively driving sales of approximately $1 billion. His appointment signifies American Aires' commitment to innovation and strategic growth as it continues to lead in EMF protection and human optimization.

American Aires Inc. (CSE: WIFI) (OTC: AAIRF) stands at the forefront of the EMF protection and human optimization industry, offering innovative solutions to address the growing concerns surrounding electromagnetic radiation. As the company welcomes Jamie Cochran to its Board of Directors and expands its reach through initiatives like the #airesathletes campaign and strategic partnerships with industry leaders, it solidifies its position as a pioneer in enhancing human well-being in an increasingly technology-driven world.
