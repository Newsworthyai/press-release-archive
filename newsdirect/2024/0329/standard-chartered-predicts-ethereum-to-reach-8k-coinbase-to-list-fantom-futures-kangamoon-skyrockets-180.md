Standard Chartered has forecasted Ethereum to rise to $8K. Meanwhile, Coinbase has announced that it wants to list Fantom futures. Amid these developments, a new altcoin called KangaMoon (KANG) has surprised the crypto community, skyrocketing 180% during its presale.

KangaMoon (KANG) Price Surge Gives Early Investors 180% ROI KangaMoon (KANG) has soared 180% from the beginning of its presale to its current price of $0.014 in Stage 4. Early supporters are also rejoicing due to the huge return on investment. Crypto analysts have predicted more gains in the coming weeks.

They are foreseeing a potential 100x increase that could push the price of the KANG altcoin to $1. Let us look at the KangaMoon project and what makes it unique. Unlike other meme coins, KangaMoon is taking an innovative approach, blending community engagement and Play-to-Earn (P2E) mechanics.

This project places more attention on its community, offering avenues for them to earn KANG tokens through social media challenges and active participation in shaping its trajectory. This unique SocialFi strategy fosters a strong sense of ownership and fuels sustained growth.

According to KangaMoon's roadmap, the project will be listing its KANG token in Q2 2024. Investors looking for which crypto to buy can avail themselves of this opportunity to join the KangaMoon project before it is launched.

Ethereum (ETH) Price To Reach $8K in 2024Standard Chartered has issued a bullish prediction for Ethereum (ETH), foreseeing a potential surge to $8,000 by the end of 2024 and $14,000 by 2025. In their research note, analysts at the bank attributed this optimistic outlook to the expected approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

They tagged this as a major catalyst for Ethereum's price trajectory. Also, Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered's head of forex and crypto research, mentioned the Decun upgrade as another catalyst for pushing Ethereum's price.

Besides, the upgrade is expected to reduce transaction fees on the blockchain and could attract more developers and users. Standard Chartered's forecast even aligns with other bullish projections for Ethereum. Earlier in January, JPMorgan predicted that Ethereum could reach $5,000 by the end of the year.

Fantom (FTM) Futures To Launch on Coinbase Coinbase International Exchange plans to launch Fantom (FTM) and THORChain perpetual futures trading. The report revealed that trading for FTM-PERP and RUNE-PERP markets is set to commence at 9:30 a.m. UTC on March 28, 2024.

Interestingly, Fantom has reacted positively to the news, displaying a 56.8% price surge on the weekly chart. The altcoin rose from a weekly low of $0.759 to a peak of $1.22. In addition to the weekly gain, Fantom's price has also increased by 200.4% and 146.4% on the monthly and yearly price charts.

The surge in Fantom's price coincides with the forthcoming launch of the Sonic upgrade, which is expected to launch in the spring. This upgrade will mark a major milestone for the Fantom network, promising enhanced innovation and efficiency.

Conclusion Ethereum, KangaMoon, and Fantom are currently riding on bullish sentiment. With the long-awaited crypto bull run on the way, smart investors looking for which crypto to buy can consider KangaMoon, given its low price and meme coin utility. Meme coins are known to produce bullish price gains, and KangaMoon is no exception, as analysts have predicted a 100x rise to $1.
