# New Verticals Catapult Forever Network into ComScore Top 25 US Media Rankings

Fueled by its new verticals for football, baseball and hockey, Forever Network, one of the fastest-growing and most engaged independent sports content brands in the world, announced today that it is now ranked in the Top 25 of ComScore’s US Media outlet rankings. Debuting at No. 24, Forever Network is ranked among media giants like Warner Bros (#1), Walt Disney (#2) and Comcast (#4). The company also marked its entrance on the list as the eighth top sports media company accompanied by sports industry stalwarts like the NBA (No. 3), NFL (No. 7), Barstool Sports (No. 11) and the WWE (No. 15).

“Getting ranked so high by ComScore legitimizes the work we have put in since establishing a North American presence at the beginning of this year,” said Alex Sumsky, CEO and co-founder of Forever Network. “We couldn’t be here without our devoted team and their commitment to user experience, ensuring we are people’s go-to source and have the best content for all things basketball, football, hockey and baseball. This also provides us with a significant benchmark for measuring our success as we continue to establish ourselves as a major player in the US media market.”

Including its first vertical, Basketball Forever, Forever Network has earned 3.6 billion total impressions and 356 million engagements year-to-date across its network of sports social media channels. Football Forever has been the most popular new vertical, garnering 528 million impressions since its start in April. Dugout Forever has earned 198 million impressions since its launch in March and Hockey Forever has earned 282 million since its May launch.

“The popularity we have achieved and growth we have experienced since the start of this year is just the tip of the iceberg,” said Basketball Forever Chief Strategy Officer Nick Kelland. “With plans for our new soccer vertical to debut in July, we estimate that our network of channels will capture more than eight billion impressions before the year ends.”

Forever Network closed a $4 million raise earlier this year to expand in North America and develop new verticals. Along with the new verticals, another key point of the raise was the development of Forever Network’s proprietary free-to-play and real-money games, V.O.A.T., Hot Hands and Streaker, which are on track to launch later this year.
