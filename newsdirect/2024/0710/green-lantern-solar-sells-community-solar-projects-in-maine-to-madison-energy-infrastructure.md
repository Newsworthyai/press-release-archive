to Madison Energy Infrastructure

Green Lantern Solar, an innovative and trusted renewable energy developer, has closed on the sale of two fully permitted community solar projects in Maine to Madison Energy Infrastructure. Both projects, each with a capacity of 975 kilowatts (kW) AC, are under construction and expected to be completed in 2024.

The Mechanic Falls solar project is 1504.2 kW DC located on 7.748 acres in Mechanic Falls, Maine and is expected to produce 1,845,653 kilowatt hours (kWh) annually. The Roosevelt Trail solar project in Windham, Maine, features a system size of 1684.8 kW DC located on 11.24 acres. This project is anticipated to generate 1,930,780 kWh annually.

“We are thrilled to close on the sales of these two fully developed and permitted solar projects to our partner Madison Energy Infrastructure, which we hope are the first of many,” said Scott Buckley, President of Green Lantern Solar. “Our goal is to meticulously prepare the best solar projects in optimum locations to ensure that communities and businesses across our footprint can benefit from the clean energy economy. By leveraging local outreach, our deep real estate, engineering and construction expertise and significant transactional efficiencies cultivated over our 15 years in business, Green Lantern Solar’s projects meet the highest standard for acquisition by long-term owner-operators.”

These acquisitions underscore Green Lantern Solar’s commitment to accelerating the adoption of renewable energy solutions and advancing sustainability efforts in Maine and beyond.

“I’ve long admired Green Lantern Solar’s approach to project development,” said Richard Walsh, CEO at Madison Energy Infrastructure. “Their meticulous site selection and focus on community engagement mirror our own values, and this partnership on these Maine projects is a perfect example. We’re proud to collaborate together to deliver on the promise of clean energy.”

The completion of this transaction marks a significant milestone for Green Lantern Solar and Madison Energy Infrastructure, as they collaborate to deliver on the promise of a green energy future.
