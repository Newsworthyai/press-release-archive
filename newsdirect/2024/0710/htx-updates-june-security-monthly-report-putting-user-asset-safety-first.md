# HTX Updates June Security Monthly Report, Putting User Asset Safety First

HTX, as one of the world's leading exchanges, has always been committed to safeguarding user assets as its highest priority. HTX has been among the first exchanges to adopt "Merkle Tree Proof" to ensure transparency in its asset reserves and has made it routine to release audit reports. Now, HTX publishes its security monthly reports every month and lets data tell the platform's concrete efforts in security.

Previously, HTX reiterated its commitment by placing "prioritizing safety while ensuring no misappropriation of user assets" at the forefront of its industry initiative and promised that users' assets are fully redeemable. Therefore, HTX ensures users are well-informed about their assets, aligning with its "Win Users' Trust" principle. HTX aims to build a safer and more transparent firewall with cutting-edge technologies and strict adherence to the bottom line of safeguarding users' assets.

HTX has released its May Security Monthly Report. See below for the June 2024 Security Monthly Report from HTX, featuring detailed security-related data about the platform.

As part of its security efforts, the exchange has adopted Merkle tree proof of reserves and regularly discloses reserve data. This marks HTX as one of the earliest movers in proving platform reserves. From the end of 2022 to the present, HTX has conducted a total of 21 Merkle tree reserve audits, maintaining a reserve ratio above 100% to ensure that users can safely deposit and fully withdraw assets at any time. Looking ahead, HTX is poised to release its Security Monthly Report every month, implementing more precise data and rigorous financial standards to secure user assets in the long run.
