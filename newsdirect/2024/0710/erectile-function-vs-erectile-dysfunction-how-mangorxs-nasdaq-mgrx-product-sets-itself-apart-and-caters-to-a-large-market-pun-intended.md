Ever since the pandemic, telemedicine has been taking off, and for good reason. It's easy, convenient and increases access for people around the globe. It can also be game-changing for men dealing with what they may consider embarrassing medical conditions like erectile dysfunction. After all, being seen online by a physician enables them to avoid any in-person awkward conversations. Not to mention it can be a lot cheaper and more accessible.

And let's not forget the countless men who may not have a problem getting an erection but who want to enhance their performance and enjoy a prolonged and enhanced experience with their partner. They, too, can benefit from such products but often don’t obtain a prescription because they are embarrassed – such products are no longer only for erectile dysfunction but also for improved erectile function.

Despite the benefits, it's only recently that men-focused healthcare companies have begun popping up online. They are changing the landscape, making it easy for men to seek help for conditions that aren’t life-threatening but can be life-altering, like ED or to simply keep it up for longer.

Mangoceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGRX), which goes by MangoRx, is among them. It is taking the shame out of getting help and getting hard with its telemedicine platform and ED drugs, and is committed to a more accepting and educational approach to men’s health. Patients don’t have to come into an office to get a prescription. Everything is done online and in minutes. Fast delivery means customers are up and performing in no time.

No Shame With MangoRxMangoRx is changing the narrative on ED with its fun and humorous brand voice meant to encourage and empower men to get the help they need. MangoRx uses cheeky humor and quite frankly straightforward language to market towards millions of men to, as they put it, simply have better sex. Taking the shame and awkwardness about common problem, the company is focused on developing, marketing and selling a variety of men’s health and wellness products in the area of ED, hair growth, weight loss and hormone replacement therapies. It leverages a telemedicine platform to discreetly treat its growing base of patients–it's a big market opportunity for MangoRx, especially for the treatment of ED.

ED is a widespread and global problem that is rapidly growing, even among young adults. By the end of 2025 there are forecast to be about 322 million cases of ED. As a result, the market for ED drugs and treatments is projected to grow from $3 billion today to over $7 billion by 2032, representing a CAGR of 9% during the forecast period. Many cases of this treatable condition go undiagnosed, however, because of embarrassment.

MangoRx’s opportunity isn’t only limited to men suffering from ED. The company’s product can also be used as a performance enhancer. With billions of men sexually active around the globe, the performance enhancement market is also a big one for the company.

Drugs like Cialis and Viagra are household names, but there are others on the market that claim to offer benefits over the incumbent. MangoRx says it’s in that category. Its ED pill, Mango, is fast-acting, and the company says very effective. Mango hits the bloodstream in as little as ten minutes and lasts for up to four hours. That gives it a leg up over Viagra, which takes up to 60 minutes to work, and Cialis, which takes about 30 minutes. Treatments start at $12.50 a tablet, making it an affordable option compared to some of its rivals which include Hims & Hers (NYSE: HIMS), Maximus Tribe and Nu Image. Whether you are using it to perform or to enhance the experience, there is no pre-gaming or wining and dining with Mango. Ten minutes after taking the pill, you are ready to go for hours to come.

Viagra And Cialis With A Twist Mango is created using a formula of the same active ingredients in Cialis (Tadalafil) and Viagra (Sildenafil). But instead of using just either of the two substances that have been proven to increase blood flow to the penis alone, Mango adds Oxytocin, the so-called love hormone that helps stimulate feelings of intimacy and L-Arginine, an amino acid that opens blood vessels and helps increase blood flow, to the mix. All four of the substances are FDA-approved and have been on the market for years. The result: a fast-acting pill that lasts for hours. Spontaneity is in with Mango.

Developing a fast-acting ED pill that’s wallet-sized and tastes good is an achievement in itself, but MangoRx makes it easy to obtain the drugs, which is another game changer. Mango requires a prescription, but obtaining it is easy on MangoRx’s telemedicine platform. After completing an online telehealth visit, one of its network of medical providers will review and approve a prescription. MangoRx will ship it in a discreet box to maintain privacy. It's as simple as that, which appeals to its growing customer base. Sales in MangoRx’s first quarter rose 108%.

Whether men need help with ED or want to enhance their sexual experiences, MangoRx makes it easy. The telemedicine platform is quick, easy and discreet. The pills are fast-acting, effective and affordable. With all that to offer, MangoRx seems to be on the way up – like its growing base of clients.
