# FinServ Foundation Welcomes Two Distinguished Leaders to its Board of Directors

FinServ Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to fostering talent in the financial services sector, is delighted to announce the appointment of two esteemed professionals to its board of directors: Bonnie M. Treichel, JD, and Dr. David Rhoiney.

FinServ Foundation specializes in providing coaching, mentorship, and scholarships to empower individuals entering the financial services field. With a focus on industry retention of young professionals through education and professional growth, the foundation actively collaborates with more than 30 colleges and universities, impacting the lives of more than 500 FinServ Fellows. FinServ also covers trips to conferences for these students, sending more than 200 students to conferences in the past year. This initiative broadens their exposure to industry trends while fostering connections that are integral to their future success.

"FinServ Foundation is thrilled to welcome Bonnie and David to our esteemed board,” said Jamie Hopkins, President at FinServ Foundation. “Their combined expertise and passion for empowering people align seamlessly with our mission to nurture the next generation of leaders in financial services. Dr. Rhoiney has been part of FinServ since day one and has given so much, him stepping into a board role just furthers his commitment. Bonnie is someone who I admire in this profession almost as much as anyone. She is one of the brightest minds in our space and I look forward to her partnership.”

Bonnie Treichel is the Founder and Chief Solutions Officer of Endeavor Retirement, a consulting firm dedicated to solving problems for plan sponsors, advisors and service providers in the retirement plan industry. Her experience as an ERISA attorney and advisor helps her bring governance solutions for day-to-day issues that are an inevitable part of running a successful retirement plan.

Ms. Treichel is also a Partner at Endeavor Law, a firm dedicated to supporting the ecosystem of financial services with their retirement plan-related decisions, documentation, compliance, regulation and litigation. She is a thought leader on retirement plan governance issues and has been quoted in The Wall Street Journal, InvestmentNews, 401(k) Specialist, Ignites, PlanAdviser, NAPA Net Daily, and Journal of Pension Benefits. Ms. Treichel is an active member of the American Retirement Association and has served in various leadership roles as well as the Lifetime Income Committee of the Tax Division of the American Bar Association. She was awarded InvestmentNews 40 Under 40 in 2023, the ABA’s On the Rise - Top 40 Young Lawyers Award in 2022.

“I am very excited to join the FinServ Foundation board,” Ms. Treichel said. “FinServ’s focus on mentoring the next generation financial advice professionals will boost these mentees at the beginning of their careers and equip them to help an immense number of clients to achieve their financial goals decades into the future.”

Dr. David Rhoiney is a United States Naval Academy graduate, former two-sport NCAA Division I athlete, applied mathematician, cryptologist, cybersecurity specialist, and robotic general surgeon -- all before the age of 35. Dr. Rhoiney brings an invaluable perspective to the FinServ Advisory Board. Raised in poverty and homelessness as a child, he has achieved professional success. David uses his life experience and talents to help others navigate the complexities of life and achieve their dreams. His life’s mission is to leave a lasting legacy that helps decrease the wealth gap and ease the barriers to a successful life that exist in the United States.

“While I am proud of my success, I know firsthand why so many children born into poverty live in poverty as adults,” Dr. Rhoiney said. “We routinely credit financial success to hard work, but the truth is that millions of people struggling to support themselves and their families with low wage jobs are working very hard. I see the FinServ Foundation as an important way to diversify the ranks of financial professionals in the United States, including overlooked but talented young people who might not even know this path to success exists.”

The addition of Ms. Treichel and Dr. Rhoiney to the board reflects FinServ Foundation's commitment to ensuring a mission-driven and impactful leadership team. Together, they will play a pivotal role in guiding the foundation towards even greater success. They join current advisory board members and leadership team, consisting of Anna N'Jie-Konte, Danny Harvey, Kellan Brown, Brian Money, Michaela Jungbluth, Dr. Craig Lemoine, JaQ Campbell, Dr. Preston Cherry, Kate Healy, Michael Lane, and Jamie Hopkins.
