# Sono Group: Driving the Future with Solar-Powered Commercial Vehicles

Sono Group Managing Director George Oâ€™Leary joined Steve Darling from Proactive to discuss the company's strategic focus on integrating solar technology into commercial vehicles, particularly their flagship product, the Solar Bus Kit. This innovative product underscores the company's commitment to the concept of "solar essence," utilizing efficient, scalable, and low-cost solar photovoltaic (PV) panels. Sono Group's business model is primarily B2B, targeting original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), bus manufacturers, and bus suppliers. Recent funding will sustain the company through June 2025, enabling them to concentrate on enhancing personnel, product development, and maintaining transparency. O'Leary highlighted the company's ambitious vision for the next three to five years, which aims to create a world free from fossil fuels by installing solar technology on all commercial vehicles globally. Sono Group plans to expand its solar solutions across various types of buses, whether diesel or electric. Furthermore, the company intends to move to a major stock exchange to enhance shareholder value, following their recent listing on the OTCQB market. This forward-thinking approach not only aligns with global sustainability goals but also positions Sono Group at the forefront of the solar technology integration in the commercial vehicle sector, driving innovation and fostering a greener future.
