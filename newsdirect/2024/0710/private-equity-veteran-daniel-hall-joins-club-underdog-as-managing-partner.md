# PRIVATE EQUITY VETERAN DANIEL HALL JOINS CLUB UNDERDOG AS MANAGING PARTNER

Club Underdog, a subsidiary of North Sixth Group, today announced private equity industry veteran Daniel Hall has joined as Managing Partner.

Prior to joining Club Underdog, Mr. Hall enjoyed a successful career in finance and legal services, including a decade-long stint as Partner at global private equity firm Ares Management. Most recently, Mr. Hall co-founded Pacific & Plains, an independent alternative credit investment firm. He previously served as General Counsel, Secretary and Chief Legal Officer of Ares Dynamic Credit Allocation Fund (NYSE: ARDC), a publicly traded credit fund. Mr. Hall began his career as an Associate and Senior Associate at law firms Norton Rose Fulbright and Clifford Chance.

“Sports is one of the fastest-growing asset classes, and beyond the financial component, brings a sense of purpose, meaning and community that is important to me at this stage of my career,” said Daniel Hall. “I had the opportunity to invest in Club Underdog’s assets and get a first-hand experience of what was being built behind the scenes and it was inspiring and compelling both from a financial and social standpoint. As I became more acquainted with the vision and the capabilities of the leadership team, I was motivated to get involved as a Managing Partner.”

Other partners in the ownership group include visionary entrepreneur and North Sixth Group CEO Morgan Harris and media and sports founder and executive Matt Rizzetta.

“Welcoming Daniel as a Managing Partner is an important step forward in the vision and evolution of our Club Underdog portfolio,” said Morgan Harris, CEO of North Sixth Group, parent company of Club Underdog. “Having someone of Daniel’s pedigree and financial services acumen combined with our operating track record and skillset in the sports, media and marketing verticals, is a unique combination that few other multi-asset sports ownership groups can claim.”

Under its Club Underdog subsidiary, North Sixth Group has a successful track record achieving sporting and business results for professional soccer clubs and franchises with rich tradition in strategic locations with high upside potential.

Club Underdog is a multi-asset sports ownership entity wholly owned and operated by North Sixth Group, a New York and Los Angeles-based family office operating company.
