# Velocity Global Continues to Expand Global Footprint

Velocity Global, the world’s expert on work, announced today that it has successfully opened new entities in El Salvador and Georgia, allowing customers easy and compliant access to talent in these economies. The new entities will open opportunities for organizations and local talent alike. The company also announced it has obtained a Haken business license in Japan to ensure continued compliant operations in the country.

With a steadily growing economy and strategically located between Europe and Asia, Georgia is an attractive market for growing companies looking to do business in the region. El Salvador offers a favorable business climate with the modernization of foreign trade operations, new physical and digital infrastructure, and a newly implemented legal framework that protects and promotes foreign investment.
