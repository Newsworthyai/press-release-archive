# Direxion Unveils Broadcom and Micron Technologies Single Stock Leveraged and Inverse ETFs

One week after the launch of four additional Single Stock Leveraged and Inverse ETFs, Direxion, a leading provider of tradeable ETFs, today announced bringing two more semiconductor pairs to market. The four new funds allow active traders to obtain magnified, or inverse, exposure to the daily performance of the common stock of Broadcom Inc., or Micron Technologies Inc., through either the Direxion Daily AVGO Bull 2X Shares (Ticker: AVL) and Direxion Daily AVGO Bear 1X Shares (Ticker: AVS), or the Direxion Daily MU Bull 2X Shares (Ticker: MUU) and Direxion Daily MU Bear 1X Shares (Ticker: MUD).

“Direxion is the leader in the semiconductor sector of the leveraged and inverse ETF universe, with over $13B in assets across the suite,” said Direxion Managing Director, Edward Egilinsky. “With the launch of the Broadcom and Micron Technologies ETFs, Direxion now has the largest suite of single stock leveraged and inverse ETFs as well.”

As ground-breaking products built for active traders, Direxion’s pairs of single stock leveraged and inverse ETFs are meant to be used for short-term trading purposes. Leveraged and inverse single stock ETFs should not be viewed as buy and hold investments, but rather trading tools for traders with a high risk tolerance. In addition, unlike traditional ETFs, or even other levered and/or inverse ETFs, these ETFs track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification.

All Direxion leveraged and inverse ETFs are intended only for investors with an in-depth understanding of the risks associated with seeking leveraged investment results, and who plan to actively monitor and manage their positions. There is no guarantee these ETFs will meet their objective. Please visit the Direxion Leveraged and Inverse ETF Education Center, where you will find educational brochures, videos, and a self-paced online course to help you understand if leveraged ETFs are right for you.

Investing in the funds involves a high degree of risk. Unlike traditional ETFs, or even other leveraged and/or inverse ETFs, these leveraged and/or inverse single-stock ETFs track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification. Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying stock’s performance over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments. The Funds will lose money if the underlying stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Bull Fund will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance increases, and the Bear Fund will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance decreases, over a period longer than a single day. Investing in the Funds is not equivalent to investing directly in AVGO or MU.

Semiconductor Industry Risk – Semiconductor companies may face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, and such competition may have an adverse effect on such companies’ profit margins. Semiconductor companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. Companies in the semiconductor industry may have products that face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for qualified personnel.

Broadcom Inc. Investing Risk – Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment held by the Fund to be more volatile than the market generally. The value of an individual security or particular type of security may be more volatile than the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of the market as a whole. As of the date of this prospectus, in addition to the risks associated with operating companies and companies in the semiconductor sector, AVGO faces risks associated with: the highly competitive nature of the semiconductor industry; failure to realize expected benefits from mergers, acquisitions and other joint ventures; economic and market uncertainty; reduced demand for its products; potential concentration of revenues in a few large clients; among other risks.

Micron Technology, Inc. Investing Risk – Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment held by the Fund to be more volatile than the market generally. The value of an individual security or particular type of security may be more volatile than the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of the market as a whole. In addition to the risks associated with companies in the technology sector and semiconductor industry, Micron Technology, Inc. faces risks associated with: volatility in selling prices of its products; the ability to develop and produce new and competitive technologies and products; the highly competitive nature of the semiconductor industry; its international operations, including geopolitical risks; availability and quality of materials, supplies, and capital equipment and dependency on third-party service providers; cybersecurity attacks and data breaches; among other risks.

Direxion Shares Risks – An investment in each Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. Each Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with a Fund concentrating its investments in a particular security, industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. A Fund's investments in derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other investments, including imperfect correlations with underlying investments or the Fund's other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility and lack of availability. As a result, the value of an investment in a Fund may change quickly and without warning. Risks of the Funds include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Derivatives Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Broadcom Inc. or Micron Technology, Inc. Investing Risk, Market Risk, Industry Concentration Risk, Cash Transaction Risk, Indirect Investment Risk, and risks specific to the technology sector and semiconductor industry. Additional risks include, for the Direxion Daily AVGO Bull 2X Shares and Direxion Daily MU Bull 2X Shares, Leverage Risk and Daily Correlation Risk, and for the Direxion Direxion Daily AVGO Bear 1X Shares and Direxion Daily MU Bear 1X Shares, Shorting or Inverse Risk as well as Daily Inverse Correlation Risk. Please see the summary and full prospectuses for a more complete description of these and other risks of the Funds.
