# RevUpX: Innovative Zero-Fee Credit Card Processing Firm Takes Off

RevUp Transactions (RevUpX), a dynamic new player in the merchant services industry, has been shifting into high gear since its summer launch. The company specializes in delivering tailored credit card processing solutions designed to meet the unique needs of underserved auto dealerships.

Founded by industry veteran Joe Doyle, RevUpX offers compliant Zero-Fee Credit Card Processing, enabling dealerships and other merchants to save big on processing fees while providing greater payment flexibility to their customers.

“Auto dealerships have been missing out on significant savings due to a lack of awareness or understanding of zero-fee processing programs," said Doyle.

"We created RevUpX to bridge this gap, offering a simple, compliant solution that allows businesses to retain more revenue while providing a seamless customer experience."

As a Direct Partner of CardConnect and Fiserv Inc., RevUpX leverages the strength of these industry heavyweights in payment processing, bringing unmatched scale and innovation to RevUpX’s offerings.

Doyle, a prominent figure in the merchant services industry with more than 25 years of experience, is the driving force behind RevUpX. After overseeing the acquisition of his previous company, MerchantPro Express, by CardConnect, Doyle founded RevUpX to deliver customized, high-value solutions to the automotive industry.

To bring his vision to life, Doyle assembled a team of seasoned industry veterans who share his passion for innovation and commitment to exceptional client service. “In a complex industry like ours, a proven team is essential,” Doyle explained. His trusted roster includes longtime collaborators with decades of experience and a strong track record of success.

With RevUpX, auto dealerships now have a powerful opportunity to transform their payment systems while significantly cutting costs. It’s a game-changing approach that helps position dealerships to stay competitive in an evolving market, driving long-term growth and success.
