# MedCognetics Introduces the First Embedded AI Cancer Detection System for Mammography Imaging

MedCognetics, Inc., a company focusing on medical imaging AI, today announced the successful testing and implementation of the first embedded AI image processing and cancer detection system for mammography. The system utilizes the NVIDIA IGX OrinTM medical-grade edge AI platform alongside MedCognetics’ advanced AI-enabled software, CogNet AI-MT, which was developed in collaboration with clinical leaders worldwide. CogNet AI-MT has been trained on a diverse global dataset to enhance the performance of radiologists and help improve patient outcomes worldwide.

Incorporating MedCognetics’ new system would allow for AI-driven image enhancement and cancer detection to occur in real-time within the mammography device itself. The embedded solution eliminates latency, delivering immediate, high-quality image analysis, a significant improvement over traditional setups that require external workstations or cloud-based processing. This approach is poised to improve patient outcomes through faster results, enhanced image quality and reduced hardware costs.

“Embedding our CogNet AI-MT software directly into mammography imaging equipment means we can enhance image quality and provide immediate cancer detection without the need for costly hardware upgrades,” said Debasish “Ron” Nag, CEO of MedCognetics. “Using the NVIDIA IGX platform, we’re advancing medical imaging technology, making high-quality diagnostic tools more accessible to radiologists and imaging centers around the world.”

The NVIDIA IGX Orin platform combines enterprise-level hardware, software, and support. It is purpose-built for industrial and medical edge computing. The platform delivers the performance, durability, security, and safety required for advanced AI applications and features programmable safety extensions, commercial OS support, and powerful AI software. These capabilities, equip organizations to confidently deploy AI safely and securely for enhanced human and machine collaboration.

The embedded AI system developed by MedCognetics offers several key benefits:

1. On-Premises Device: Rapid, complete analysis right in the radiology workflow.
2. Enhanced Image Quality: AI-driven enhancements improve the clarity and detail of images without requiring high-end, expensive hardware.
3. Immediate Results: Processing occurs within the device, providing instant analysis and reducing the wait time for results.
4. Cost Efficiency: Medical device manufacturers can achieve high-end image quality at a fraction of the cost by utilizing AI rather than upgrading hardware.
5. Workflow Optimization: Enables worklist prioritization and clinic-determined workflow optimization, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of radiologists and imaging centers.
6. Easy Upgrades and Maintenance: Software-based solutions are easier to update and maintain, helping to ensure that medical imaging equipment remains cutting-edge without frequent hardware replacements.

Earlier this year, MedCognetics was awarded a groundbreaking patent by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for its inclusive, unbiased medical imaging AI technology in mammography. Its expertise in embedded engineering, combined with the NVIDIA IGX platform, is poised to significantly advance medical imaging technology. This work underscores the importance of integrating AI into medical devices to enhance diagnostic capabilities and patient care.
