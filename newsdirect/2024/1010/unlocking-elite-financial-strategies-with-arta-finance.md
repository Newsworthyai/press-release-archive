Digital wealth platform Arta Finance is on a mission to broaden access to sophisticated financial solutions. Traditionally, family-office-style investing was reserved for the ultra-wealthy, but many savvy investors are now realizing that this is no longer the case. Arta offers accredited investors access to elite fund managers and intelligent investment tools in public and private markets. By combining technology and deep financial expertise, Arta aims to empower individuals and families to take control of their financial futures.

Expanding Access To Private InvestmentsArta provides investors with access to high-growth private investment opportunities such as private equity, venture capital, private credit and private real estate – products that were previously considered accessible only to institutional investors or ultra-high-net-worth individuals.

For those looking to diversify beyond stocks and bonds, private investment options can offer low correlation with public markets, potentially reducing risk and improving long-term returns. Arta’s team of experts carefully curates a selection of high-quality funds from leading managers.

Investors can start with minimums as low as $2,500 – which is significantly less than historically typical minimums for private funds – and low fees starting at just 0.5%. This makes it much easier for a wider audience to invest in private markets without many of the hurdles usually associated with this asset class.

It’s easy to get started – it takes just a few minutes to create an account. If you need investment guidance, Arta also has investment experts available to discuss offerings in one-on-one sessions.

Investing In Public MarketsOutside of private investments, Arta offers an array of public market products that give investors exposure to global markets through a selection of ETFs. Leveraging advanced algorithms, Arta manages a range of diversified portfolios that align with each investor’s unique financial goals and risk tolerance.

For example, the company notes that its High Yield Cash Reserve product offers a secure, high-yield cash alternative for investors looking to earn more on their idle cash while maintaining liquidity. Similarly, Arta’s Income Bonds product focuses on providing downside protection and income generation during periods of market volatility.

Arta allows you to choose from a variety of algorithm-driven portfolios to match your goals and risk profile. This combination of high-tech automation and expert curation lets investors take a hands-off approach to growing their wealth.

Tailored Investment SolutionsInvestors looking for more customization might want to consider Arta’s Structured Products. These are bespoke investment opportunities tailored for the current market environment and designed to align with specific financial objectives, such as capital preservation or yield generation. Each product has a limited investment window.

Structured Products include a combination of securities and are crafted with the expertise of Arta’s investment team based on current market trends. They could be an ideal solution for those seeking a specific risk-reward approach in their portfolios.

Personalized Index PortfoliosAnother feature that sets Arta Finance apart is Direct Indexing. Unlike traditional index funds, Direct Indexing allows investors to own individual securities within an index, offering the ability to tailor portfolios to personal values and financial goals. Investors can exclude up to 10 stocks from a given index or even create micro-indexes with up to seven key stocks.

Wealth Management ServicesArta also offers a suite of financial planning tools designed to help you grow and protect your money like the ultra-wealthy. Whether you want to leverage WealthGen Insurance for tax-advantaged growth, hedge your portfolio with options or optimize your tax and estate planning, Arta can help. You can also access personal assistant services to free up time and boost efficiency, all with the same elite level of service previously reserved for the ultra-wealthy.

Gateway To Elite Financial StrategiesMore than just a digital wealth platform, Arta Finance says it offers a gateway to sophisticated investment strategies once reserved for the ultra-wealthy. Whether you want to grow your wealth in private or public markets, or if you are looking for personalized wealth management solutions, Arta uses state-of-the-art technology and investing expertise to broaden access to exclusive investment opportunities and empower investors to take control of their financial futures.
