# The Bermuda Business Development Agency (BDA) Leads Economic Growth as EIRC Initiative Surpasses $500 Million Milestone

October 10, 2024 – The Bermuda Business Development Agency (BDA) is pleased to announce that the Economic Investment Residential Certificate (EIRC) initiative has surpassed $500 million in investments. This milestone reinforces Bermuda’s position as a premier destination for global investors, showcasing the EIRC’s pivotal role in driving sustained economic growth while enhancing the island’s appeal to high-net-worth individuals seeking both exceptional investments and an unmatched island lifestyle.

Since its launch in 2021, The BDA has successfully provided concierge services for all EIRC applicants, guiding them through each phase of the process and ensuring a smooth, seamless experience. This tailored approach has been instrumental in driving economic growth, attracting affluent investors from around the world, including the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Spain. With a minimum investment of $2.5 million, participants gain permanent residency in Bermuda and the flexibility to invest in real estate, new and existing local businesses, Government bonds (previously offered), or social causes. To date, 58 approved applications have driven substantial capital into local enterprises and the property market.

The EIRC does however offer more than financial benefits; many certificate holders are drawn to Bermuda because of personal connections, whether through birth, marriage, or long-standing relationships with the island. As a result, these stakeholders are not solely investing capital—they have become part of Bermuda’s community. Data shows that nearly half of a country’s economic growth typically originates from individuals already embedded in the community, and Bermuda is no different. By becoming part of the island’s fabric, these stakeholders unlock even greater opportunities for investment and growth, driving Bermuda’s continued economic success.

The Honourable Jason Hayward, Minister of Economy and Labour, commented on the programme's success: "The EIRC initiative has proven to be a vital tool for stimulating economic development in Bermuda. By attracting high-net-worth individuals who are not only investing but also establishing Bermuda as their home, we are creating long-term opportunities for the island. Surpassing the $500 million mark is a significant achievement, and we are confident that the BDA and EIRC programme will continue to contribute positively to Bermuda’s economic growth."

Kyle Rogers, Research and Intelligence Manager at the BDA, is also responsible for overseeing the concierge service that supports applicants throughout the entire EIRC process. He ensures seamless management of the certificates, providing crucial guidance from initial inquiry, through comprehensive candidate evaluation, to final approval. He stated, "Reaching $500 million is a testament to Bermuda’s unique offering as both a business hub and an exceptional place to live. The EIRC initiative continues to generate significant value by attracting capital and new residents who are committed to the island’s long-term success. We are excited about the programme’s growth and the bright future ahead."

Of the total $500 million investment, $212 million has been directed towards new businesses, $231 million into real estate, $49 million into existing local enterprises, $2.6 million into Government bonds, and $6 million into social ventures deemed beneficial to Bermuda and subject to the Minister’s approval.

Jonathan Halata, a developer, investor, and successful EIRC applicant, shared his experience: "As Canadians and Brits, my family has been connected to Bermuda since the 1970s. The EIRC wasn’t just about investing money; it was about building a life for my husband and daughter, and contributing to the community my family has become part of."

"My investment in Bermuda extends far beyond financial returns—it's about contributing to the development of premier assets like hotels and tourism infrastructure. Island Realty projects like Azura and Nautilus have brought something unique to Bermuda and created dozens of jobs, which are vital for both airlift and the livelihoods of Bermudians.

"I see a direct link between the EIRC programme and Bermuda’s future growth. It’s not just about selling homes—it’s about creating lasting opportunities. Multiplying our experience by 10, 50, or 100 could generate significant new jobs for Bermudians."

"The EIRC certificate process was much easier than I expected, especially knowing the complexities with immigration and work permits. The BDA’s white-glove service, with Kyle’s personal attention to detail, made a tremendous difference. They delivered exactly what was promised, with a ribbon on top."
