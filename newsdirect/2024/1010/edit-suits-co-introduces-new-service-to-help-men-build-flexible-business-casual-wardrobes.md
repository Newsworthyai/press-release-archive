With the decline of formal dress codes, the traditional suit is no longer a daily necessity. However, this has introduced a new challenge for men: finding coordinated and stylish combinations of jackets, trousers, and shirts. To address this, Edit Suits Co. has developed a service focused on three key principles to ensure every wardrobe remains adaptable and fashionable:

Choose Softer Jacket Fits: To achieve a wardrobe that transitions effortlessly from formal to casual, opt for softer fits with soft shoulders and construction. Structured jackets are typically reserved for formal wear, while softer styles work well in both formal and casual settings.

Select Textured Fabrics: Fabric selection is crucial when wearing separates. Worsted wool, commonly used for formal suits, may seem out of place when worn as separates. Instead, textured fabrics such as high-twist wool, hopsack, linen, flannel, or brushed cotton are ideal for creating versatile and intentional separates.

Opt for Versatile Colours: When building a flexible wardrobe, stick to timeless colours such as blues, greys, browns, and greens. Midnight blue jackets, charcoal trousers, and light beige separates can be easily mixed and matched, ensuring a sharp appearance for any occasion.

To experience the new style advisory service and create a personalised, versatile wardrobe, visit one of the Edit Suits Co. showrooms in London, Birmingham, Manchester, or Leeds.
