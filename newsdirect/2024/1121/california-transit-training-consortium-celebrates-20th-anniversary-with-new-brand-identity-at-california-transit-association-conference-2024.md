# California Transit Training Consortium Celebrates 20th Anniversary with New Brand Identity
at California Transit Association Conference 2024

The California Transit Training Consortium (CTTC) will celebrate its 20th anniversary at the 59th Annual California Transit Association Conference and Expo with the unveiling of a refreshed brand identity. This milestone marks two decades of leadership in transit workforce development and highlights CTTC’s ongoing commitment to empowering California’s public transit professionals through innovative training solutions.

Founded in 2004 by James Ditch, who recognized the need for California’s transit agencies to collaborate on workforce training, CTTC has since become an essential force in the public transit industry. Ditch’s vision of unified efforts to strengthen workforce development remains central to the organization’s mission today. This 20-year milestone reaffirms CTTC’s brand promise, “Mastering Transit Excellence with Innovative Learning.”

Legacy of Impact and a Future of Innovation

Over the past two decades, CTTC has trained thousands of transit professionals with the skills needed to navigate the evolving landscape of public transit, ensuring safety, efficiency, and reliability across California’s systems. The refreshed visual identity honors CTTC’s storied past while looking ahead, positioning the organization to meet the demands of a rapidly changing transit workforce.

“Our new brand honors the legacy that James Ditch built 20 years ago,” said Rashidi Barnes, CTTC marketing committee chair. “It reflects our core values of collaboration, education, and innovation—values that have been at the heart of our success. This rebranding not only refreshes our look but also reaffirms our purpose: to elevate California’s transit workforce through exceptional, forward-thinking training programs.”

The 20th-anniversary celebration and rebranding will be highlighted at the California Transit Association Conference at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center. Attendees will have the opportunity to connect with Maggie Pears, CTTC’s executive director, to learn more about the organization’s future direction. Exclusive branded giveaways will also be available to commemorate the event which can be found at Booth #329 on the expo floor.

Symbolism and Significance of the New Brand

The refreshed brand features a modernized logo that emphasizes collaboration, with the two “T’s” symbolizing mentorship—one person guiding and training another. The updated color palette retains the signature Brand Blue, now paired with vibrant accents to symbolize the energy, innovation, and forward momentum defining CTTC’s future.

“As we celebrate 20 years of CTTC’s leadership in transit training,” said Dr. Yachun Chow, manager of zero-emission truck and bus programs at the California Air Resources Board (CARB), “CARB recognizes the crucial role the organization has played in advancing safety, efficiency, and sustainability in California’s transit systems. As we accelerate the shift to zero-emission fleets, CTTC’s new forward-thinking brand highlights its commitment to preparing the workforce for the challenges and opportunities ahead. Ensuring our transit operators are equipped to support electric and clean energy technologies is vital to meeting California’s climate goals.”
