# COMCAST CELEBRATES 2024 RISE GRANT RECIPIENTS

Yesterday, Comcast brought together more than 100 Comcast RISE recipients, partners, local officials, Comcast leaders and more from across Southern Colorado for Comcast RISE Day: an evening of education, collaboration, networking and recognition.

The Comcast RISE program awarded a total of $500,000 in grants along with technology makeovers, marketing assistance, coaching sessions and education resources to 100 small businesses in Southern Colorado this year. Southern Colorado is one of five communities in the nation chosen for the 2024 program.

“I’m confident that with the marketing assistance and technology makeover, we can more effectively share the type of experience we offer, increase our occupancy, and ensure more happy guests have a RAD Colorado experience,” said Erin Welch, RISE Grantee and Owner of RAD Hostel in Colorado Springs.

Comcast RISE Day was a way to provide ongoing investment and help ensure the long-term success of these small businesses, which are the bedrock of economic growth in their communities.

“Thanks to Comcast RISE, I now have an opportunity for a fresh start, and resources to grow my business.” Said Rique Lucero, RISE grantee and Owner of ColorSplashPaintball in Pueblo, CO.

“Small businesses are the backbone of our communities, and Comcast is dedicated to the success and empowerment of these local businesses in Southern Colorado.” said J.D. Keller, Regional Senior Vice President, Comcast Mountain West Region. “Our mission for Comcast RISE is to ensure these businesses can prosper, thrive, and create a sustainable impact across Colorado.”

Comcast RISE was created in November 2020 to help small businesses hardest hit by COVID-19 by providing the grants and services needed to survive and recover. The program since evolved from helping businesses survive the pandemic, to helping businesses and their communities achieve stronger economic growth.

Held at the United States Olympic and Paralympic Museum in Colorado Springs, the event featured networking, a marketplace offering connections to local resources through Colorado Springs Chamber and EDC, the BBB of Southern Colorado, The Pueblo Economic Development Corp., and the Pikes Peak Small Business Development Center, as well as Comcast Business.

Robert Thompson, Vice President, Comcast Business in the Mountain West Region, emceed the evening, and we were honored to hear from Jonathan Liebert, CEO/Executive Director, Better Business Bureau of Southern Colorado, who discussed how AI can be a power-up for small businesses.
