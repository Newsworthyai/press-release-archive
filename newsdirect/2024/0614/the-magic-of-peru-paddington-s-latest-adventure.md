# The magic of Peru: Paddington's latest adventure

After 6 years, Paddington is back, this time in Peru! The new installment of the world's most famous bear tells the story of his return to his homeland to visit his Aunt Lucy, who now resides at the Home for Retired Bears. Along with the Brown family, he embarks on an exciting adventure through the Amazon rainforest and the mountain peaks of Peru.

"Paddington in Peru'' is a Studio Canal (United Kingdom) production. Directed by Dougal Wilson and based on the English children's story “A Bear Called Paddington” by writer Michael Bond, the first two films were a major success, grossing nearly 500 million dollars.

Director Dougal Wilson stated that in the first and second Paddington films, we learn about his origins and how he came to his home in London. However, there is still much to discover about what happened before these events. In this third film, Paddington and his friends return to Peru to find the missing pieces to complete his story.

Starring acclaimed actors Olivia Colman and Antonio Banderas, “Paddington in Peru” promises to be an unforgettable adventure for families. It will be released in UK cinemas on November 8 and in the US on January 17, 2025.

Film In Peru, PROMPERÚ's strategy to promote the country as a filming location, provided assistance for filming in Lima and Cusco. This support involved coordinating with public and private entities to secure filming and drone usage permits. Additionally, guidance was provided in processing 26 visas for the film crew.

In recent years, Film In Peru has supported international audiovisual productions such as Dora and the Lost City of Gold, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, Street Food Latin America, Down to earth with Zac Efron, La Reina del Sur, among others.
