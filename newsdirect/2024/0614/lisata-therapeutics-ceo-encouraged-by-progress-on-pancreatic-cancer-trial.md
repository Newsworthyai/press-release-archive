# Lisata Therapeutics CEO encouraged by progress on pancreatic cancer trial

Lisata Therapeutics Inc. CEO David Mazzo talked with Proactive's Stephen Gunnion about the latest milestone in the company's Phase 1b/2a CENDIFOX trial.

Mazzo shared that Lisata has completed patient enrollment for the pancreatic cancer cohorts in the phase 1B/2A clinical trial.

This investigator-initiated trial, led by Dr Anup Kasi at The University of Kansas Cancer Center, is evaluating the safety and efficacy of certepetide (formerly LSTA1) in combination with FOLFIRINOX-based therapies for pancreatic, colon, and appendiceal cancers.

Mazzo highlighted that the trial will enbable the collection of pre- and post-treatment biopsies of tumors. He also mentioned ongoing efforts to complete enrollment in two additional cohorts focusing on colorectal cancer and other tumor types, expecting these to be completed by the end of the year.

Expressing his optimism, Mazzo noted the encouraging progress and enthusiasm surrounding the trial, which is drawing patients from the Kansas City area despite competition from other studies. He anticipates that preliminary results will be available by the end of the year, pending the timely processing of biopsies by external laboratories.
