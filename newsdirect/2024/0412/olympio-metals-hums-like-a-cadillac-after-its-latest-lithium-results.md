# Olympio Metals hums like a Cadillac after its latest lithium results

--News Direct--

Olympio Metals Ltd (ASX:OLY) managing director Sean Delaney sits down with Proactiveâ€™s Jonathan Jackson to discuss recent progress at the Cadillac Lithium Project in Quebec, Canada. The company has completed a 23-hole, 2,715-metre diamond drilling program across four pegmatite dykes, uncovering significant lithium-caesium-tantalum (LCT) geochemical fractionation trends that underscore the area's lithium prospects. Notable discoveries include spodumene with grades reaching 2.3% lithium oxide in the Dyke B area, expanding the project's known lithium potential. This drilling effort, combined with prior surface sampling, indicates that the LCT pegmatites cover a larger area than initially anticipated, setting the stage for expanded regional exploration. Olympio has secured $1.1 million through Canadian Flow-Through Shares and is well-prepared for the upcoming field season. This funding will support continued exploration across their 190-square-kilometre landholding, where numerous high-priority pegmatite targets await testing. The recent drilling has delineated two distinct zones of fractionated pegmatites, hinting at multiple generations of LCT mineralised intrusions. These findings will guide the company's exploration strategy, focusing on areas with elevated potassium-rubidium fractionation trends linked to lithium mineralisation. With over 400 known pegmatites in the Cadillac Project area, Olympio is poised to advance its exploration activities, leveraging the latest geological insights to target high-priority areas in the coming weeks.
