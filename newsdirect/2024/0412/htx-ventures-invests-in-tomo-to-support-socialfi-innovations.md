# HTX Ventures Invests in Tomo to Support SocialFi Innovations

--News Direct--

In a move that underscores its commitment to broadening the reach and usability of Web3 technologies, HTX Ventures, the global investment arm of the cryptocurrency exchange HTX, has announced a strategic investment in Tomo. This all-in-one social wallet platform is poised to redefine the landscape of digital social interactions and content monetization.

Tomo stands at the forefront of the SocialFi movement, providing content creators and their followers a decentralized platform that merges social interaction with financial empowerment. With an ecosystem built on blockchain technology, Tomo introduces an effective marketplace for influencers to monetize content directly, thanks to its blockchain-powered financial incentives.

The platform boasts several unique features designed to deepen user connections and leverage digital networks for value creation. These include Tomoji for personalized interactions, TomoID for seamless user identification, a Web3 social wallet for secure transactions, Keys for equitable social media monetization, and more. Expanding its creative horizon, Tomo recently launched the ERC404 Meme Launchpad on Base chain, named Tomoji. In collaboration with Sean Kyah Koons, they introduced their premier dragon-themed collection, 'LONG'. Tomoji allows for the fractionalization of NFTs, thereby enhancing market liquidity and offering a more flexible approach to ownership. Within the Tomoji launchpad, Tomojis provide seamless minting, gifting, and trading capabilities, giving users an intuitive and interactive platform to engage with digital art.

Edward, Managing Partner at HTX Ventures, emphasized the strategic fit of Tomo within the Web3 landscape: “Our investment in Tomo is driven by our belief in the transformative potential of SocialFi to redefine user engagement on social platforms. Tomo stands out by embedding financial incentives into social interactions, thus realigning the value distribution between creators and their audience. This not only introduces a vast new user base to Web3 but also pioneers a fairer and more transparent model for social media monetization.”

Recently securing a $3.5 million seed funding round led by Polychain Capital, Tomo is poised to accelerate its technological advancements and bridge the existing divide between conventional social media and the burgeoning Web3 ecosystem. This capital infusion will fuel Tomo’s mission to cultivate a transparent marketplace for social capital, ensuring creators and users alike are rewarded for their contributions to the digital community.
