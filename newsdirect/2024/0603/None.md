# UFC and Aires Tech Inc. Join Forces to Reach a Global Audience of 700 Million Fans

In a world increasingly reliant on technology, concerns about electromagnetic radiation (EMR) have led to a surge in demand for innovative solutions. American Aires Inc. (CSE: WIFI) (OTCQB: AAIRF) has been making significant strides in the tech industry with its cutting-edge approach to electromagnetic radiation (EMF) protection. The US market for EMF protection is estimated to be worth $5 billion, representing only a small portion of the even larger global opportunity. With the announcement of a multi-year global marketing partnership with UFC last week, now could be the time to take a look at AAIRF.

The UFC Collaboration:

AAIRF's visibility will increase significantly as a result of the partnership with UFC, the top mixed martial arts organization and a division of TKO Group Holdings (NYSE:TKO), which Endeavor Group Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: EDR) owns a majority stake in. With UFC’s reach extending to over 700 million fans in 170 countries and approximately 975 million households, this collaboration is poised to place Aires Tech in front of a massive global audience. The integration of Aires branding within UFC’s major events, including pay-per-view broadcasts and other media, will provide unparalleled reach.

Grant Norris-Jones, Head of Global Partnerships at TKO, highlighted the synergy between the two brands: “Aires aligns well with our brand in several respects, including their focus on innovation and being a first mover in their industry.” Josh Bruni, CEO of Aires, emphasized the benefits of the partnership: “This collaboration not only amplifies our global reach but also connects us with UFC's dedicated audience, who value peak performance and personal well-being.”

The partnership was activated at UFC 302: Makhachev vs. Poirier on June 1, 2024, marking a significant milestone in Aires' journey to become a global leader in EMF protection technology. The company hopes that this collaboration is expected to drive brand awareness and sales growth, solidifying Aires’ position as a leader in the market.

Innovative Technology:

The exclusive silicon-based resonator technology from Aires is intended to block dangerous electromagnetic radiation (EMR) released by consumer electronics. This innovation is embodied in their Lifetune products, which target EMR from cellphones, computers, baby monitors, Wi-Fi, and high-speed 5G networks. With over 20 years and $20 million invested in research and development, Aires has positioned itself as a pioneer in the field of EMR protection.

The company's products appeal to a wide range of customers, including biohackers, athletes, individuals concerned with fertility, and those seeking better sleep. Aires operates a direct-to-consumer sales model with fulfillment centers in the USA, Canada, Australia, and the EU, and has recently established a new center in the UK to support its global expansion efforts.

Financial Strength and Growth Trajectory:

American Aires Inc. has demonstrated robust financial performance, with gross margins averaging around 60%. This is comparable to top technology companies like Nvidia and Apple, which boast gross margins of 75% and 45%, respectively. The company achieved positive EBITDA (adjusted) in its most recent quarter, underscoring its strong financial health.

In fiscal year 2023, Aires reported a record annual order volume of $10.4 million, a 79% increase year-over-year. The company's direct-to-consumer business now ships products to over 60 countries, with significant growth observed in Australia and the EU. In Q1 2024, Aires reported a 37% year-over-year increase in sales, despite typical Q1 consumer spending weaknesses. The company's cash balance also saw a substantial improvement, increasing from $0.03 million in Q4 2023 to $2.3 million in Q1 2024, bolstered by successful financings in February and May 2024.

CEO Josh Bruni stated, “Now that Q1 and our heavy lifting on the IR front are behind us, we're refocusing our efforts on deploying the capital we raised across three major fronts: forging prominent new marketing partnerships, building universal brand awareness, and expanding internationally. In other words, continuing to do what's enabled our multi-year trajectory of significant revenue growth so we can make 2024 our best year ever.”
