As the copper market continues to heat up, mineral exploration company Gladiator Metals Corp. (TSXV:GLAD) (OTCQB:GDTRF) is making significant strides in its exploration efforts at the Whitehorse Copper Belt.

The Whitehorse Copper Project is an advanced exploration for copper, molybdenum, silver, and gold skarns in the Yukon Territory, Canada. Covering 314 claims over 5,380 hectares, it includes over 30 skarn occurrences in a 35 by 5 km arc.

Discovered in 1897, the project saw significant production from 1967 to 1982, yielding 267.5 million pounds of copper, 225,000 ounces of gold, and 2.838 million ounces of silver. It has excellent access via roads and trails near the South Klondike and Alaska Highways, with power available from the Yukon grid.

Gladiator Metals Corp. (TSXV:GLAD) (OTCQB:GDTRF) recently received processed results from a high-definition drone-borne aeromagnetic survey over the Whitehorse Copper Belt. This survey has identified potential extensions to known mineralization, highlighted significant undrilled exploration targets associated with high-magnetic responses, and supported a strong correlation between occurrences of magnetite-copper skarn mineralization and reported magnetic anomalies.

The survey results support Gladiator’s belief that such detailed surveys can effectively be used as direct detection tools for mineralized bodies under cover. An initial review has identified significant new target areas with high magnetic responses, prompting Gladiator to stake an additional 54 km² of claims, increasing the total area of the Whitehorse Copper Project to 133 km².

In response to acquiring this significant data set and new claims, Gladiator Metals has advanced its summer field campaigns to immediately follow up on magnetic targets. The company has already begun geological mapping, rock chipping, and soil sampling, with ground-based geophysics (IP and EM) set to commence shortly ahead of planned drilling.

Gladiator Metals Corp. (TSXV:GLAD) (OTCQB:GDTRF) CEO, Jason Bontempo, stated that this survey, the first of its size, coverage, and technological advancement in the area, was designed to explore prospective sections of geology for magnetite-copper skarns hidden under thin cover. Given the high magnetic response of previously identified magnetite-copper skarn mineralization, Gladiator is confident in the survey's potential as a direct detection tool for further high-grade copper mineralization.

Multiple new, undrilled magnetic anomalies have been identified, indicating the extensive new discovery potential of high-grade copper in the Whitehorse Copper Project area. Gladiator’s field crews are now actively following up on these anomalies and look forward to updating the market on the developing target areas ahead of drilling later this year.

Gladiator Metals Expands Whitehorse Copper Project With New Jackson Copper-Skarn ProspectOn May 30, Gladiator Metals (TSXV:GLAD) (OTCQB:GDTRF) announced it has staked 55 claims, adding 11.3 km² to their tenure, covering the Jackson Copper-Skarn prospect. This new prospect is located 15 km west of existing claims at the Whitehorse Copper Project. This area spans over 6 km of a promising contact zone between Cretaceous intrusive bodies and Triassic metasediments, key for mineralization in the Whitehorse Copper Belt.

The Jackson Copper-Skarn prospect shows significant exploration potential, indicated by historical shallow drill results intersecting high-grade copper, gold, and silver skarns. Notable results include 6.12 meters at 5.61% copper, 1.03 grams per ton gold, and 247 grams per ton silver from 55.14 meters, 10.67 meters at 6.45 grams per ton gold from 71.02 meters within 21.88 meters at 3.45 grams per ton gold, and 1.99 meters at 4.0 grams per ton gold from 19.35 meters.

Undrilled target areas highlighted by surface-exposed high-grade copper skarn mineralization include the Franklin Target, with rock chip samples showing up to 9.4% copper and 6.36 grams per ton gold, and the Hamilton Target, with rock chip samples showing up to 3.48% copper and 10.4% zinc. The Janet Target also shows rock chip samples with up to 7.85% copper and 16.59 grams per ton gold. Initial airborne magnetics conducted by previous explorers highlight undrilled high-magnetic anomalies over more than 4.4 km of strike.

Gladiator Metals Corp. (TSXV:GLAD) (OTCQB:GDTRF) has begun summer exploration programs, including mapping and sampling, in the area, with drone magnetics planned for later in the season.
