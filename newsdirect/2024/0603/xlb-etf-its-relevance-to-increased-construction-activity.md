# XLB ETF: Itâ€™s Relevance to Increased Construction Activity

The United States has recently seen a resurgence in the construction industry. Investors aiming to benefit from this rise in construction activity may want to explore an exchange-traded fund (ETF), the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLB), which offers a snapshot of this bustling sector.

As of the latest reports, the XLB ETF's strategic holdings reflect its commitment to offering diverse exposure within this thriving industry.

Key Holdings Within XLB*

XLB encompasses a diverse portfolio of businesses operating in different domains, including chemicals, construction materials, packaging and containers, metals and mining, along with paper and forest products. There are currently 28 companies in the portfolio.

Leading the pack we have Linde PLC, a global leader in industrial gasses and engineering, at 21.45%. It is followed by Freeport-McMoRan Incorporated, a leading mining company, holding 7.19% of XLB.

Next we have Sherwin-Williams, which is renowned for their excellence in paints, coatings, and related products, at 7.08%. Following is Ecolab, a prominent player in the industrial sector, making a significant contribution to XLB at 5.76%. Finally, there is Air Products and Chemicals, another key player in industrial gasses and related equipment, with 5.27%.

This extensive coverage offers investors the opportunity to tap into numerous facets of the materials sector, proving advantageous during phases of economic expansion or heightened infrastructure investment. As the construction industry continues forward, XLB, with its 0.09% expense ratio**, remains well-positioned.

Increasing Demand for Building Materials

The steady demand for building materials has been a key factor in the growing relevance of XLB. As we continue to navigate the post-COVID-19 era, construction activities are on a significant rise, creating a surge in the need for raw materials.

Furthermore, the increasing focus on infrastructure development is adding fuel to this rising demand. The recent passage of the infrastructure bill opens up avenues for substantial investments in diverse fields such as transportation, broadband, and clean energy, thereby making XLB a potentially attractive investment option.

The Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLB) provides diversified exposure to the thriving materials sector. With its current demand driven by ongoing construction projects and potential infrastructure expenditure, XLB emerges as a compelling choice for investors seeking to tap into these trends.
