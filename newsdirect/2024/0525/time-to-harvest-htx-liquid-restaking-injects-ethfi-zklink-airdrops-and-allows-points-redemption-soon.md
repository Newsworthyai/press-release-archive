# Time to Harvest! HTX Liquid Restaking Injects ETHFI & zkLink Airdrops and Allows Points Redemption Soon

This summer, as the scorching heat envelopes the Northern Hemisphere, an even more exciting anticipation filled the air—the arrival of the restaking airdrop harvest season. HTX, the global leading cryptocurrency exchange, is heating up the restaking season with the addition of Etherfi (ETHFI) and zkLink airdrops to its Liquid Restaking event. Points earned through the event will soon be accessible for redemption, allowing users to capitalize on their participation. According to the previous report, the event has recently increased its quota to over $150 million and introduced a new version featuring a clearer reward display and automatic update from LRS points to r-points.

What is New on HTX Liquid Restaking This May? HTX reportedly added Etherfi (ETHFI) and zkLink to its Liquid Restaking event's rewards pool on May 22. Additionally, the point redemption feature will be available starting at 03:00 (UTC) on May 31, with the approaching first batch of rewards including BouncebBit airdrops, ETHFI, TRX, USDT, and $HTX.

Let's look at the update details as follows:

1. Enabling BTC: A daily prize pool of 250,000 r-ZKL points, equivalent to zkLink airdrops by staking 500 BTC daily.

2. Enabling ETH: A daily prize pool of 50,000 r-ETHFI points. 100 r-ETHFI = 1 ETHFI

3. BounceBit points (r-BB) distribution will be ceased on May 22. You can redeem your r-BB points for rewards starting on May 31.

Moreover, HTX will continuously increase the event quota and introduce new premium projects based on the event participation to help you earn more than on-chain retaking.
