“We started Cutz 4 Kids back in 2018 to provide a meaningful way to give back to the communities and neighborhoods we serve,” said Derrick Hines, VP Store Operations – City Gear. “It’s always a popular event and we are happy to help out local families shopping for the new school year and to get kids hyped about getting back to class.”

Each year, City Gear hosts multiple Cutz 4 Kids Back-to-School appreciation events at select stores across the country. Each event is a community celebration to kick off the new school year, complete with giveaways, music, refreshments, free haircuts, school supplies and fun for family and friends. Professional barbers are onsite at each participating location, providing complimentary professional children’s haircuts for boys and girls. Children of all ages are welcome to get a free haircut and complimentary school supplies on a first-come, first-serve basis, while supplies last.
