Benchmark International has successfully facilitated a transaction between Columbia, MD-based Quotient, Inc. ("Quotient") and Maumee, OH-based Virtual Technologies Group ("VTG"). Quotient provides a wide range of device-agnostic digital solutions for federal clients.

"Quotient President and Co-Founder Clark Lare built a gem of a company in the Federal-IT space, with long-standing relationships at key federal agencies providing highly skilled services to some of our nation's most critical mission sets," commented Benchmark Senior Transaction Director William Sullivan. "We brought this opportunity to market fully understanding its differentiated sector position, and we were well aligned with our client in finding the best combination of cultural fit and enterprise value. After a highly selective process, VTG emerged as clearly the best fit, with a strong plan for future growth and a highly complementary team and structure. We are very excited for the entire Quotient team."
