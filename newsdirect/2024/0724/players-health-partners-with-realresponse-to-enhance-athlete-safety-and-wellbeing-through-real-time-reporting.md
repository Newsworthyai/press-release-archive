# Players Health Partners with RealResponse to Enhance Athlete Safety and Wellbeing Through Real-Time Reporting

Players Health, the leading provider of athlete safety and insurance solutions, today announced a partnership with RealResponse, a powerful web-based platform where athletes can anonymously report improper conduct through confidential two-way dialogue. Together, the two industry leaders will implement an innovative reporting platform for over five million athletes, leagues, and organizations in the Players Health specialty youth sports insurance ecosystem.

This collaboration will blend RealResponse’s multi-channel communication technology into Players Health's sports-centric insurance, education, training, and compliance offerings, empowering kids, parents, guardians, and coaches to share feedback, ask questions, and access resources anonymously and in real-time. The RealResponse platform has already proven effective in facilitating rapid communication across amateur athletics, offering real-time anonymous visibility into critical situations, allowing for timely support for mental health needs.

“Everything we do is centered around creating the safest and most accessible environments for amateur athletes to play the sports they love. RealResponse’s integration into our growing community allows us to provide our clients with the protected and secure communication tools needed to achieve clarity when investigating incidents,” said Tyrre Burks, CEO & Founder of Players Health. “This partnership creates a crucial framework for our clients to manage risk effectively and act promptly on valuable feedback.”

As part of this partnership, Players Health becomes a preferred insurance, health and safety provider for RealResponse, ensuring that youth sports organizations have access to comprehensive coverage alongside innovative reporting solutions. Conversely, RealResponse will serve as a preferred feedback and anonymous reporting platform for Players Health, reinforcing its commitment to athlete safety and proactive risk management. This strategic alignment will enhance the resources available to organizations, and help foster a culture of safety and accountability across the youth sports ecosystem.

“Players Health and RealResponse are committed to empowering amateur sports and educational institutions with innovative technological solutions that resonate with today's youth,” said David Chadwick, Founder and CEO of RealResponse. “By utilizing preferred communication channels—such as text, QR codes and WhatsApp—we're taking significant strides to prevent abuse and misconduct. Our advanced, seamless auto-routing capabilities streamline administrative processes, making it easier for organizations to uphold safety standards while supporting Players Health’s expanding network of clients.”
