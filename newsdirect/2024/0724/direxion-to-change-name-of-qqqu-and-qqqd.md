# Direxion to Change Name of QQQU and QQQD

Direxion, a leading provider of tradeable and thematic ETFs, announced the name change of QQQU and QQQD. Effective August 16, 2024, the new fund names will be the Direxion Daily Magnificent 7 Bull 2X Shares (Ticker: QQQU) and the Direxion Daily Magnificent 7 Bear 1X Shares (Ticker: QQQD). Coinciding with the name changes, QQQU and QQQD will seek to achieve 200%, or 100% of the inverse (opposite), respectively, of the daily performance of the Indxx Magnificent 7 Index.

The Index will continue to track to track the performance of the seven largest Nasdaq 100-listed companies, all of which are household names, including Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA).

“QQQU and QQQD capitalize on key market drivers, to include artificial intelligence, cloud computing and semiconductors," said Direxion Managing Director and Head of Sales and Alternatives, Edward Egilinsky. “The new fund names better align with the opportunities traders have expressed with their short-term convictions on the Magnificent 7.”
