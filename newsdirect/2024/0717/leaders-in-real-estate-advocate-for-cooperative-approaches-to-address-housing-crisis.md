# Leaders in Real Estate Advocate for Cooperative Approaches to Address Housing Crisis

K3 Holdings, a privately held real estate investment firm with extensive holdings throughout the United States is advocating for collaboration as stakeholders consider housing policies to combat homelessness. In a recent article published by The Mortgage Note and a blog post at the K3 Holdings and Alpine LA Properties websites, leaders stressed the need for cooperative approaches to policies that can address housing options, especially for disadvantaged populations.

“At K3 Holdings and Alpine LA Properties, we experience firsthand the complex challenges faced by both landlords and tenants in the quest for safe and adequate housing. The ongoing economic turbulence, driven by higher interest rates and inflation, underscores the urgency for cohesive, sensible housing policies. As political leaders seek effective solutions, expanding the perspectives at the table is essential,” stated Nathan Kadisha, a K3 Principal. “Safe and adequate housing is a cornerstone for community stability and prosperity—it is a moral imperative. When families struggle to find stable homes, the repercussions ripple through society, leading to increased homelessness and pressure on social services. This issue affects every facet of our communities, highlighting the critical need for effective policy solutions.”

According to Kadisha, effective housing policy should create mutually beneficial outcomes for both landlords and tenants. Unfortunately, policy debates often frame these groups as adversaries, competing for limited resources. This adversarial mindset overlooks the shared goals and common interests that can unite landlords and tenants.

While often considered unlikely allies, landlords have a vested interest in advocating for policies that support tenants and promote vibrant, inclusive communities. Advocacy from property companies can help ensure the financial health of investments and fosters environments where tenants can thrive.

“As stakeholders continue to seek solutions, policymakers should work collaboratively to address the root causes of housing insecurity while protecting property owners' interests. This approach can solve critical issues facing all parties. Unlike so many political battles, when it comes to affordable housing policies, one group does not have to lose for another to win,” Kadisha continued.

One key area for sensible policy action is rent stabilization. Thoughtfully implemented rent stabilization can provide tenants with the stability they need while allowing landlords to earn a fair return. By capping annual rent increases at a rate tied to inflation, we can ensure rental housing remains affordable without imposing undue burdens on property owners.

Ensuring fair treatment for tenants and landlords alike helps build stronger, more resilient communities.

“As property managers, we bring a unique perspective to the table, balancing tenant needs with our business interests. Lopsided policies can harm the broader community, making it imperative for us to advocate for balanced, unifying housing policies. By working together, we can bridge the gap between stakeholders and pave the way for a more equitable, sustainable housing market.”

Addressing the current housing crisis demands bold, visionary leadership from policymakers. By prioritizing policies that promote stability, fairness, and inclusivity, stronger communities where everyone has access to safe, stable, and affordable housing can be built. Property managers are ready to collaborate with policymakers, tenants, and other stakeholders to realize this vision.
