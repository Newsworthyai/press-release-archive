Laser Photonics Corp. (NASDAQ: LASE) has emerged as a leader in laser cleaning and cutting technology, but that’s not the only area it’s trailblazing in. From next-generation laser systems to anti-drone solutions, LPC has many innovations in the pipeline.

It shouldn’t come as a surprise. Laser Photonics, which traces its roots back to 1981, has long been recognized as a leading manufacturer of industrial-grade laser solutions for marking, engraving, cleaning and cutting. Leveraging its extensive experience in delivering cutting-edge laser-powered systems to industry leaders across diverse markets and its world-class R&D team, the company owns a number of licenses and patents for innovative and advanced laser products and technologies.

The result: a new generation of vanguard laser blasting technologies and equipment that are automated, precise, non-abrasive, eco-friendly and emit no hazardous particles that can harm the operator. Laser Photonics says its technology also addresses the health, safety, environmental and regulatory issues associated with the old methods, which is why it counts Fortune 1000 manufacturers in the aerospace, automotive, defense, energy, industrial, maritime, space exploration and shipbuilding industries as customers.

With a multi-billion-dollar market opportunity in laser cutting and cleaning alone, it would be easy for Laser Photonics to sit back and enjoy the ride, but that’s not in its DNA. Innovators at heart, LPC is taking its technology and industry prowess to new levels.

Protecting The Skies Take the Laser Shield Anti-Drone System (LSAD), which LPC is testing with parent company, Fonon Corporation. Fonon is a multi-market holding company, R&D center, equipment designer and manufacturer of advanced laser material processing systems for subtractive and additive manufacturing. The two successfully tested a laser prototype that can destroy small-scale unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in conflict zones and expeditionary locations.

The prototype was tested at LPC’s new state-of-the-art facility, which features an internal laser range. This enabled Laser Photonics and Fonon to evaluate the proof of concept under controlled conditions. The range served to test the lasers’ capabilities in terms of precision and effectiveness when it came to targeting and destroying distant objects. LPC said the facility will play a crucial role in developing LSAD.

“Defense professionals worldwide are focused on anti-drone technology due to its increasing prevalence, which presents an opportunity for LPC and Fonon to collaborate on this project,” said Wayne Tupuola, CEO of Laser Photonics. “We believe that Fonon’s LSAD has the potential to become a must-have technology for modern defense infrastructures.”

Mobile And On The Go Then there’s the company’s next-generation upgraded CleanTech laser cleaning systems, which it launched in May. Aimed at on-the-go applications, the new lasers include mobile connectivity for remote monitoring and control, a new compact form factor and a smart overheat protection feature for increased safety. The lasers can be used manually or through its new and improved Robotic Cell unit for automated cleaning. Laser Photonics said the CleanTech Next-Generation Laser Systems are the world’s most compact and portable Class I and Class IV systems in the market. Compact and portable lasers can be useful in many industries – including aviation, manufacturing and shipbuilding – to remove rust, grease, mold and other contaminants.

“Modern challenges demand tech-savvy solutions,” says Tupuola. “We are thrilled to roll out our next generation of CleanTech systems. With our new technology improvements, we are ready to tap into diverse market segments and bring in new clients.”

Building on its next-generation lasers for cleaning, the company also overhauled its lasers for cutting, rolling out the SaberTech laser-cutting systems. The line will include upgraded versions of the TiTAN Express and TiTAN FX high-power laser-cutting systems. These next-generation systems will feature Turbo Piercing technology, an invention that minimizes the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of the material being processed, thereby reducing material distortion caused by laser heat throughout the cutting operation. By providing fiber laser cutting, LPC gets access to untapped potential in the aerospace, automotive, maritime and defense industries.

Taking It To The Next Level Turning the centuries-old multi-billion-dollar sand and abrasives blasting market on its head has always been the goal of Laser Photonics, but it is taking it to the next level with AI and IoT technology. Laser Photonics is adding both to its existing laser products for even more speed, precision and automation. Laser Photonics plans to provide on-site support and AI and IoT training, too, setting it apart from its rivals. The idea is to not only lead in laser cutting and cleaning but also expand through innovation. It's why the company has so many licenses and patents.

Laser Photonics has been a leader in laser cutting and cleaning for decades and is taking that expertise to new heights and markets. Its anti-drone lasers and fiber laser-cutting systems are just the start, and many developments can be expected to continue to come from this innovator.
