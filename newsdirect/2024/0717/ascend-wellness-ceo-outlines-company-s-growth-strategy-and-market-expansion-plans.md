# Ascend Wellness CEO Outlines Company's Growth Strategy and Market Expansion Plans

Ascend Wellness CEO John Hartman joined Steve Darling from Proactive to discuss the companyâ€™s current status and future plans. Ascend Wellness, a prominent multi-state cannabis operator in the United States, has established its presence primarily in the Midwest, Northeast, and Mid-Atlantic regions. The company, now in its fifth year of operation, has expanded its footprint to seven states, including Ohio and Pennsylvania, both of which are transitioning to recreational cannabis use. During the interview, Hartman emphasized Ascend Wellness's strategic approach of focusing on select markets and maximizing the number of dispensaries allowed in each state. This targeted strategy is aimed at optimizing market penetration and ensuring robust growth. Drawing on his extensive background in wholesale, retail, and manufacturing, Hartman highlighted the company's emphasis on effective capital deployment and growth through mergers and acquisitions (M&A). A significant development discussed was the refinancing of a term loan due in August 2025. This financial maneuver provides Ascend Wellness with a five-year runway to concentrate on growth initiatives. The refinancing is expected to enhance the company's balance sheet management, providing greater financial stability and flexibility.
