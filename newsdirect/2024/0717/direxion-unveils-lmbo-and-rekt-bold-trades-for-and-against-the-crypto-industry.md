# Direxion Unveils LMBO and REKT: Bold Trades For, and Against, the Crypto Industry

Direxion, a leading provider of tradeable and thematic ETFs, today announced the launch of the Direxion Daily Crypto Industry Bull 2X Shares (Ticker: LMBO) and the Direxion Daily Crypto Industry Bear 1X Shares (Ticker: REKT). LMBO and REKT seek daily investments results, before fees and expenses, of 200%, or 100% of the inverse (opposite), respectively, of the performance of the Solactive Distributed Ledger & Decentralized Payment Tech Index.

The Index seeks to track the performance of US-listed securities that have business operations in the field of distributed ledger or decentralized payment technology, which includes the following business fields: blockchain technology, non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance, and digital asset mining hardware.

“Crypto equities are among the fastest-growing companies in the world, now representing an almost $3 trillion asset class,” said Direxion Managing Director, Edward Egilinsky. “LMBO and REKT provide focused exposure for traders to express their short-term conviction on companies building the future of a crypto-driven, decentralized economy.”

The global markets landscape is rapidly evolving, presenting new challenges and opportunities. As the crypto industry continues to show promising growth, Direxion is committed to providing traders with timely vehicles to align with the shifting dynamics of the financial markets.

Leveraged and Inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by sophisticated investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.

An investor should carefully consider a Fund’s investment objective, risks, charges, and expenses before investing.
