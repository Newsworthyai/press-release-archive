Data Vault Holdings Inc., which is selling its IP and IT assets to WiSA Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: WISA), just launched a next-generation hologram product the company says is a step forward in the fields of advertising, signage and live events.

Data Vault Holdings developed the product in partnership with HYPERVSN, a provider of holographic solutions which is backed by prominent venture investors including Sir Richard Branson and Mark Cuban. This follows WiSA’s definitive agreement to acquire Data Vault Holdings’ Datavault® and ADIO® IP assets. DVHolo, powered by ADIO, provides businesses with an immersive real-time 3D holographic to sell their products, host concerts and promote brands.

Data Vault says DVHolo gives companies 40% longer viewing and engagement time and double the chance of the holographic images being seen compared to 2D digital signage. Meanwhile HYPERVSN reports holographic signage has the potential to boost the product’s sales by as much as 40%. With DVHolo, customers also get access to ADIO’s analytics and reporting capabilities, giving businesses insights into consumer behavior and the campaign's effectiveness.

“Unlike traditional advertising, this powerful combination brings an entirely new experience that captures and better retains audience attention, significantly increasing engagement and conversions," said Nathaniel Bradley, co-founder and CEO of Data Vault Holdings.

Timing Is Everything This new product suite combines ADIO, which leverages data packets embedded within audio signals to deliver targeted content, with HYPERVSN’s 3D holograms. By synchronizing the audio signals with HYPERVSN’s 3D holographic visuals, the companies say DVHolo offers a fully immersive experience. In addition to serving up ads, DVHolo is designed to broadcast live events in real time, featuring high-definition 3D holograms of presenters, performers or speakers.

The launch of DVHolo comes shortly after WiSA Technologies, a provider of immersive wireless sound technology for intelligent devices and next-generation home entertainment systems, entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement to buy Data Vault’s Datavault and ADIO IP and IT assets in a $210 million deal. The deal was inked in September and is expected to close in the first quarter. Once the transaction is complete, WiSA expects to license Datavault’s technology across a broad range of industries, including sports and entertainment, events and venues, restaurants, education and other industries.

“This exciting transaction leverages our public company structure, creating a larger, more dynamic entity with broad reach in multiple rapidly growing markets,” Brett Moyer, CEO of WiSA Technologies, said when the deal was announced. “Datavault’s substantial IP portfolio significantly amplifies our spatial audio technology and adds powerful HPC assets.” Bradley will become CEO and Moyer CFO upon the closing of the transaction. The company will also change its name to Datavault Inc.

Holographic Market Appears To Be Taking Off DVHolo is launching at a time when the global holographic display market is taking off, driven by advances in laser technology, optics and digital light processing. That has resulted in brighter and more realistic 3D images, reports Global Market Insights. The market research firm expects the holographic market to reach $23 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of more than 20% over 2024-2032. Data Vault and HYPERVSN said they are positioned to capitalize on growth by offering a solution that meets the increasing demand for immersive digital experiences across different industries.

"HYPERVSN's partnership with Data Vault Holdings allows organizations to extend their reach, engage with larger audiences and maximize impact, without the significant costs typically associated with traditional methods,” said Kiryl Chykeyuk, CEO and Co-Founder of HYPERVSN, which counts Sir Richard Branson and Mark Cuban as investors. “DVHolo's ability to seamlessly integrate content into various platforms ensures that brands can activate and monetize audiences anywhere, anytime, with unparalleled efficiency."
