# NuggMD is Providing Free Medical Cannabis Evaluations to Veterans on Veterans Day

NuggMD, the nation's leading telemedicine platform for cannabis, today announced that it is providing free online medical marijuana evaluations to veterans from Nov. 7 to Nov. 11.

Rates of PTSD range from 10% to 30% among war-time vets and 31% struggle with chronic pain. Additionally, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, fewer than 50% of veterans in need of mental health treatment end up receiving it. While cannabis remains illegal federally, 38 states and several U.S. territories have legalized cannabis used to treat qualifying medical conditions, among them PTSD and chronic pain.

“Every adult deserves the freedom to use cannabis. That is what we stand for,” said Bobby Brock, vice president of marketing at NuggMD. “We urge our peers in the cannabis industry to use their resources to help veterans, because serving in the armed forces is one of the most selfless, patriotic things an American can do. We also invite policymakers to take seriously the potential that cannabis may have to improve the quality of life of those who choose to enlist, both as they serve and after they return home.”

The free evaluations will be offered to all veterans who reside in the 28 markets that NuggMD serves, and who provide valid proof of service and their state-issued identification. The applicable states are listed on NuggMD’s website, and veterans can secure their appointment using NuggMD’s on-demand platform from 8 AM to 10 PM in their local time zone.

In addition to providing free evaluations to veterans, the company is also offering a 25% discount to the spouses of veterans, under the same conditions.

Since its launch in 2016, NuggMD's affiliated medical cannabis practitioners have helped over two million patients connect with qualified medical cannabis doctors.
