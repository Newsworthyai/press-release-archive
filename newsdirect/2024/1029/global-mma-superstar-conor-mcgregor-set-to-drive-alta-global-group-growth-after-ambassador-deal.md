# Global MMA Superstar Conor McGregor Set To Drive Alta Global Group Growth After Ambassador Deal

Alta Global Group (NYSE:MMA), the premiere tech company on a mission to convert 640 million loyal combat sports fans to participants, has been gaining widespread attention from investors as it appears well positioned for major growth.

In what is yet another critical milestone for the company, Alta Global Group (NYSE American: MMA) announced a new brand ambassadorship deal with Conor McGregor, the iconic former UFC superstar. This new deal incentivizes McGregor to assist Alta in any way possible and will potentially see him increase his stake in the company since he will get additional bonus shares as MMA’s stock price moves higher all the way to $20 per share.

McGregor, who is known for his unparalleled reach and influence, boasting over 70 million followers across X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and Facebook, will leverage his extensive fan base to promote Alta's innovative products and programs. As a former UFC Featherweight and Lightweight Champion, the first to hold titles in two weight classes simultaneously, and a former Cage Warriors Featherweight and Lightweight Champion, McGregor's achievements have cemented his status as the biggest pay-per-view draw in MMA history.

His fights have consistently broken records, with his bout against Khabib Nurmagomedov at UFC 229 drawing 2.4 million buys and his boxing debut against Floyd Mayweather Jr. garnering over 5.3 million buys illustrating his massive appeal to fans of combat sports. This ties in well with the fact that Alta Global Group (NYSE:MMA) has already amassed its own substantial user base and strong user engagement of about 15 million monthly views and over 5 million social media users. It also currently ranks in the top 3 for ‘MMA’ in global search results.

In addition to that, McGregor's contribution to popularizing MMA and the UFC on a global scale is undeniable considering that in 2021 Forbes recognized him as the world's highest-paid athlete, earning $180 million.

Nick Langton, Founder and CEO of Alta, remarked, "Conor McGregor’s involvement is a game-changer for Alta Global Group. His legacy and influence in the world of MMA are unmatched. We are honored and thrilled to have his endorsement and support, which will be instrumental in revolutionizing the martial arts and combat sports landscape."

That is why McGregor's role will be pivotal in the growth of Alta’s Warrior Training Program and the promotion of Hype, Alta’s all-in-one marketing platform tailored for gyms, coaches, and combat sport participants. He will also play a significant part in promoting Alta’s newly established partnership with UFC Gyms, which will integrate the Warrior Training Program across their network of over 150 gyms worldwide.

For context, Hype is like a mini-website builder, a CRM, and a payments processor, all built into one that you can operate from your smartphone. What this platform basically does is that it allows business owners to take their followers from social media apps and funnel them into a platform with more freedom and tools to communicate and monetize without being under the mercy of algorithms.

Now add this to the fact that Alta has already built a huge database of over 9000 professional and amateur athlete profiles, 5645+ potential content creator profiles, and 3500+ tutorial libraries. That means that Alta Global Group (NYSE:MMA) is well positioned to provide marketing content, training syllabuses for gyms and coaches, and connect the underlying fans to an opportunity to train either online or inside a gym at one of the company’s gym partners globally.

This is a win-win deal for everyone in the ecosystem, as fans interested in participating in the sport can be matched up with a coach and gym easily. Another important thing for investors to note is that Alta is monetizing in a way that the UFC or other large professional promotions don't presently do, which is through fan base participation and could make it a very attractive company in the eyes of these much larger companies in the future.

More recently, the company announced that it had sealed a partnership deal with UFC Gym, including their Warrior Training program, which could bring in revenue of at least $7 million annually, illustrating just how substantial this opportunity is.

Alta’s market capitalization is about $40 million right now, but there's plenty of room for upside, especially now that McGregor has become the company’s official ambassador based on the kind of social media reach he has.

Moreover, according to a recent TechSci Research report, the global combat sports market is set for explosive growth driven by rising global interest in fitness and the widespread adoption of combat sports as a means of physical exercise as consumers realize the health benefits and mental discipline associated with these activities. This market is set to experience robust growth, growing from $8.7 billion in 2023 to about $12.6 billion by 2029, representing a CAGR of 6.5%.
