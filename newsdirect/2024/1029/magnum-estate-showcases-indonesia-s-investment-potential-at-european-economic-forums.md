Representing Indonesia’s potential as a dynamic global economic hub, Magnum Estate shared insights from its flagship projects in Bali and upcoming developments throughout the archipelago. The forums highlighted Indonesia’s goal to become one of the world’s top five economies by 2045, underpinned by its position as Southeast Asia’s largest economy. According to recent data, foreign direct investment in Indonesia surged by 22.3% in the first half of 2024, signaling increasing global confidence in the region’s economic prospects.

Particular attention at these forums was given to Magnum Estate’s ambitious projects. During his presentation, Magnum Estate partner Andrejs Senkovs outlined investment opportunities and showcased the company’s vision for transformative real estate developments. Senkovs highlighted Magnum Estate’s role in drawing international investment to Indonesia and emphasized the company’s active engagement in high-impact projects, including its participation in the development of Indonesia’s new capital city, Nusantara. The company’s presentation on September 25 to the President of Indonesia underscored the national significance of this new capital initiative.

Indonesia’s tourism sector, particularly Bali, continues to thrive. In the first half of 2024, 5.1 million foreign tourists visited Indonesia, marking a 46% increase from 2023. Bali has been celebrated globally as a top travel destination, especially for winter, wellness, and romantic tourism, creating significant growth opportunities in the luxury real estate market.

Through its active participation in international events, Magnum Estate strengthens Indonesia’s economic ties with Europe, offering new avenues for mutually beneficial partnerships. As a developer with strong government support and a proven track record, Magnum Estate is well-positioned to support European businesses in establishing projects in Indonesia.
