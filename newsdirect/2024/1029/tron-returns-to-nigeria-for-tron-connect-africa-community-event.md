Founded in September 2017 by Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services, boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2024, it has over 267 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 8.7 billion total transactions, and over $16 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN.
