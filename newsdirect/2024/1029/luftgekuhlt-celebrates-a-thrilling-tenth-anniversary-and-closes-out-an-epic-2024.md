# Luftgekühlt Celebrates a Thrilling Tenth Anniversary and Closes Out an Epic 2024!

To celebrate ten years of the Luftgekühlt event series, focusing on the incredible air-cooled Porsche models and their rich history, the organizers ventured to realize their most ambitious plans to date and enjoyed tremendous success shared with tens of thousands of Porsche fans from around the world.

For its tenth season, Luftgekühlt 10 returned to the site of its most memorable event to date to finish the story: Universal Studios Backlot. And The Sequel was even bigger and better than the original.

The Luft 10 experience stretched more than a half-mile through the movie sets on the famous Backlot. It incorporated legendary movie locations such as the Court House from Back to the Future, the New York district, Western and Mexico regions, and an entire section that portrayed mid-century Europe. The locations provided the perfect backdrop for Luft’s creative team to present some of the finest air-cooled Porsche road and racing machinery, crafting photographic scenes from around the world.

The incredible success of Luft 6 – when the series first took over the Universal Studios Backlot – paired with the promise of an all-new experience made Luft 10 the biggest and most epic event in its ten-year history. More visitors attended than ever before, eager to discover more than 400 cars on display, including a number of legendary “hero” cars strategically placed to provide the perfect photo opportunity.

In addition to the main event, the Luftgekühlt team explored new territories in 2024. Taking the show across the Atlantic, they visited Wroclaw in Poland in June and Copenhagen in Denmark in September, recreating the elements that have made Luftgekühlt such a groundbreaking experience for North American audiences. Both European destinations were a huge success, reaching not only enthusiasts from Luft’s previous visits to Germany and the UK in 2018, but also introducing many new enthusiasts to the Porsche brand. A combination of curated “hero” cars, which included some from the Porsche Museum, and registered visitor display cars ensured visitors were exposed to an authentic Luftgekühlt experience on their doorstep.

On a smaller scale, the Luft team supported the Porsche Brand Store’s Saturday Tunes event in Stuttgart, Germany on September 28, where a number of historic air-cooled cars were presented in Luftgekühlt style in the center of Porsche’s hometown. The team similarly joined the Chattanooga Motorcar Festival on October 11-13 to showcase a mix of legendary Porsche heritage and motorsport cars in celebration of CMF’s grand marshall; legendary Le Mans, Indycar and F1 driver, David Hobbs. This year, the spotlight fell on the iconic Porsche 935 K4-01 Hobbs drove in the 1982 IMSA GT class. David made a special appearance and joined a panel discussion hosted by Bob Varsha. The event also featured a curated display of enthusiast’s air-cooled Porsches.

As if that wasn’t enough, one of the biggest adventures in 2024 for the Luft team was the introduction of its sister-brand, Air|Water. The first ever standalone event took place in Southern California in April after the show had previously existed as an extension of Luft 9 in San Francisco during 2023. While Luftgekühlt is dedicated to the early air-cooled Porsche models, Air|Water embraces both the air- and newer water-cooled Porsche models, allowing fans and owners of every Porsche model to attend and participate. With its inclusive model range and larger venue, Air|Water 2024 surprised visitors and organizers alike with its size and scope, promising a bright future for the new addition to the Luftgekühlt franchise.

Throughout its ten years and rapid expansion, Luftgekühlt has been supported by a number of dedicated partners, which have shared the ride and helped make the growth possible. The entire Luft team, led by co-founder Patrick Long and Creative Director Jeff Zwart, would like to thank the partners, fans, followers and car owners for their shared belief; and invite everybody to continue the journey together.

Planning for the 2025 season is well underway and the throttle will remain wide open as we race into the new year. More details will be released in due course but Luft fans can look forward to the Holiday Collection, which will be released next month.
