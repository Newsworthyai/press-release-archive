# Soccersm Deploys AI-Assisted Prediction Markets on Lisk Protocol

Lisk, a leading Layer 2 blockchain dedicated to bringing Ethereum to emerging markets, is announcing its partnership with Soccersm, a decentralized AI prediction markets platform. Soccersm will deploy its AI-assisted prediction markets on the Lisk protocol under a beta program alongside a beta launch of some of its newest features, with plans for a full mainnet launch by the early Q1 2025. Lisk is the first project from the Optimism Superchain to introduce a prediction market on its protocol.

Soccersm stands out in the prediction market landscape by integrating AI to assist users in making informed decisions when placing bets. The platform features P2P Betting, also known as Challenge Pools, which is a decentralized betting pool allowing users to stake against each other on the outcome of future events. Additionally, the AI Prediction Agent provides pre-match predictions and recommendations for smarter betting.

With over 65,000 users already on its platform, Soccersm is set to leverage Lisk's technology and expand its reach within the thriving Optimism Superchain ecosystem. The platform also offers exciting Casino Games, including the unique Balls Game, Wheel of Treasures, and Raffles, providing fun and profit opportunities for users.

"The deployment of Soccersm is a significant step in our evolution,” said Dominic Schwenter, COO of Lisk. “While other platforms have shown the appetite for prediction markets, Lisk will work with the Soccersm team to offer a fully decentralized, permissionless alternative. As a result, we will continue to build a community where users can create and trade prediction markets without relying on centralized intermediaries. I'm excited to see the diverse range of markets our users will establish, from sports outcomes to politics and economic indicators."

"We are choosing to deploy exclusively on Lisk because of the protocol's commitment to building in emerging markets like Africa," said Baah Kusi, Co-Founder of Soccersm. "With Lisk, we have greater opportunities to grow and tap into a community eager for innovative prediction market solutions."

The partnership between Lisk and Soccersm is poised to drive increased volume and interest in the Lisk ecosystem, providing better access and assistance for individuals looking to participate in prediction markets.
