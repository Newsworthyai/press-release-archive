Designed for Power, Built for Comfort

The Mooncool TK1 Pro is engineered with a 1500-watt peak motor to provide unparalleled torque and speed, ideal for riders tackling both city streets and challenging inclines. Complementing this power is a redesigned 48V, 20Ah lithium battery, offering a significant 38% increase in amp hours over its predecessor and delivering a range of up to 75 miles. This makes the TK Pro the ideal choice for those seeking an electric trike that can go the distance without compromising performance.

Features that Matter

Beyond its impressive power, the TK Pro is also crafted with rider comfort in mind. Its step-through frame sits just 12.2 inches from the ground, providing easy mounting for riders of all ages. Equipped with a hydraulic suspension fork, wide Kenda tires, and a well-padded comfort seat with backrest, the TK Pro ensures a smooth and comfortable ride. For added utility, Mooncool includes sturdy front and rear baskets, offering ample storage without additional cost.

Safety and Control at Every Turn

The TK Pro isn’t just powerful; it’s safe. Featuring StarUnion 180mm hydraulic disc brakes, riders can count on reliable stopping power even on steep descents. Additionally, the e-trike includes a parking brake, rear differential mechanism for stable turns, turn signals, and a horn, all designed to enhance rider safety and visibility.

Precision Quality with Elite Quality Control

Mooncool’s attention to quality is evident throughout the TK Pro. Mooncool is one of the few e-trike brands with the ability to closely monitor production, ensuring that each unit meets the brand’s stringent standards.
