# The Future of Medicine: Key Biotech Stocks to Watch

In today's rapidly advancing healthcare landscape, biotech companies are playing a crucial role in addressing some of the most challenging medical conditions. With a focus on innovation and precision, these companies are developing next-generation treatments and therapies that offer new hope for patients and present compelling opportunities for investors.

Unlike many traditional sectors, biotech operates at the cutting edge of science and technology, often driving significant progress in areas such as targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and genetic research. As these companies push forward with their groundbreaking work, they not only stand to revolutionize patient care but also present promising prospects for those looking to invest in the future of medicine.

Let’s take a closer look at four biotech companies making waves in the industry.

OS Therapies, Inc. (NYSE-A: OSTX)

OS Therapies, Inc. (NYSE-A: OSTX) is carving out a unique position in the oncology landscape with its innovative approaches to treating cancer. The company, still in its clinical stage, focuses on developing therapies for osteosarcoma and other solid tumors. Their flagship product, OST-HER2, utilizes a novel immunotherapy platform that leverages the immune-boosting properties of Listeria bacteria to target the HER2 protein—a key player in several cancers.

The company's pipeline includes OST-HER2, an immunotherapy currently in a Phase 2b trial targeting resected, recurrent osteosarcoma. With the trial fully enrolled and results expected in the fourth quarter of 2024, investors are keenly awaiting data that could significantly impact the stock’s trajectory. OST-HER2 has already garnered notable designations such as Fast-Track, Orphan Drug, and Rare Pediatric Disease from the FDA, underscoring its potential to address unmet medical needs.

In addition to OST-HER2, OSTX is advancing its tunable Antibody Drug Conjugate (tADC) platform. This next-generation technology employs pH-sensitive silicon-based linkers, known as SiLinkers, designed to deliver multiple therapeutic agents directly to tumors, minimizing harm to healthy cells. Early preclinical data from this platform shows promise, positioning OS Therapies as a company with innovative solutions that could transform cancer treatment.

Recent milestones further highlight the company’s growth potential. OSTX successfully raised $6.4 million in its initial public offering (IPO) on July 31, 2024. This funding not only bolsters their financial position but also supports ongoing and upcoming clinical trials. Additionally, the company has entered into Johnson & Johnson Innovation – JLABS, which could enhance its development capabilities and expand its research network.

Financially, OSTX has made significant strides. The conversion of outstanding preferred shares and debt into equity, alongside the successful IPO, positions OS Therapies with a solid cash runway extending into mid-2025. This financial stability is critical as they approach key clinical milestones and seek further regulatory approvals.

On August 2, 2024, OS Therapies announced the formation of a Patient Advocacy Advisory Board (PAAB) dedicated to its osteosarcoma program. The PAAB, composed of key figures from the osteosarcoma community, including Miriam Cohen (Osteosarcoma Collaborative) and Mac Tichenor (Osteosarcoma Institute), will provide valuable insights and feedback as the company seeks regulatory approvals for OST-HER2. This board will meet quarterly to review clinical progress and guide discussions with the FDA regarding a potential Biologics License Authorization (BLA).

Additionally, on August 6, 2024, OS Therapies introduced its Scientific and Medical Advisory Board (SMAB). This board includes leading experts in osteosarcoma from institutions such as Texas Children’s Hospital and the Cleveland Clinic. The SMAB will support the company in evaluating OST-HER2’s safety and efficacy compared to current standards of care, playing a crucial role in the company’s regulatory strategy and potential BLA submission.

OS Therapies’ approach to addressing significant cancer challenges through its innovative platforms presents an intriguing opportunity for investors. With strong initial results, a promising pipeline, and a strategic partnership with JLABS, the company is well-positioned for future growth. For those looking to invest in a company at the forefront of cancer immunotherapy and antibody drug conjugates, OSTX offers a compelling proposition.

Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRBP)

CRBP is making notable strides in oncology with its innovative approach to addressing serious diseases. The company's diversified pipeline includes CRB-701, CRB-601, and CRB-913, each with unique mechanisms and promising potential.

Corbus’ lead asset, CRB-701, is a next-generation antibody drug conjugate (ADC) targeting Nectin-4. Recently presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Conference, the Phase 1 trial results have been promising. The study, conducted with CSPC Pharmaceuticals Group, is assessing CRB-701's safety and efficacy across multiple doses. Data through April 2024 reveals a 44% overall response rate and a 78% disease control rate in metastatic urothelial cancer, and a 43% ORR and 86% DCR in cervical cancer. The drug has been well tolerated, with manageable side effects including a few cases of skin rash and peripheral neuropathy, and no dose-limiting toxicities observed up to 4.5 mg/kg..

For the quarter ending June 30, 2024, Corbus reported a net loss of approximately $10.0 million, an increase from the previous year. This rise in loss is attributed to increased clinical trial costs for CRB-701 and drug manufacturing costs for CRB-913. The company ended the quarter with $147 million in cash, which, combined with recent fundraising, is expected to sustain operations through Q3 2027.

Corbus also appointed Winston Kung to its Board of Directors as of August 16, 2024. Kung’s extensive experience in both the pharmaceutical industry and investment banking is anticipated to provide valuable insights and guidance as Corbus advances its pipeline. The company also announced the resignation of Avery “Chip” Catlin from the Board, after over ten years of service.

Corbus Pharmaceuticals is advancing through significant clinical and corporate milestones. The encouraging data for CRB-701 and the progress in other pipeline assets position the company for potential growth. Continued development and forthcoming data releases will be crucial in determining the long-term impact of these promising therapies.

Puma Biotechnology, Inc. (NASDAQ: PBYI)

Puma Biotechnology is dedicated to advancing cancer treatment, with a focus on its lead drug, NERLYNX. Approved for HER2-positive breast cancer, NERLYNX has faced fluctuating sales performance. In Q2 2024, the drug generated $44.4 million in revenue, a 14% decrease from the previous year, but still managed to beat analyst expectations despite a sequential decline of 24.2%. The product’s total prescriptions rose by 3% sequentially but fell 14% year-over-year.

In addition to NERLYNX, Puma is developing alisertib, an aurora kinase A inhibitor. This drug, licensed from Takeda in 2022, is being evaluated in several trials. The Phase I/Ib study presented at the 2024 ASCO Annual Meeting demonstrated alisertib’s potential when combined with osimertinib for treating osimertinib-resistant EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study showed an 81% disease control rate and a median progression-free survival of 5.5 months. Notably, alisertib was more effective in patients with TP53 wild-type mutations, prompting Puma to adjust the trial focus accordingly.

PBYI reported a net loss of $4.53 million for Q2 2024, a stark contrast to the profit of the same quarter last year. The drop in revenue and increased operating costs have been concerns, though the company’s revenues from NERLYNX and royalties met expectations.

Looking ahead, Puma’s pipeline, particularly the alisertib studies, could be pivotal in shaping its future performance. With trials like ALISCA-Lung1 for small cell lung cancer and the upcoming ALISCA-Breast1 study, Puma aims to address significant gaps in cancer treatment. While current financials reflect challenges, the potential breakthroughs in its pipeline offer a promising outlook for long-term growth.

Actinium Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NYSE-A: ATNM)

ATNM focuses on targeted radiotherapies for oncology patients who have not responded to conventional treatments. Its primary products, Iomab-B and Actimab-A, are aimed at treating relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), offering substantial growth potential if the company’s clinical trials continue to yield positive results.

The company's most advanced candidate, Iomab-B, is in a Phase 3 SIERRA trial for AML patients undergoing bone marrow transplants. Despite a setback regarding its Biologics License Application (BLA), where the FDA requested an additional randomized trial, Iomab-B has shown promising results. The SIERRA trial met its primary endpoint of durable complete remission (dCR) with a p-value of less than 0.0001. This success places Actinium in a strong position, though further validation through additional trials will be key to unlocking its full market potential.

Actimab-A, another late-stage candidate, is being tested as a targeted radiotherapy both as a single agent and in combination with other therapies for AML. These ongoing trials could drive stock performance, especially as the company expands its reach into various cancer therapies.

Additionally, Iomab-ACT, a newer agent, shows promise in the growing gene and cell therapy space. The targeted radiotherapy conditioning approach of Iomab-ACT could revolutionize how treatments like CAR-T and gene therapies are delivered. The CAR-T market, currently valued at over $3.5 billion in annual revenue, is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11%. If Iomab-ACT proves successful, it could capture a significant portion of this expanding market, potentially contributing blockbuster-level revenue by 2030.

Actinium’s intellectual property portfolio supports this potential, with patent protection for Iomab-B and Iomab-ACT extending until 2040. The company’s ability to further develop these products, particularly in collaboration with institutions like Columbia University, presents a compelling investment case as it seeks to expand into high-demand areas like sickle cell disease and stem cell therapies.
