# Flash ‘Puts Parking on the Map’ with Google Search, Google Maps, and Now Waze

Flash today announced the full U.S. release of reservable parking transactions in Waze that Flash developed in collaboration with the popular navigation app. Waze joins Google Search and Google Maps in Flash’s growing portfolio of integrations which features parking options with Flash across all three major platforms, including many of the world’s largest parking operators and owners.

Together, Flash and Waze set a new standard for how drivers find and pay for parking at 30,000 parking locations in North America. When drivers enter their destinations in Waze, the app now suggests nearby reservable parking locations. Drivers can see important details for selecting their preferred parking location such as cost, amenities, wheelchair-accessibility and valet options. Drivers can reserve and pay for the parking location they choose, and Waze will route them to the selected parking destination where they can access the parking facility with a digital pass.

“Driver behaviors and expectations are shifting, and our efforts to embed reservable parking and charging experiences with leading apps and platforms anticipated that shift,” said Dan Roarty, Chief Digital Officer at Flash. “We can help parking asset owners and operators meet drivers in the apps and sites where they plan their travel and bring an end to the era of circling blocks, wasting time and fuel in the search for parking.”

Early results prove that allowing drivers to book parking directly in the search and navigation apps they use most is a win for parking owners and operators. Over 90 percent of these drivers are new customers to the parking locations. They make Google parking reservations 8.5 hours in advance and at a median distance of 22.3 miles away from their destination. These customers plan ahead through digital services and trust the navigation apps they already use.

“This is an exciting time in the parking industry as Flash continues to partner with Parkway to make our customer experience more seamless and integrated than ever,” said Robert Zuritsky, Parkway President and CEO. “Parkway is thrilled to see reservable parking at our locations made available through these services. Flash understands our business and continually innovates to deliver new channels and capabilities that drive additional customers and transactions to us.”

Flash’s integrations with Waze, Google Search and Google Maps unify operators’ availability and pricing data and performance metrics across these Google properties. These properties join Flash’s growing integration footprint alongside existing relationships with Ticketmaster, hundreds of major event venues and automakers like Mercedes Benz and Hyundai. Flash’s flexible developer tools and payment configurations support the integration of Flash experiences into a wide range of interfaces, from desktop and mobile browsers to mobile apps, connected car dashboards and enterprise applications for employee parking and fleets.
