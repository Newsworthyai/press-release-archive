Los Defensores, the first nationwide brand dedicated to connecting the Latino community with qualified legal services, marked its 40th Anniversary Gala on August 15, 2024, at the renowned Petersen Automotive Museum. Close to 300 guests attended the event, which featured a special tribute to MLB Hall of Famer Jaime Jarrín, the iconic Spanish-language voice of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and his son Jorge Jarrin; both official spokesmen for the brand.

At the event, the Jaime and Blanca Jarrin Foundation raised over $9,000 for its scholarship program, which supports underprivileged students pursuing degrees in law, communications, or journalism. Los Defensores matched this contribution, bringing the total raised to an impressive $18,000.

In line with its deep-rooted commitment to corporate social responsibility, Los Defensores introduced its bold new community initiative, “Siempre Contigo” (Always On Your Side). This innovative program will enhance the company’s ongoing community empowerment and social responsibility efforts. Through year-round outreach, education, and expanded philanthropic activities, “Siempre Contigo” will make a lasting impact on local communities.

The evening brought together an array of distinguished guests, including legendary labor leader and civil rights activist Dolores Huerta, who co-founded the United Farm Workers Union with Cesar Chavez, and retired California Supreme Court Justice and former U.S. Ambassador to Belize, Carlos Moreno. Other VIPs included radio and TV personality Gisselle Bravo, who hosted the event; Said Garcia, producer, and on-air radio and TV personality; Hazel Ortega, motivational speaker and author of “From Bounced Checks to Private Jets;” Liliana Perez, senior director of cultural affairs for the Los Angeles Chargers; as well as representatives from LA County Supervisor Janice Hahn, California State Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi, and LA City Councilwoman Katy Yaroslavsky, who presented Certificates of Recognition during the program.

Jaime Jarrín, celebrated as a trailblazer in sports broadcasting, was honored for his 39 years of service as the longest-running spokesperson for Los Defensores in the national Hispanic media market. Since 1985, Jaime and his son, Jorge Jarrín, have become beloved figures in the Latino community through their legendary Spanish-language television ads for Los Defensores, cementing their place in the community’s history and pop culture.

“We are thrilled to celebrate the enduring success and legacy of Los Defensores alongside our dedicated employees and the attorneys from across the United States serving our community.
