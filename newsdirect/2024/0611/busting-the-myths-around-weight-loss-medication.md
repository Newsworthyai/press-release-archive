# Busting the Myths Around Weight Loss Medication

Obesity is one of the most common chronic health issues in the U.S. today, and can lead to or exacerbate many other significant physical and mental health challenges, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease and depression. But GLP-1 injections are an impactful new tool that can help people on their weight loss journey.

Recently, Dr. Craig Primack, the Senior Vice President of Weight Loss at Hims and Hers, participated in a nationwide satellite media tour to discuss the impact of obesity, common myths surrounding weight loss medications, and personalized options that can help.

Research shows that even just 5-10% of body weight loss can improve blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol, joint pain, sleep apnea, and other weight-related conditions. Weight loss drugs like GLP-1 medication are not only an exciting tool in the weight loss tool belt but can help to address the challenges associated with obesity. GLP-1 injections can support healthy weight loss along with a reduced calorie diet and increased exercise.

Some common myths regarding weight loss medications, include:

● Many people assume that weight loss medications are magic. Weight loss drugs can be excellent tools for decreasing hunger and therefore reducing overall calorie intake, but their effects are not instant and should be combined with a healthy lifestyle approach, including a balanced diet and regular exercise.

● People also assume that the injections are painful. The injection is a very small needle that goes just under the skin. It feels like a small pinch, and is quite painless. For the most part, people do great with self-administering GLP-1 injections.

● Lastly, many people think that weight loss drugs come with dangerous side effects. Like all medications, there is a risk of side effects, but there are really only three common side effects associated with GLP-1’s, and they are generally mild: nausea, heartburn, and constipation. The benefits of these drugs far outweigh the risks for many, especially when compared to the health risks associated with being overweight. Hims & Hers’ personalized approach means custom treatment for individual needs to minimize these side effects.

Known for its holistic, personalized approach to health and wellness, Hims & Hers is now offering access to GLP-1 injections designed for affordability and effectiveness. These are the four things you should know.
