BELLAMI, the #1 hair extensions brand, globally, announces the launch of ‘The Ponytail’ in collaboration with celebrity hairstylist and long-time brand fan, Andrew Fitzsimons. With BELLAMI’s deep-rooted expertise in innovating high quality, luxury hair extensions and Fitzsimons’ aptitude for styling Hollywood’s elite including Jennifer Lopez, Kim and Khloe Kardashian, Megan Fox and more, the duo has perfected this season’s biggest hair accessory: high-fashion, statement ponytails.

“I’ve been using BELLAMI hair extensions on my clients for years, and I’ve always been impressed by their superior quality. It is unmatched,” says Fitzsimons. “That’s why collaborating with BELLAMI to develop ‘The Ponytail’ was a natural choice; it can elevate any style within minutes, and it’s not just for celebrities - it’s accessible to everyone.”

BELLAMI and Fitzsimons’ new ready-to-wear ponytail collection is made of 100% Remy human hair, ensuring long-lasting durability. The high-quality hair works well with styling products and hot tools to achieve a variety of looks ranging from a sleek and polished wet ponytail to a voluminous teased updo and beyond. “The Ponytail” is designed to flawlessly blend with your natural hair while adding length and density. Each ponytail features an inside comb that easily secures the ponytail for maximum comfort without drooping. Whether for a special occasion or weekend getaway, ‘The Ponytail’ is the perfect accessory to enhance your look in under five minutes.

“From social media to the streets, red carpet looks to the latest fashion trends, ponytails are everywhere, and extensions can make this look effortless and sophisticated,” says Laure Murciano, BELLAMI VP of Marketing. “Like BELLAMI, Andrew is committed to providing consumers with superior tools to help them achieve professional looks, like those he creates for his celebrity clientele. With our expertise and craftsmanship and Andrew’s creativity and styling aptitude, we have brought the ponytail trend to the forefront with these fun and easy-to-use ponytail extensions that are both accessible and high-impact.”

The collection boasts 23 highly dimensional shades for seamless color matching for all hair colors, in 20” and 24” lengths to deliver an everyday snatched look or red carpet glam.
