# Voyageur Pharmaceuticals and Rain Cage Carbon Partner to Develop Advanced Radiology Contrast Agents

Voyageur Pharmaceuticals CEO Brent Willis joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce that the company and Rain Cage Carbon are advancing their collaboration following the first commercial creation of a V@C60 endohedral fullerene or Vanadium atom inside a C60 molecule. Rain Cage is now embarking on the next phase of radiology drug development using their cutting-edge technology.

Willis told Proactive that Rain Cage will begin working to create on a commercial scale, the encapsulation of gadolinium, bismuth, and iodine within endohedral fullerenes. This pioneering work, set to begin later this month, aims to develop a process to create Gd@C60, Bi@C60, and I@C60 endohedral fullerenes, targeting the development of highly advanced radiology contrast agents for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and CT scans. These novel compounds, known for their rarity and complex synthesis, hold the promise of transforming medical imaging by significantly enhancing the precision and clarity of radiological scans.

Endohedral fullerenes are a class of fullerenes that enclose an additional atom, ion, or cluster within their inner sphere, exhibiting superior physical and electronic characteristics compared to regular fullerenes. In the context of radiology drugs, endohedral metallofullerenes offer distinct advantages through exceptional stability and bioavailability, an amplified signal that leads to better image clarity and resolution, targeted delivery, and reduced toxicity. These properties have garnered interest in applications such as MRI contrast agents
