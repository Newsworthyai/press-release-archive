# Lava Cake is the top cannabis strain on the market, new poll finds

Lava Cake is the cannabis strain whose effects are most popular with consumers, according to new consumer polling and analysis conducted by NuggMD, the leading telehealth platform for cannabis.

The poll asked cannabis users their main goal for using cannabis, desired flavor/aroma, and desired effect. More than 6,500 randomized cannabis users responded. As a representative sample of all U.S. cannabis consumers, the poll’s margin of error is 1.2%.

The top preferences respondents cited were: the goal of pain relief (25%), anxiety relief (23%), and stress relief (18%); a flavor profile of fruit (27%), sweetness (19%), and earthiness (18%); and the effects of relaxation (30%) and euphoria (24%). The full poll results are available here.

The company then used its database of cannabis strains to identify popular strains that fit those preferences. While strains like Georgia Pie, Cheetah Piss, Mendo Breath, and GMO Cookies rank highly, Lava Cake is the only strain that meets all of those preferences, suggesting it is both the most durable strain on the market and the one that offers the most effects that consumers want.

The poll also finds nearly half of all cannabis users hit it whenever they feel like it—the poll asked respondents when they prefer to consume cannabis, with a plurality, 48 percent, saying “anytime.”

“Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, Americans have become much more stressed out and anxious than previous generations, and I don’t think it’s a coincidence to see everyday Americans doing whatever they can to manage it all,” said Deb Tharp, head of legal and policy research at NuggMD. “Our polling data suggests that more Americans are using cannabis to mentally and emotionally handle the world around them than to escape from it.”

NuggMD.com used first-party data to conduct this poll. It was a questionnaire sent via email to a random list of opt-in respondents, all of whom consume cannabis regularly. The poll was conducted in May 2024. The sample contained no NuggMD customers.
