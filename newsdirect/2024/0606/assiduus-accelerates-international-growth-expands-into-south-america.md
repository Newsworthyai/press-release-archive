# Assiduus Accelerates International Growth, Expands into South America

Assiduus, a renowned innovator and leader in multi-market ecommerce distribution, has announced its expansion into South America.

With the expansion, Assiduus expects to capitalize on the region's booming ecommerce market and empower non-LatAm brands to reach millions of potential customers across South America.

Despite being a rapidly growing market, South America remains under-penetrated for non-regional brands. However, Assiduus believes there is a huge appetite for international brands, particularly those of US origin.

Market data suggests that ecommerce sales in Latin America are expected to rise to $160 billion by 2025. With the current growth rate, others are even more bullish, forecasting the surge to be up to $200 billion by the end of 2025. Hence, Assiduus does not just look forward to entering another market but also to opening up a unique opportunity for brands globally.

Founder and CEO of Assiduus, Somdutta Singh, is confident that this expansion will be a game-changer for brands in the region and play a pivotal role in Assiduus’ growth trajectory. By establishing a presence in South America, the company looks forward to expanding its client offerings and base and solidifying its position as the leading global ecommerce accelerator: “South America represents a vibrant landscape for ecommerce. We're excited to empower brands and entrepreneurs with the opportunity to grow their business with Assiduus and deliver great value and a convenient shopping experience for customers across South America. We’re providing our industry-leading expertise to brands, enabling them to navigate complexities like global logistics and fulfillment, access to buyer data and analytics, marketplace and inventory optimization across global platforms. This empowers brands to focus on what they do best – creating exceptional products for global audiences.”

Assiduus also looks forward to benefiting South American consumers by facilitating access to a wider variety of quality products. Their commitment to facilitating a smooth shopping experience ensures a convenient journey for customers across the region, making it easier than ever to discover and purchase their desired brands.
