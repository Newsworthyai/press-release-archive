# Black Radiance Launches Beautyverse App as First Step into Beauty Tech Space

Black Radiance, one of the first inclusive beauty brands, is excited to launch its first augmented reality app, Beyond Radiant. Available now in all app stores, Beyond Radiant empowers women of color with the confidence to be their best selves by seeing the unlimited possibilities in the avatars.

Beyond Radiant stands at the intersection of augmented reality technology, beauty, and empowerment. Unlike traditional beauty apps that focus solely on makeup application, Beyond Radiant offers an immersive experience surrounding four diverse avatars, each with unique personalities and professions, to inspire women of color and foster a community of confident, empowered women who see themselves in the achievements and aspirations of the app’s avatar.

“Black Radiance has always stood on the cutting-edge of the intersection between beauty and race,” said Sherry West, Brand Marketing Manager at Black Radiance. “We know the way of the future is to embrace technology in new and unique ways, especially with the increasing presence of AI in the beauty industry. We’re excited to step into the future in an inclusive way that holds true to Black Radiance’s long-standing mission of empowering women of color.”

Beyond Radiant Augmented Reality avatars are inspired by history-making women who have blazed new paths for Black women, like NASA Astronaut Jessica Watkins, and record-breaking ice skater Starr Andrews. Jessica Watkins is the first Black woman to complete an International Space Station long-term mission, while Starr Andrews is the first African American woman to win a Grand Prix medal in the singles discipline. The dedication, creativity, imagination, and fortitude of these women can be seen in the four avatars: The Boss Babe, The Champ, The Content Creator, and The Innovator.

“In a world where beauty standards often feel limiting, Black Radiance dares to redefine what beauty can mean for women of color,” said K. Parris MacDonald, Vice President of Marketing at Black Radiance. “The Beyond Radiant App feels like a natural progression to further offering space to women of color to be their authentic selves and see themselves reflected in the narratives of achievement and success.”

The Beyond Radiant app is available to download in all app stores now and at www.blackradiancebeauty.com. For more information and updates, visit www.blackradiancebeauty.com/beyondradiant and follow @blackradiancebeauty on social media. Hi-res images and interviews are available upon request.
