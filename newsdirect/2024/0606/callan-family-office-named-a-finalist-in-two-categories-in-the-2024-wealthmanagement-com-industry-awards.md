Callan Family Office, a registered investment advisor serving ultra-high-net-worth families, family offices, foundations and endowments across the United States, today announced it has been named a Finalist in the WealthManagement.com 2024 Industry Awards for two categories.

Callan Family Office was named a finalist in the Family Office Client Initiative category, while Jack Ginter, Callan Family Office’s Chief Executive Officer, is a finalist for Chief Executive Officer of the Year for RIAs under $20 billion in assets under management.

“We are thrilled to be recognized by WealthManagement.com for the Wealthies, which are so well respected in our industry,” Ginter said. “We started this firm with the unique needs of family offices in mind, so this recognition is a validation of our place in the industry as an entrepreneurial and independent firm.

Now in its tenth year, the WealthManagement.com Industry Awards is the only awards program of its kind to honor outstanding achievements by companies, organizations and individuals that support financial advisor success. A panel of judges made up of top names in the industry, led by WealthManagement.com director of editorial strategy and operations David Armstrong, chose the finalists and will determine the winners, which each year recognizes the firms and individuals who are bringing new innovations to market that make a real difference to the daily activities of financial advisors.

Winners will be announced at a gala and awards ceremony in New York City on September 5th.
