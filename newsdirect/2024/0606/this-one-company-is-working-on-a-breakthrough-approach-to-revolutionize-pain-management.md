Autonomix Medical (NASDAQ: AMIX) is a medical device company dedicated to transforming the diagnosis and treatment of diseases or disorders related to the nervous system. At the core of Autonomix's innovative approach is a first-in-class technology platform featuring a catheter-based microchip sensing array. This technology boasts an unprecedented ability to detect and differentiate neural signals with up to 3,000 times greater sensitivity than existing technologies. This breakthrough has paved the way for transvascular diagnosis and treatment of nervous system diseases virtually anywhere in the body, offering a new horizon of medical possibilities and market opportunities.

Clinical Studies In Pancreatic Cancer PainAutonomix has initiated its first clinical study targeting pancreatic cancer pain, marking a significant milestone in its ongoing medical innovation. Pancreatic cancer represents a considerable unmet medical need, particularly concerning pain management. Effective solutions in this area are critically needed, as current relief options for pancreatic diseases are limited to drugs like opioids. In light of that, the initiation of these clinical studies represents a crucial step toward addressing this substantial healthcare challenge for suffering patients.

Market OpportunitiesIn addition to addressing the pain relief needs of patients, Autonomix’s technology presents significant market opportunities across various medical fields. By accurately targeting the nervous system, Autonomix aims to address unmet needs and improve treatments for a wide range of conditions including but not limited to:

* Pancreatic Cancer Pain: The successful application of Autonomix's technology in pancreatic cancer pain management would not only help pancreatic cancer patients find relief from pain but also unlocks significant market potential. Pancreatic cancer pain management is part of a $2.2 billion market for pancreatic cancer treatment.
* Chronic Pain: This market presents a significant opportunity estimated at $75 billion. Conditions such as lower back pain, pelvic pain, urinary tract pain, digestive disorders and other tumor-related pain are prevalent and often inadequately managed with current therapies, particularly opioids. Autonomix's technology offers the potential to significantly reduce or eliminate the dependence on opioids, providing a safer and more effective solution for chronic pain management.
* Cardiovascular Diseases: With a market opportunity estimated at $23 billion, Autonomix's technology could revolutionize the treatment of conditions like hypertension and cardiovascular disease. By targeting the nervous system's role in these diseases, more precise and effective treatments could be developed.
* Pulmonary Diseases: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is another area where Autonomix's technology could have a substantial impact. The market for COPD treatments is estimated to be around $18 billion with considerable growth ahead, driven by the need for more effective and less side-effect-prone therapies. Autonomix's approach could provide a new paradigm in managing this debilitating condition.

Meeting Unmet Needs with Innovative SolutionsCurrent drug therapies for many of these conditions often come with significant side effects and do not adequately address the underlying issues. Autonomix's technology offers a promising alternative by providing targeted, nerve-based treatments that could improve patient outcomes and quality of life. This innovative approach aligns with Autonomix's mission to dramatically enhance the lives of millions by enabling precise and effective nerve-targeted treatments. In doing so, Autonomix can both detect and ablate malfunctioning nerves in one simple procedure, effectively opening new treatment options in the field of electrophysiology.

The Full OpportunityAutonomix Medical sits at the forefront of a potential revolution in medical treatment for diseases driven by the nervous system. The company’s advanced technology platform not only offers hope for better management of pancreatic cancer pain, but also opens the door to addressing numerous other conditions with significant unmet need. By providing physicians with powerful new tools for diagnosis and treatment, Autonomix is poised to make a profound impact on the future of healthcare.

Autonomix is a medical device company focused on advancing innovative technologies to revolutionize how diseases involving the nervous system are diagnosed and treated. The Company’s first-in-class technology platform includes a catheter-based microchip sensing array that has the ability to detect and differentiate neural signals with approximately 3,000 times greater sensitivity than currently available technologies. We believe this will enable, for the first time ever, transvascular diagnosis and treatment of diseases involving the peripheral nervous system virtually anywhere in the body.We are initially developing our technology for pancreatic cancer pain, a condition that can cause debilitating pain and needs an effective solution. However, our technology constitutes a platform with the potential to address dozens of indications, including in cardiology, renal denervation and chronic pain management across a wide disease spectrum.
