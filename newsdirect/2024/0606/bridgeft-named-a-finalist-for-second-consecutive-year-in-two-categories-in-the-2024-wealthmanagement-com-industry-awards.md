# BridgeFT Named a Finalist for Second Consecutive Year in Two Categories in the 2024 WealthManagement.com Industry Awards

BridgeFT, a cloud-native, API-first wealth infrastructure software company that enables financial institutions, fintech innovators, and registered investment advisors to deliver better, data-driven outcomes for their clients, announced today that it has been named a Finalist in the WealthManagement.com 2024 Industry Awards for two categories.

BridgeFT is a finalist in the Innovation Platforms and Account Aggregation categories.

“Once again, we are so honored to be recognized for the innovations that BridgeFT has brought to the wealthtech marketplace in helping advisors and financial technology companies centralize critical client data to power differentiated applications throughout the wealth ecosystem,” said Joe Stensland, BridgeFT’s Chief Executive Officer. “The WealthManagement.com Industry Awards set the standard for highlighting the best in our industry, and we are thrilled to be recognized as finalists in these prestigious categories.”

BridgeFT’s WealthTech API is the industry’s first WealthTech-as-a-Service platform, offering an open API to AI and trade-ready multi-custodial data, advanced analytics, and application services. The WealthTech API eliminates the need for individual data feeds from a range of custodians and back-office providers, enabling wealth management firms and wealthtech application providers to create differentiated, next-generation wealth management applications.

Now in its tenth year, the WealthManagement.com Industry Awards is the only awards program of its kind to honor outstanding achievements by companies, organizations and individuals that support financial advisor success. A panel of judges made up of top names in the industry, led by WealthManagement.com director of editorial strategy and operations David Armstrong, chose the finalists and will determine the winners, which each year recognizes the firms and individuals who are bringing new innovations to market that make a real difference to the daily activities of financial advisors.

Winners will be announced at a gala and awards ceremony in New York City on September 5, 2024.

“The Industry Awards are a beacon, illuminating the trailblazers and innovators who are shaping the future of the financial services industry,” said David Armstrong, director of editorial strategy and operations. “They serve as a leading indicator of future activity, and as a barometer for the dynamic ecosystem of companies and organizations that empower, support and enable advisor success who are driving the industry forward.”
