# BioHarvest Sciences Hits Major Sales Milestone with VINIA seeing sales records

BioHarvest Sciences CEO Ilan Sobel joined Steve Darling from Proactive to announce a significant achievement: VINIAÂ®, the first commercialized product developed on the Botanical Synthesis platform, set a new record for monthly sales orders in May, reaching 1.98 million. This represents a remarkable 101% increase compared to May 2023.

During the interview, Sobel explained that the sales growth in BioHarvest's Products division was primarily driven by strong subscription rates for VINIA. The company's core nutraceutical capsule business saw significant growth, bolstered by additional "VINIA Inside" products, such as VINIA Superfood Coffee, part of the Hot Beverage lineup. This impressive sales performance underscores BioHarvest's successful Direct-to-Consumer sales strategy, which has consistently increased both the number of new customers and total subscribers.

Looking ahead, the company is planning several new marketing programs set to launch in early June. These initiatives, combined with additional VINIA products in the near-term pipeline and the ramp-up of its CDMO Services Business Unit, position BioHarvest for a robust second quarter in 2024. Revenue for this period is projected to be in the range of $5.7-6.0 million. Sobel expressed confidence in the company's growth trajectory, highlighting the expansion of their product offerings and the ongoing success of their strategic marketing efforts.

Furthermore, BioHarvest's investment in research and development continues to yield promising results, with new product innovations expected to further drive revenue and market penetration. The company's commitment to leveraging its unique Botanical Synthesis technology positions it as a leader in the nutraceutical space, offering high-quality, scientifically-backed products to a growing consumer base.

Sobel also touched on the importance of sustainability and environmental responsibility in BioHarvest's operations. The company's production methods are designed to be eco-friendly, minimizing waste and reducing the carbon footprint, aligning with the increasing consumer demand for sustainable and ethically produced products.
