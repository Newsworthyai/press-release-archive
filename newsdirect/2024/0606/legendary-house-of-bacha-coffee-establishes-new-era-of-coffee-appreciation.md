Bacha Coffee traces its origins back to 1910 and the Dar el Bacha, a palace hidden in the heart of the old city in Marrakech, Morocco. Nestled behind the millennia-old walls, a coffee room beckoned, shrouded in whispers of secrecy and graced by the likes of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill, filmmaker Charlie Chaplin, entertainer Josephine Baker and other cultural and political names of the day. Uniting over glittering pots of “coffee of Arabica”, the Bacha Coffee room offered an escape and was a secret oasis known for its style and beauty, but above all, for its coffee.

A Passion for Craftsmanship

Today, driven by a fervent commitment to excellence and a deep reverence for the art of coffee making, Bacha Coffee is dedicated to preserving the timeless traditions of coffee craftsmanship while embracing innovation to meet the evolving tastes of modern coffee connoisseurs.

Bacha Coffee offers a collection of more than 200 meticulously sourced Single-Origin, Fine Blended, Fine Flavoured, and naturally CO₂ Decaffeinated 100% Arabica coffees sourced from 35 countries around the world including Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Central and South America, the Caribbean, Asia, and beyond.

Bacha Coffee’s expertly trained Coffee Masters work with farmers to gather the best and freshest beans and then process them according to age-old traditional methods. Since each variety of coffee requires a different degree of roasting to bring out its unique taste profile, Bacha Coffee Masters hand-roast each harvest individually before gently air cooling them for the best taste and preservation. By sourcing coffee beans from diverse origins, Bacha Coffee celebrates the unique terroir and flavour characteristics of each region, offering customers an authentic taste that makes it a true haven for coffee lovers.

Spoilt for Choice

Discover the luxury of choice and 100% Arabica in every cup. The coffees available on BachaCoffee.com mirror the extensive list offered in their original boutique in Marrakech and around the world, and invite coffee lovers to venture beyond the familiar to try harvests from unique farms and provenance. Bacha Coffee’s retail selection includes loose beans as well as beautifully packaged coffees and single serve coffee bags. Loose beans can be purchased by weight and ground to the specifications of each customer, from 7 different grind sizes.

Consider the sought-after single origin Yirgacheffe Heirloom Coffee, a rare Ethiopian harvest that takes centre stage in the history of coffee. Grown at altitudes of over 6,500 feet above sea level, this unique varietal feature delicate notes of cane sugar, lemongrass, and bergamot. Combining two of the finest coffees in the world, Happy Arabia Coffee is a fine blended coffee that features a delicate acidity and rich flavours of red fruits, chocolate, and caramel. Fans of fine flavoured coffees may indulge in the 1910 Coffee, with aromas of freshly picked wild strawberries and jugs of cream perfect for a balmy summer’s day.
