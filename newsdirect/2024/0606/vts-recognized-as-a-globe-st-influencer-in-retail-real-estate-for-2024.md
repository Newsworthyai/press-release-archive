# VTS Recognized as a Globe St. Influencer in Retail Real Estate for 2024

VTS, the industry's only technology platform that unifies owners, operators, brokers, and their customers across the real estate ecosystem, today announced it has been recognized by GlobeSt. as a 2024 Influencer in Retail Real Estate. This marks VTS’ debut on the distinguished list and comes on the heels of VTS CEO Nick Romito and Chief Strategy Officer Ryan Masiello’s recognition as Influencers in Commercial Real Estate Technology by Globe St. earlier this year.

“At VTS, we strive to deliver tailored innovation that addresses critical industry needs and generates significant value for stakeholders across all sectors. The development of VTS Retail Solutions was a strategic response to provide the industry with a technology solution to manage portfolios and market spaces in the most effective way possible, providing landlords with a competitive edge as consumer behaviors evolved,” said Romito. “This accolade underscores the continuous evolution of VTS’ solutions to meet the needs of multiple sectors of the real estate industry, and we are proud to offer a leading technology solution specific to retail, which is experiencing a period of great momentum.”

VTS was recognized for its Retail Solutions offering, one of the first end-to-end leasing platforms designed specifically for retail landlords. With VTS Retail Solutions, landlords gain access to a comprehensive portfolio view, real-time tenant insights, automated leasing workflows, intelligence on growth opportunities, and the ability to target top tenants through VTS’ marketing module, VTS Market. This digital interface enables retail landlords to manage their operations with an elevated level of strategy and confidence, in turn bolstering the sector’s growth and resilience.

This year, Globe St. Real Estate Forum’s Influencer series spotlighted prominent individuals, leadership teams and organizations at the forefront of retail as the sector has emerged as a bright spot in commercial real estate. The professionals featured on this list have demonstrated excellence in navigating the retail real estate market, pioneered innovations and best practices to enhance customer experiences and leasing processes, and accelerated the business through omni-channel strategies.
