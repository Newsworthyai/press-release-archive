Cancer treatments have come a long way over the years, but there is a newer treatment that is providing even stage four cancer patients with a new lease on life.

The first CAR T-cell therapy was only approved in 2017, but it’s already having a significant impact in the cancer treatment market. The latest success story comes from Sandra Hajlo, who just became the first person in Manitoba to be declared cancer-free following CAR T-cell therapy.1

Initially diagnosed with stage four B-cell lymphoma in 2015, Hajlo underwent successful chemotherapy. However, eight years later, her cancer returned, leading to another battle with the disease. After a misdiagnosis of scoliosis, a CT scan revealed her cancer had come back.

Her oncologist recommended CAR T-cell therapy, a new treatment where T-cells are modified to target cancer cells, making her the first recipient of this therapy at CancerCare Manitoba.

Dr. David Szwajcer, Manitoba Blood & Marrow Transplant Director at CancerCare Manitoba, explained that the CAR T-cells are collected, sent to a U.S. facility for modification, and then reintroduced to the patient. Hajlo described the procedure as quick and straightforward, taking only 20 minutes.

After undergoing CAR T-cell therapy in December 2023, Hajlo learned in April 2024 that the treatment was successful, and she is cancer-free once again, expressing her gratitude for the second chance at life.

CAR T-cell therapy does not guarantee survival, with about half of the patients not responding,but it has shown promising results in many cases.

CERo Therapeutics Holdings (NASDAQ:CERO) is an innovative immunotherapy company seeking to advance the next generation of engineered T cell therapeutics. CERo Therapeutics is unrelated to CancerCare Manitoba and had no role in the CAR T-cell therapy described above. Nevertheless, CERo Therapeutics believes that the success of the CAR T-cell therapy in Manitoba may provide an indication of the potential for its proprietary CER-T (chimeric engulfment receptor) cell therapy.

CAR-T cell treatment has a steep price tag and some potential serious side effects including secondary cancer developing2 as well as cytokine release syndrome (CRS),3 which causes your immune system to go into overdrive and is potentially life threatening. CER-T cell therapy may provide a more cost-effective alternative with fewer side effects.

CERo Advances Innovative Cancer ImmunotherapyCERo Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CERO) developed CER-T cells to enhance efficiency and reduce side effects compared to traditional therapies by leveraging the body's natural tumor-fighting mechanisms. CER-T cells achieve this through direct tumor killing and by amplifying the body's anti-tumor immune response, and additionally by presenting cancer cell fragments to other immune cells, drawing these cells to attack the tumor.

Peer-reviewed data shows that CER-T cells have at least eight anticancer functions, offering potent, durable, and low-toxicity therapeutic benefits, with the capability to completely eliminate tumors. The company has validated these findings in 10 animal experiments, including a study on Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) published in March 2024.

CERo Therapeutics believes CER-T cells offer greater therapeutic potential than currently approved chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T) cell therapy, potentially targeting both hematological malignancies and solid tumors. The company plans to begin clinical trials for its lead product candidate, CER-1236, in 2024 for treating hematological malignancies.

CERo has been diligently completing pre-clinical studies and documentation necessary to initiate clinical trials after gaining approval from the FDA for its Investigational New Drug (IND) Application.

CERo Therapeutics Holdings, Inc., (NASDAQ:CERO) has successfully completed toxicity studies for CER-1236, a critical step before applying to the FDA for approval to begin human trials. With these studies showing that CER-1236 can be safely administered, the company is now focusing on ensuring safe manufacturing and finalizing its FDA application. Upon FDA acceptance, the company would be able to commence Phase 1 clinical trials, marking the start of the journey toward US approval and addressing unmet medical needs.

CERo plans to update shareholders on their progress, including presentations at investor conferences, potential growth of their intellectual property portfolio, and advancements in other programs beyond AML.
