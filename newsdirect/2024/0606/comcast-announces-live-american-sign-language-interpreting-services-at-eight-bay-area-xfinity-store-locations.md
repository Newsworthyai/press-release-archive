# Comcast Announces Live American Sign Language Interpreting Services at Eight Bay Area Xfinity Store Locations

As part of its ongoing commitment to digital inclusion and accessibility, Comcast today announced the availability of live American Sign Language (ASL) interpreting services at eight Xfinity Store Locations in the Greater Bay Area.

Customers who need ASL support can stop into any of the select Bay Area Xfinity Stores, where representatives will utilize ASL Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) to access a live interpreter provided by partner, Communication Service for the Deaf (CSD). The Retail Associate simply taps the app on the store iPad and is connected in moments via video to a live interpreter who can translate from ASL to English and vice versa as the customer and Associate converse.

“We’re proud to deliver an inclusive service solution that will help more customers better interact and engage with Retail Associates representing our Xfinity Products and Services, to provide them with a much better in-store experience,” said Thomas Wlodkowski, Comcast Vice President for Accessibility. “I’m also grateful to our partners in California — who are helping to close the digital divide for more members of our disabled community by working with us on a variety of digital equity initiatives.”

Comcast launched the ASL VRI service as a pilot in select stores last year; it is the first telecommunications retailer in the country to offer live, on-demand, remote ASL interpreting services in stores to better serve customers. The company is expanding the service to additional stores across the country this year.

The eight Xfinity Greater Bay Area stores that offer ASL VRI service include:

* San Jose: 1068 E. Brokaw Rd. # 50, San Jose, CA 95131
* Sunnyvale: 301 W. McKinley Ave. Suite 140, Sunnyvale, CA 94086
* San Jose: 1566 Monterey Hwy #20, San Jose, CA 95110
* San Jose: 1600 Saratoga Ave., San Jose, CA 95129
* Palo Alto: 2825 El Camino Real #100, Palo Alto, CA 94306
* Fremont: 43325 Christy St., Fremont, CA 94538
* Oakland: 3070 E. 9th St., Oakland, CA 94601
* Dublin: 4104 Grafton St., Dublin, CA 94568

“As part of California School for the Deaf’s mission, we are deeply committed to providing a language rich environment that maximizes communication access in order for our students to lead fulfilling lives,” said Amy Novotny, Superintendent, California School for the Deaf. “Access to technology and connectivity builds confidence and independence, and that’s why we are excited to partner with Comcast on opportunities to close the digital divide for members of our Deaf and hard of hearing community.”

The American Community Survey (ACS) estimates that 3.6% of the U.S. population is “deaf or have serious difficulty hearing.” Additionally, according to Pew Research Center, 23% of people with disabilities say they never go online, with 57% saying they do not have a home broadband connection. That’s why, through its Project UP initiative, Comcast is working to address and eliminate the unique barriers to connectivity through a series of efforts, including Internet Essentials, Lift Zones, and skill development and training.

In addition to announcing this inclusive retail experience for customers, Comcast donated $60,000 in digital equity grants to community partners, San Francisco LightHouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired, California School for the Deaf, and the World Institute on Disability. These grants aim to broaden the scope of digital inclusion and accessibility to students, families, seniors, and community members.

“Assistive technologies are opening doors to greater independence for folks with a range of disabilities,” said Sharon Giovinazzo Chief Executive Officer of the San Francisco LightHouse of the Blind and Visually Impaired. “These innovations truly can level the playing field. Comcast has been a valued partner in delivering technologies and supporting our efforts to promote independence, community, and equity for blind and low vision people.”

“Diversity, equity and inclusion are the guiding stars of what we do here at the World Institute on Disability, and it is gratifying to see partners, such as Comcast, who also believe that equity and accessibility go hand-in-hand,” said Marcie Roth, Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer, World Institute on Disability. “Technology continues to evolve rapidly, and we must continue to work together to invest in solutions, which will help support people with disabilities having equal and greater access to products and services in today’s world as well as laying the foundation for greater accessibility for future generations.”
