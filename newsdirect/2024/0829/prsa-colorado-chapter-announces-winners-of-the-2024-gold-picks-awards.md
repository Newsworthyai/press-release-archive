# PRSA Colorado Chapter Announces Winners of the 2024 Gold Picks Awards

The Colorado Chapter of the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA Colorado) hosted its highly anticipated 2024 Gold Picks Awards Ceremony last night at Stick and Feather in Denver, Colo. The event, which has become a cornerstone of the Colorado public relations community, celebrated the outstanding achievements of professionals and organizations in the field of public relations and corporate communications.

Honoring Two Pioneers

A highlight of the evening was the presentation of Special Awards, including the Jane Dvorak Mentor of the Year Award and the Sharon Linhart PR Person of the Year Award. These awards were renamed at the event in honor of two trailblazers in the Colorado PR community, recognizing their extraordinary contributions to the industry. The 2024 Special Awards winners are:

* Joe Fuentes Rookie of the Year: Caroline Campbell, VISIT DENVER
* Jane Dvorak Mentor of the Year Award: Shawna Seldon McGregor, Maverick Public Relations
* Media Person of the Year: Greg Avery, Denver Business Journal

* PR Team of the Year: Gomez Howard Group
* Ayers Chapter Service Award: Liz Viscardi, APR, LV Events and PR
* Sharon Linhart PR Person of the Year Award: Merideth Hartung, B Public Relations

Rising Stars and Industry Leaders

The event also shone a spotlight on the next generation of PR professionals. Members of the Public Relations Student Society of America (PRSSA) from the University of Colorado Boulder and Colorado State University were acknowledged for their contributions to the event and their dedication to the profession. The PRSSA's efforts in fundraising and their anticipated participation in the ICON conference in Anaheim, Calif. this fall were particularly commended.

2024 Gold Picks Award Winners

All award winners are listed below under their corresponding category. Gold Picks are the highest-scoring awards based on a specific scoring system but each award is judged individually instead of against the other submittals within that category, meaning multiple organizations can win a Gold Pick within the same category. All awards are judged anonymously by another chapter of PRSA.
