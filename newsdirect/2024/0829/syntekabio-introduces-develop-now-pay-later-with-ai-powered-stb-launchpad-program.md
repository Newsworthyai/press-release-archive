Syntekabio (KOSDAQ: 226330), an artificial intelligence (AI) based drug development company, today announced its innovative new offer designed to minimize risk, save time and costs, and increase the success rate of companies developing novel therapies.

The new ‘Develop Now, Pay Later’ offer is Syntekabio’s latest initiative to invest in the success of its clients. This model enables pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to test the validity of a target protein of interest without incurring any upfront costs. Should a project demonstrate viability, Syntekabio then employs its STB LaunchPad program, powered by its proprietary AI-driven DeepMatcher® technology platform, to deliver hits and optimized leads as well as IND-enabled candidates.

Jongsun Jung, PhD, CEO of Syntekabio, remarked, “We want our clients to achieve their goal of bringing safer and more effective therapies to patients. Thus, our mission at Syntekabio is to deliver to our clients first-in-class or best-in-class compounds, fast. We strongly believe in the capability of our technology and so, to further invest in our clients’ success, we have introduced our Develop Now, Pay Later model to support groundbreaking drug development work and reduce the risk for our clients at the outset.”

Syntekabio is dedicated to making drug discovery as optimized and as low risk as possible. Clients can first take advantage of a complimentary feasibility study to determine if their project is viable. The next step is to submit any target protein for analysis via the STB LaunchPad program. There are no upfront fees. The client only pays for the work once the agreed upon validated results are obtained.

Syntekabio’s AI accesses over 10 billion known compounds as well as 1,400 in vitro/in vivo compatible drug targets covering over 70% of human diseases. This technology is powered by Syntekabio’s AI Bio-Supercom Center, which houses an immense infrastructure of 5,000 servers, 40,000 CPU cores, and 2,500 GPUs fueling the Company’s algorithms. The Company has a comprehensive suite of advanced proprietary tools designed to accelerate the drug discovery and development process.
