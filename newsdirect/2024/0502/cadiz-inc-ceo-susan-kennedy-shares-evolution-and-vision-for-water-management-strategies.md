# Cadiz Inc. CEO Susan Kennedy Shares Evolution and Vision for Water Management Strategies

--News Direct--

Cadiz Inc CEO Susan Kennedy joined Steve Darling from Proactive to to discuss the company's remarkable evolution and advancements in water management strategies. Initially established around two decades ago with a focus on leveraging land and water assets for public storage, Cadiz Inc. has since transformed into a prominent player in the global water industry. Today, the company oversees a portfolio of water assets valued at over $5 billion and aims to emerge as the largest water trading bank in the southwestern United States.

Central to Cadiz Inc.'s operations is its ownership of a vast aquifer system located in the eastern Mojave Desert. This aquifer, estimated to hold between 30 to 50 million acre feet of waterâ€”more than double the capacity of Lake Mead, serves as a crucial but complex water resource, situated hundreds of feet underground.

Kennedy underscored the ongoing challenges posed by climate change, particularly the diminishing snowpack, a traditional source of water replenishment. In response, Cadiz Inc. has adapted by acquiring strategic infrastructure such as pipelines and right-of-ways, enabling efficient management and transportation of its substantial water resources.

Moreover, the company has successfully navigated through extensive regulatory processes and litigations, positioning itself for significant public partnerships and infrastructure projects. These initiatives are geared towards bolstering water security and addressing the escalating demand for resilient water management solutions in the face of climate variability.

Cadiz Inc.'s transformation underscores its commitment to innovative water management practices, aiming to meet the evolving needs of communities while mitigating the impacts of climate change on water resources.
