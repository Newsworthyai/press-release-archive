--News Direct--

ToolsGroup, a global leader in retail and supply chain planning and optimization software, is thrilled to announce that it has been recognized as a Leader in seven separate G2 Spring 2024 reports. This achievement underscores ToolsGroup’s commitment to excellence and innovation in the supply chain industry.

“We feel honored that so many of our customers have publicly shared their experience with ToolsGroup’s solutions,” said Kevin Young, CMO and Chief Growth Officer at ToolsGroup. “Our customers’ success is our success. At a time when disruptions and uncertainties have become the norm, it is truly gratifying that our AI-driven supply chain solutions are helping brands around the world maximize their service levels while minimizing inventory and working capital investments, regardless of the complexity of their supply chain or the amount of uncertainty.”

Across all report categories, just 10% of all listed vendors made it to the G2 Spring reports, and less than 4% of products and services earn Leader recognition.

Based on a wealth of direct customer reviews, ToolsGroup earned recognition as a Leader in the following reports:

· Grid® Report for Supply Chain Planning | Spring 2024

· Europe Regional Grid® Report for Supply Chain Planning | Spring 2024

· EMEA Regional Grid® Report for Supply Chain Planning | Spring 2024

· Grid® Report for Demand Planning | Spring 2024

· Europe Regional Grid® Report for Demand Planning | Spring 2024

· EMEA Regional Grid® Report for Demand Planning | Spring 2024

To qualify for inclusion in the Supply Chain Planning category, a product must provide planning tools for demand, inventory, replenishment and ordering, facilitate delivery schedules and load planning, and customize plans based on individual business priorities.

Solutions in the Demand Planning category must produce reliable forecasts by extracting key insights from metrics like inventory trackers, converting raw data into actionable forecasts, supporting automation and leveraging predictive analysis.
