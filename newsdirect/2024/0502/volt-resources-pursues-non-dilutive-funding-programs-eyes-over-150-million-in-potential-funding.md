# Volt Resources Pursues Non-Dilutive Funding Programs, Eyes Over 150 Million in Potential Funding

--News Direct--

Volt Resources CEO Prashant Chintawar joined Steve Darling from Proactive to share significant developments in the company's operations for the first quarter of 2024. One of the key highlights is the successful securing of a loan totaling approximately 1 million Australian dollars, with an initial advance of $250,000 to be repaid within four months. This funding forms part of Volt Resources' broader, non-dilutive funding strategy aimed at supporting its operations in both the U.S. and Europe. Anticipated results from this funding pipeline are expected within three months.

Volt Resources has strategically focused on selling high-value, high-margin graphite products from its European facilities amidst the current low-price graphite market. Although challenges persist in securing financing for new projects, progress continues with additional financial initiatives underway. Moreover, the company is actively engaged in a testing program with a major customer that commenced in January 2024. This collaboration is crucial for Volt Resources' commercial success, particularly in the development and marketing of high-purity and coated specialized graphite products like the natural graphite anode.

Chintawar also revealed that Volt Resources is exploring opportunities to secure substantial grant funding, potentially exceeding $150 million. Such funding would significantly impact the company's financial trajectory and support its downstream business initiatives. Despite global restrictions impacting graphite exports, notably from China, Volt Resources remains focused on its high-value product strategy to navigate and capitalize on current market conditions.
