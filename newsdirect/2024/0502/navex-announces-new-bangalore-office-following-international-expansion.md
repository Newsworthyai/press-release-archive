# NAVEX Announces New Bangalore Office Following International Expansion

--News Direct--

NAVEX, the global leader in integrated risk and compliance management software, today announced its expansion into South Asia with the establishment of a new Global Capability Center (GCC) in Bangalore, India.

The decision to establish a permanent presence in India is a significant step forward in executing on NAVEX’s strategic goals driven by the company’s ongoing commitment to international growth, talent acquisition, and investment in technology and services. Its proximity to key Asian markets, such as Singapore, Japan, and Australia, also adds fundamental value to business operations.

Sean Thompson, CEO at NAVEX, said, “The introduction of our new GCC in India is a game-changer and marks an exciting chapter for NAVEX as we strengthen our global presence and aim for new milestones. This is just our first leap into Asia as we continue to explore opportunities for smart, strategic development in the region. We continue to witness significant expansion globally, driven by the everchanging regulatory environment and increasing customer demand to build cultures focused on creating transparent, safe, and responsible workplaces.”

With a presence now across America, Europe, and Asia, NAVEX’s impact spans across the globe; providing over 73 million employees at more than 13,000 organizations with a safer place to work. Due to significant international customer momentum in Europe, the company opened a new London office in 2023. The move follows its growing footprint in Finland, the acquisition of WhistleB in Sweden, and the establishment of its Frankfurt data facility.

As a purpose driven company, NAVEX prides itself on creating a people first culture that is meaningful and relatable to each person. In addition to offering a myriad of learning and development programs that support career growth, NAVEX offers a wide array of benefits and resources designed to support healthy living. It is a multi-award-winning employer of choice, most recently named in 2024 as a USA Top Workplace by USA Today. The company has also been recognized by customers and industry experts for its leading culture, products, and services.

To ensure NAVEX remains at the forefront of market trends, the GCC will help the business operate with agility while building awareness among companies in India seeking governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) expertise. It will play a pivotal role in accelerating product innovation and building on the company’s legacy. Notably, NAVEX recently introduced to its portfolio the Compliance Assistant AI solution in NAVEX One.

Udayakumar Sethu, India Site Leader at NAVEX, adds, “NAVEX is looking forward to recruiting outstanding talent that the Bangalore market offers. We are excited to have a presence in this vibrant city. Our commitment is to empower the global market by providing the necessary tools, guidance, and training to employees and businesses to protect themselves against risks and meet regulatory requirements – all while building stronger organizational cultures.”
