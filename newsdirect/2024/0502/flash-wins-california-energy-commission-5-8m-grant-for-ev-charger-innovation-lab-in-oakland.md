# Flash Wins California Energy Commission $5.8M Grant for EV Charger ‘Innovation Lab’ in Oakland

--News Direct--

The California Energy Commission (CEC) and Flash, a pioneer in parking + charging solutions, today announced Flash secured a $5.8 million grant from CEC for a large-scale electric vehicle (EV) charger demonstration project in Oakland, California. The first-of-its-kind project will deploy at least 446 low-cost Level 2 EV chargers over a two-year period in convenient, high-density, high-visibility installations in a 1.5-mile area around downtown Oakland.

With $24 million in funding from California’s Clean Transportation Program, the CEC grant to Flash and other awardees aims to demonstrate replicable and scalable business and technology models to deploy Level 2 charging infrastructure and improve public awareness of and confidence in Level 2 charging access. The project will also include installation of two Battery Energy Storage Systems that will help safeguard EV charger affordability during periods of peak energy demand.

“Bay Area residents’ early commitment to the EV transition uniquely positions this community to serve as an ‘Innovation Lab’ for electrification projects in California and nationwide,” said Matt McCaffree, Vice President of Utility Market Development for Flash. “This collaboration with CEC will not only show what’s possible in high-density smart cities like Oakland but also keep the charging gap for early adopters from becoming a confidence gap for the next wave.”

Bay Area EV adoption continues to outpace the national average by a factor of three. By installing reliable, affordable, and convenient public chargers, Flash and the CEC aim to close the charging gap and encourage further EV adoption—particularly among downtown residents, for whom dependable public charging is a prerequisite for ownership in lieu of at-home chargers. The success of the project would establish quality public charging as a standard among the practical, convenient, and environmentally-friendly “smart cities” of the future.

“For residents living in downtown areas where at-home charging isn't an option, reliable and convenient public charging is key for continued EV adoption,” said CEC’s Lead Commissioner for Transportation Patty Monahan. “The CEC is looking forward to Flash's deployment of hundreds of Level 2 chargers throughout downtown Oakland to be a model of successful public charging.”

The project will also generate invaluable data regarding battery capacities, operating costs, replicable price points, and emergency procedures, as well as insights toward stimulating demand and increasing return on investment. This information can then be used to expand and improve upon the Oakland deployment and inform electrification efforts throughout California and beyond.
