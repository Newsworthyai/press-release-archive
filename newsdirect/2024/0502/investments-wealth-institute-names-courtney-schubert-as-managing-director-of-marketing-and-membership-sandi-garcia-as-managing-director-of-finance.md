“We heartily welcome both Courtney and Sandi as new leaders to help enhance awareness and drive growth for the Institute,” said Sean Walters, CAE®, Chief Executive Officer of the Institute. “Each brings valuable commercial acumen to their respective roles. Both of their talents will solidify the Institute's ability to deliver on our mission, helping our members elevate their practices to consistently generate better client outcomes.”

Schubert brings with her over 15 years of experience and expertise in financial services marketing, having held senior roles at The American College of Financial Services, Envestnet, Nitrogen (formerly Riskalyze), and SmartKx. She has an undergraduate degree in web management and internet commerce from Johnson & Wales University and a master’s degree in digital marketing from The London School of Business and Finance. In her new role, Schubert will be responsible for fostering synergy between the Institute’s marketing and membership functions to enhance the value of services provided to existing members, in addition to her focus on attracting new members. She is based in Philadelphia, PA, and reports to John Whitham, Chief Operating Officer of the Institute.

“I am excited to contribute to an organization that stands as a paragon of educational excellence for investment and wealth management professionals,” Schubert said. “I look forward to collaborating with both internal colleagues and our network of volunteers to ensure the value of Institute membership is recognized and leveraged by both our members and the financial advice community at-large.”

Garcia was most recently with the Financial Planning Association (FPA), where she was Chief Financial Officer (CFO). During her time at FPA, she oversaw several key areas of the company including Technology, Human Resources and Strategic Partnerships. Garcia has a variety of for-profit and non-profit experience, including CFO roles at the Denver Museum of Nature & Science and the Community College of Denver. She began her career at Arthur Andersen LLP and was focused primarily on financial and business system integration in the Business Consulting Division. Garcia is a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) licensed in Colorado, and she holds an undergraduate degree from the University of Colorado in Boulder with a dual emphasis in both accounting and information systems. She is based in Denver, CO, and reports to Angie Lutterman, CFO of the Institute, who is slated to retire on July 1 of this year after 14 years of service to the organization.

At that time, Garcia is expected to assume the role of CFO, as part of the Institute’s succession planning efforts. “Angie possesses a wealth of historical knowledge and financial expertise, and I am so grateful for her leadership during this transitional phase, which will help me ramp up quickly to understand the financial operations of this important, highly respected organization,” Garcia said. “I am also honored to be entrusted with serving as the new CFO of the Institute and ensuring that it continues to be fiscally resilient and responsible, now as well as into its promising future.”
