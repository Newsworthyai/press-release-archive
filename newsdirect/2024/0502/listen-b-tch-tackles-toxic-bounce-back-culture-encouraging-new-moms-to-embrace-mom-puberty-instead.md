# Listen B*tch Tackles Toxic Bounce Back Culture, Encouraging New Moms to Embrace ‘Mom Puberty’ Instead

--News Direct--

Canadian wellness brand, Listen B*tch, is launching a campaign that challenges bounce back culture and urges new moms to embrace the physical, psychological, and emotional transformation that comes with motherhood - a process they’re calling ‘Mom Puberty’. The campaign launches with a series of rallying billboards across Toronto alongside a digital gallery that offers an unfiltered view on the postpartum period while encouraging women to dismiss societal pressures to 'bounce back'.

The campaign targets bounce back culture which disregards the physical and mental recovery needed postpartum and places unrealistic expectations on women to “snapback” to their former selves. “Embracing and normalizing the change you're experiencing is a powerful way to combat bounce-back culture,” says Listen B*tch Co-Founder, Daniela Angelucci-Rizzi. “Similar to adolescence, becoming a mother is a transitional period which involves physical, hormonal, psychological and emotional changes. That process is known as 'Matrescence’. Or as we like to call it - ‘Mom Puberty”. The campaign aims to redefine the cultural conversation around postpartum experiences by presenting a more realistic view of the joys and hardships that new motherhood presents.

As part of this initiative, Listen B*tch is launching an online gallery showcasing unfiltered portraits of postpartum moms. The portraits are accompanied by personal narratives that explore their transformative journey into motherhood - the challenges, triumphs, and the things they think new or expecting moms should know. In addition to the online gallery, Listen B*tch is bringing this campaign to the streets of Toronto with billboards that champion the same message. The billboards can be found at, College & Dovercourt, Queen St West & Augusta Ave, Dundas St West & Rusholme Rd, Queen St West & Noble St, Queen St West & Triller Ave, and College St & Clinton St. On May 6th from 5pm-9pm, the general public will have the opportunity to attend an exhibit of the project at Cry Baby Gallery in Toronto. The brand is also donating copies of their New Mom and Pregnancy Affirmation Card Decks to support groups at Sunnybrook and North York General Hospital, as a way to provide tangible support and encouragement to women navigating the complexities of motherhood.

To capture the raw portraits of the Canadian moms, Listen B*tch partnered with Toronto-based photographer and mom, Jorian Charlton whose work has been featured at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Mississauga, and the critically acclaimed exhibition - The New Black Vanguard.
