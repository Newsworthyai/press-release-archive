# Mike Moran Steps Down as Executive Director of Florida PACE Funding Agency Following Election Victory in Sarasota County

The Florida PACE Funding Agency (FPFA) announced today that Executive Director Mike Moran will officially step down from his position following his recent election victory as Tax Collector in Sarasota County, Florida. Mr. Moran had previously committed to transitioning from his role at FPFA upon winning the election, demonstrating his dedication to serving the residents of Sarasota County.

At a meeting held on December 10th, 2024, in Kissimmee, Florida, the FPFA Board of Directors expressed their heartfelt gratitude to Mr. Moran for his exceptional leadership and the remarkable growth of the agency under his tenure. Mr. Moran joined FPFA as Executive Director in 2019, and he leaves the Agency after funding over 29,000 hurricane-hardening and energy efficiency projects in excess of $900,000,000. This financing includes improvements such as roofs, windows/doors, air conditioners, and generators.

Reflecting on his time with the agency, Mr. Moran stated, “Serving as the Executive Director of the Florida PACE Funding Agency has been one of the greatest honors of my professional career. Together, we have made significant strides in providing sustainable financing solutions for the residents of Florida when no one else was there to help. I am extremely confident that the agency’s future is bright under the capable leadership of Wendi Leach.”

The Board unanimously appointed Wendi Leach, currently the Director of Operations, as the new Executive Director of FPFA. Ms. Leach brings extensive experience and a deep understanding of the agency’s mission to her new role. The Board expressed their confidence in her ability to continue driving FPFA’s mission forward.

“Wendi’s leadership and operational expertise have been instrumental to our success,” said Mike Steigerwald, Chair of the FPFA Board of Directors. “Her vision and dedication will ensure that FPFA continues to thrive and serve the needs of Florida’s communities.”

The Florida PACE Funding Agency congratulates Mike Moran on his election victory and welcomes Wendi Leach as its new Executive Director, ushering in a new chapter of growth and success for the agency.
