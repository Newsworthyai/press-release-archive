Even as 2024 winds down, SBC Medical Group Holdings (NASDAQ: SBC) is gearing up for growth. The company, is expanding its footprint in Asia while bolstering its product pipeline for its services around the world. SBC Medical operates in a unique pocket of the economy – providing management services and products to cosmetic treatment centers – that is benefiting from resilient consumers. Japan’s economy, for example, has been growing for the past two straight quarters, buoyed by robust consumer spending.

SBC Medical has responded to these tailwinds by pursuing growth. In recent weeks, SBC Medical has made multiple growth-focused announcements, announcing both an acquisition and the launch of a new B2B service offering to make the lives of its corporate partners easier in the new year and beyond. Interested investors who would like to learn more about SBC Medical and its growth journey can learn more about the company’s financials here.

SBC Medical’s Growth By AcquisitionAccording to the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) market has been in recovery mode of late, and 2024 deal volume has been slower than expected. However, there are green shoots of a turnaround underway, as evidenced by a 10% increase in global aggregate M&A deal value year-to-date through September compared with the year-ago period.

Amid this global backdrop, SBC Medical revealed an acquisition of Aesthetic Healthcare Holdings (AHH), a multi-unit owner of aesthetic treatment clinics in Singapore, in an all-cash transaction. According to the BCG, Singapore has been a bright spot for M&A, with a 48% year-over-year increase in deal value through the first nine months of 2024. SBC Medical was drawn to Aesthetic Healthcare for its strong beauty and health brand reputation for providing aesthetic medical treatments to patients. Additionally, Singapore's economy has been growing, with the third quarter of 2024 seeing a 5.4% year-on-year expansion.

The deal could be a harbinger of things to come, highlighting SBC Medical’s growth-by-acquisition strategy for the future. SBC Medical plans to continue to grow via acquisition and has set its sights on further expansion in the U.S. and Asian markets, saying that Singapore is an “ideal hub” and the key to unlocking further growth in the Asian medical aesthetic market.

Through the acquisition, SBC Medical is inheriting four beauty and health brands across nearly two dozen brick-and-mortar outlets, all of which will be incorporated into the SBC clinic network. SBC Medical said it also plans to harness AHH’s strong brand recognition to strike strategic partnerships in Singapore and the rest of Asia.

Disposable incomes have been on the rise in Asia Pacific, coinciding with the region’s economic growth. Asia Pacific represents a potentially lucrative opportunity in the global aesthetic medical market, as evidenced by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11%. Singapore is especially attractive given its perception as a gateway to the wider Asian market, complemented by its mature medical infrastructure and welcoming regulatory environment.

Of the acquisition, SBC Medical Founder and CEO Yoshiyuki Aikawa said, “[We] expect to accelerate our expansion into the Asian market and strengthen our global aesthetic medical treatment delivery system. We are confident that we can create significant synergies by combining expertise in aesthetic medical treatments and management know-how we have cultivated in Japan with AHH's brand power and customer base.”

SBC Medical Launches B2B Offering With Focus On Employee WellnessIn addition to its growth-by-acquisition strategy, SBC Medical is also pursuing organic growth, highlighted by its launch of a new solution called SBC Wellness. This offering is designed to help companies provide additional health benefits while focusing on corporate employee well-being through a greater work/life balance.

SBC Wellness targets human resources managers who are likely to be drawn to the benefits of employee wellness, not least including improved employee recruitment and retention. A focus on wellness is likely to lead to healthier, happier and more productive employees. SBC Medical has already performed a successful pre-launch of SBC Wellness through which it contracted with corporate clients.

Competition in the labor market continues to ramp up, making it difficult for some businesses to hire and keep key talent. SBC Medical observed that employee satisfaction is critical to fostering employee loyalty and maintaining a competitive advantage. SBC Medical is capitalizing on a trend in which Japan’s corporate wellness sector is predicted to expand at a CAGR of nearly 9% to reach $7.4 billion in 2028, nearly doubling from 2021 levels.
