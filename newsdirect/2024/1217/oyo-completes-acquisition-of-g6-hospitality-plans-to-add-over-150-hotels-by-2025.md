Oravel Stays, the parent company of the global travel technology company OYO, today announced that it has completed its previously announced acquisition of G6 Hospitality, the leading economy lodging franchisor and parent company of the iconic Motel 6 and Studio 6 brands, from Blackstone Real Estate for $525 million.

Additionally, OYO plans to accelerate the growth of G6 Hospitality's operations, focusing on technology integration, property upgrades, and market expansion.

OYO has outlined its vision for the future of Motel 6 and Studio 6, focusing on growth while preserving the iconic brands' core values, distinct identity and leveraging the advantages of a shared corporate structure. OYO will maintain and strengthen the Motel 6 and Studio 6 brands as they command a strong brand recognition and loyal customer base built over decades. All existing franchise agreements, including exclusivity rights, will be honored, and the current franchise success teams will continue their operations without disruption.

OYO plans technological advancements to enhance the guest experience and operational efficiency. The company will take the support of its 300-member strong team of product specialists including software engineers, product managers, and designers to develop and implement better digital solutions. These improvements include enhanced mobile and web booking experience and options of dynamic pricing capabilities that can optimize rates across room types throughout the year.

In the distribution and revenue growth area, OYO plans to develop a broader network of distribution partners beyond traditional online travel agencies, while simultaneously strengthening direct booking channels and corporate booking demand.

The company has started the restructuring process to drive synergies, growth and transformation. Sonal Sinha has been appointed as the CEO.

The company extends its gratitude for their dedication and leadership throughout their tenure.

OYO is implementing strategic changes to enhance operational efficiency. The company plans to hire team members primarily in the franchisee facing functions while consolidating and rightsizing some functions to create better synergies across the organization. The company's franchise development & support and safety & security organization remains fully intact. As part of the integration process, OYO and G6 will combine some parts of the corporate operations with OYO’s existing global excellence teams.

Gautam Swaroop, CEO, OYO International, said, “We will continue to invest in skills that are unique and critical to the G6 business such as Supply, Account Management, Corporate Sales, Brand Standards, Offline marketing, Safety & Security.
