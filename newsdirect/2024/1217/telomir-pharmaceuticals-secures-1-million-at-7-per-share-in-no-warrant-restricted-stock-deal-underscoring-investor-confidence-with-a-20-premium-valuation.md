Telomir Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: TELO), the pre-clinical-stage company aiming to position itself as an emerging leader in age-reversal science, recently announced it has raised $1 million in equity financing through The Starwood Trust. The investment was made through a common stock purchase, in which the purchase price of $7 per share represents a 20% premium to the market price on the date of execution and included no warrants.

In September 2024, The Starwood Trust extended a $5 million non-dilutive line of credit to the firm, which remains undrawn. The additional funding reflects the confidence that The Starwood Trust has in Telomir’s product portfolio, putting the pharmaceutical company in a stronger financial position to advance its scientific research and product development activities, the company said.

Regarding this recent financing activity, Erez Aminov, chairperson and CEO of Telomir, commented, “Securing funding at a premium to market without warrants demonstrates the strength of our financial strategy and our commitment to delivering value to shareholders. These recent preclinical results reaffirm our belief in Telomir-1’s ability to redefine how we treat chronic diseases and aging by addressing their root causes.”

Telomir Pharmaceuticals’ Telomir-1 And Other TherapiesTelomir-1, Telomir Pharmaceuticals' leading product offering, is a molecule being developed to lengthen telomeres – the protective caps on the ends of DNA strands that naturally shorten with age. This shortening is also associated with various degenerative diseases.

Recently, Telomir Pharmaceuticals reported that preclinical research for Telomir-1 confirmed its age-reversal and longevity benefits and its ability to address type 2 diabetes at its root cause. Furthermore, studies showed significant reductions in fasting plasma glucose levels, improved glucose homeostasis and the reversal of insulin resistance to near pre-diabetic levels.

Telomir-1’s true distinction from other therapies stems from its ability to address the foundational cause of aging and disease, including oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, telomere shortening and regulation of metal overactivity, such as iron and copper dysregulation.

Telomir-1 has the potential to provide treatment for critical conditions, such as Progeria, which is a rare genetic disorder that accelerates aging in children, and Wilson Disease, a rare genetic disorder characterized by the body's inability to eliminate excess copper leading to its accumulation in various organs, particularly the liver, brain and eyes. Also, common age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer, are also in scope.

A Growing Market OpportunityAccording to research conducted by Research Nester, the global market for age-reversal and age-related therapies is estimated to be $59.75 billion in 2024 and is anticipated to reach $215.95 billion by 2037. Telomir Pharmaceuticals is striving to position itself to capitalize on this growing market as it advances Telomir-1 toward clinical development by focusing on therapies that potentially address the underlying causes of the previously mentioned conditions.

Looking ForwardTelomir-1 may represent a groundbreaking approach in age-reversal science, potentially transforming treatments for age-related diseases. Telomir Pharmaceuticals says that the additional funding it has received propels it toward bringing its treatments to market and helping people around the world live longer, more fulfilled lives.
