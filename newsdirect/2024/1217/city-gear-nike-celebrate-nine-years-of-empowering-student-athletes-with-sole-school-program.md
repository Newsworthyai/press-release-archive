“For nine years, the Sole School program has embodied City Gear’s commitment to giving back and uplifting the communities we serve,” said Ben Knighten, President, City Gear. “This initiative isn’t just about financial support – it’s about fostering a connection with local schools and creating a brighter future for student athletes by connecting them with opportunities. In fact, our leaders tell us they get as much out of this program as the students they support.”

Empowering High School Athletes

Each of the 21 High Schools designated as Sole Schools this year received contributions and outreach from City Gear and Nike through funding, in-kind donations and product to support their basketball programs, collectively valued at more than $150,000.

Sole School athletes also receive City Gear swag, product and mentoring from local City Gear leadership, in addition to job opportunities.

“Our relationship with City Gear and being selected as a Sole School has been great,” said Coach Clifton Terrell, Athletic Coordinator, North Forest High School, Houston, Texas. “City Gear has provided our teams with an opportunity to provide our student-athletes with much needed support in playing the game of basketball. Our school really needs the support that City Gear has provided for the last several years.”

"Our Partnership with City Gear and being chosen as a Sole School has been absolutely amazing,” said Wade Mason, Athletic Director and Head Basketball Coach, St Augustine High School, New Orleans, Louisiana. “City Gear has furnished us with much required help, and we are incredibly grateful for all they have accomplished for us here at St Aug High School. Irvin and his team at City Gear have really become part of our St Augustine family,"

"Being chosen as a Sole School means the world to the St Mary High School Young ladies Basketball program and it will have a significant impact on our main goal and the existences of the players," said Principal Pamela, St Mary High School, New Orleans, Louisiana. "City Gear’s obligation to the Young ladies Basketball program is really admirable, and we are unquestionably thankful for the positive distinction they are making in our community."
