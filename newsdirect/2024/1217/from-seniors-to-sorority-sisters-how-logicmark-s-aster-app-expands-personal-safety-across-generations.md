With Aster by LogicMark Inc. (NASDAQ: LGMK), you can transform your smartphone into a personal safety device using their 24/7 monitoring app. It’s one possible solution for ensuring your safety—whether you’re in a parking lot, on a date, in a rideshare, on a morning jog, walking down a quiet street or anywhere else.

The Aster app and emergency button from LogicMark, the maker of personal emergency response systems (PERS), health communications devices and IoT technologies, turns mobile phones into personal safety devices. With a tap or slide of the screen, help can be on the way in minutes. Accidents and assaults can happen to anyone, anywhere. Apps like Aster aim to provide a level of protection that wasn’t available before. The Aster emergency button pairs with the app to support users reaching help without ever opening their phone.

“For years, personal safety and security technology has remained static and bogged down by antiquated technology. No one has built a universal solution that’s focused on making personal safety and family security a priority for all ages,” says Chia-Lin Simmons, the CEO of the company. “LogicMark recognized the need to radically transform this industry, and with Aster, aims to provide everyone involved with the peace of mind and independence they deserve.”

America Craves ProtectionPeace of mind is in short order if polling is any evidence. Americans, particularly young women, don’t feel safe. According to Gallup, 40% of Americans, the most in three decades, say they are afraid to walk alone at night. Gallup shows that more than 30% of people avoid visiting cities as well as participating in wellness activities outdoors. At the same time, seniors are more mobile and independent, putting them at an increased risk of a fall or medical event. Apps like Aster are growing in demand across demographics so that people can live their lives without reducing their activities. The global personal security apps market is forecast to reach $2.45 billion by the end of 2032, growing at a CAGR of 14% over 2024-2032.

With the Aster app, which works on both iPhone and Android devices, mobile phones are turned into personal protection devices that can contact emergency services, friends and loved ones. The software serves as a virtual safety net, connecting users with their trusted circle—whether it’s friends, sorority sisters, parents, or neighbors. In return, users can gain peace of mind in any situation while staying connected to their own personal village, says LogicMark.

All-round ProtectionWith Aster, users have four ways to get help: an Aster emergency button, a home screen slider for quick access to emergency services, a Hold Until Safe button to arm the app and the Follow-Me feature to schedule alerts and check-ins. Once activated, the app requires you to enter a PIN to cancel if there is no immediate threat. Emergency services are alerted and dispatched to the phone’s GPS location. Followers (friends, family members, etc.) will receive an SMS message alerting them that the user needs assistance and a link is sent to the user’s location. Users can add trusted followers for check-ins and schedule events like a date. If you don’t check in as planned, the Aster monitoring service will reach out to you. If the alarm isn’t canceled, your selected contacts, as well as emergency services, will be notified.

LogicMark’s emergency button, no bigger than an AirTag and free when you sign up for all Aster subscriptions, is a small bluetooth device that clips to a purse, keychain or backpack strap that users can push to call for help without unlocking their phone screen or taking their phone out of their pockets or bags. The button calls for help with three presses, and a 24/7 monitoring service will answer and stay on the phone until users feel safe. Used with the Aster app, it acts as a quick-access emergency device – helping provide peace of mind to those who want to feel safer.

The company says that Aster stands out because of its ability to offer protection across all generations. It makes it easy to stay connected to loved ones wherever they go and to contact emergency services when needed with just a button push. It could work for a college student walking at night on campus, a real estate agent hosting an open house by themselves, an avid runner on an early morning run or an active senior going on a hike. Most people want protection, and Aster aims to provide it. Check out LogicMark’s investment deck here.
