# African American Heritage Brands Black Radiance and Cross Colours Join Forces For Retro Beauty Collaboration

Black Radiance, the leading beauty brand for women of color, has teamed up with Cross Colours, the Afro-centric streetwear brand that embodies the bold spirit of retro hip-hop culture, for an exciting first-ever collaboration. This partnership brings together two trailblazing brands with deep roots in African American culture, uniting to honor their shared heritage by reimagining the bold, expressive spirit of the 80s and 90s hip-hop culture through innovative makeup design.

With over 30 years of shaping beauty and fashion for the African American community, the collection draws inspiration from Cross Colours' vibrant color aesthetic, capturing the essence of the hip-hop era. Together, the brands are celebrating a time when music, fashion, and beauty pushed boundaries and defined an era.

"This partnership is a full-circle moment for Black Radiance," said K. MacDonald Parris, Vice President of Marketing at Black Radiance. “We are thrilled to work with the iconic label that helped shape hip-hop culture and revolutionized streetwear just as we’ve redefined beauty for Black women. Now, we’ve come together to honor that era and bring it into today’s digital and social world, creating bold new beauty moments that resonate with both the original generation and today’s youth."

“We’ve always seen makeup artists creating incredible looks inspired by Cross Colours,” said TJ Walker, Co-Founder of Cross Colours. “That creativity inspired us to give something back to the beauty community, something that reflects the spirit of individuality and self-expression that Cross Colours was built on. Black Radiance shares this passion for celebrating authenticity, making this collaboration feel so natural."

“The retro theme of this collection pays homage to the era that birthed our brands and celebrates the deep connection between music, fashion, and beauty,” said Carl Jones, Co-Founder of Cross Colours. “This collection is a celebration of Black beauty in all its forms—it’s about empowerment, individuality, and embracing who you are. Through this collaboration, we continue our commitment to uplifting Black women and redefining beauty standards.”
