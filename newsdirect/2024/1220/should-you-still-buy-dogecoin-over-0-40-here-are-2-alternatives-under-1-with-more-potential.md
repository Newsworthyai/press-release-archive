At this point, it would be surprising for Dogecoin (DOGE) not to reach $1 and beyond. The meme coin king continues to dominate the space as it cemented itself as a legitimate asset in the broader market. With that being said, there are other altcoins that could surpass Dogecoin in terms of ROI. While Tron (TRX) is an obvious example, a new arrival, Cutoshi (CUTO), could soon take the spotlight.

Dogecoin Is Struggling To Breakout After Month-Long ConsolidationWhen Donald Trump won the US presidency in early November, Dogecoin stunned the market with a triple-digit rally that saw its price multiply in the span of a few days. However, shortly after, Dogecoin began stalling as its momentum waned and selling pressure increased. After peaking at $0.47 Dogecoin (DOGE) entered a narrow trading channel with its price fluctuating around the $0.40 mark.

On the other hand, whales continue to bolster their Dogecoin position in anticipation of a new rally. Analyst Ali Martinez has shared impressive on-chain numbers on X, highlighting a recent buying spree that saw large wallets spending over $64 million to purchase 160 million DOGE.

In regards to Dogecoin’s price action, renowned DOGE bull KrissPax has highlighted a bull flag pattern on the chart. According to Kriss, a breakout above the trendline could propel Dogecoin to $0.69 by the end of the year. If this projection plays out, the prophesied $1 DOGE could become a reality in Q1 2025.

Tron Is Retesting Lower Levels After ATH RunTron (TRX) has been in up-only mode since bottoming out in 2022. In late 2024, Tron entered escape velocity as it tore through major resistance levels with ease and reached a new all-time high for the first time since 2018. However, after tagging the $0.42 peak, Tron’s price started to decline as bears stepped in. At press time, Tron trades at $0.28 following a 6.1% intraday decrease which was accompanied by an 18.8% decline in 24-hour volume, with roughly $1.88 billion worth of TRX traded across exchange platforms.

However, analyst Anni Sarahayu points out on X that a Tron is printing a string of higher lows on the 4-hour chart. This teases an incoming breakout which could send Tron soaring to new heights by the end of December.

At $24.7 billion, Tron’s market cap is worth less than half of Dogecoin's $60 billion, meaning that investors looking for projects with a proven track record and much greater room for growth could consider adding TRX to their portfolio. However, there could be an even better option.

Cutoshi’s Farming Mechanism Is Turning HeadsCutoshi is already making waves with its hybrid framework that merges meme lore with DeFi functionality, creating the first-ever MemeFi ecosystem.

The project is centered around CUTO DEX, a cross-chain, fully private, decentralized exchange that could soon give established protocols like Uniswap or Rayidium, a run for their money. Investors will be able to perform lightning-fast transactions on all major blockchains at some of the lowest fees on the market.

Japanese Lucky Cats are said to bring prosperity to businesses. Cutoshi brings good fortune to the blockchain. Cutoshi Farming is one of the platform’s most intriguing features. Users will have the opportunity to earn massive prizes while growing their $CUTO portfolio. They will be tasked with completing fun missions aimed at expanding Cutoshi’s online reach.

In exchange for their efforts, they will receive CUTO points which can be redeemed for more $CUTO once the token hits the markets. Moreover, a staking option will soon be available as well, allowing holders to put their $CUTO to work and tap into a passive income stream.

Stage 4 of the presale is now live and over $1.37 million has been raised so far. $CUTO sells for just $0.031, making this the perfect entry point for early adopters who want to capitalize on this new DeFi-driven meme coin.
