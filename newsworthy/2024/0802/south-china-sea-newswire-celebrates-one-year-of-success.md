# South China Sea NewsWire Celebrates One Year of Success

Columbia, South Carolina (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Aug 2, 2024 @ 10:25 AM Pacific — On August 2, 2024, the South China Sea NewsWire celebrates the first anniversary of its launch. Initially designed to aggregate news sources, books, conferences, podcasts, and other sources of information on all facets of the South China Sea, the South China Sea NewsWire has since grown to offer catalogues of reposted articles, social media coverage, and original content by both subject matter experts and the general public.

“When the NewsWire was launched, we intended to provide a mix of balanced and insightful news that favors discovery over opinion,” says James Borton, Editor in Chief of the South China Sea NewsWire. “Not only have we done just that, but we continue to expand our offerings to help policymakers, businesses, academics, and others interested learn further about all aspects of this critically important region.”

At its launch, the South China Sea NewsWire partnered with Perigon to gather regular news articles on all aspects of the South China Sea. Perigon’s News API has been a key component of the NewsWire’s growth and remains a valuable asset in the NewsWire’s news collection service. Perigon uses AI-enriched technology to provide structured, intelligently classified news data in real-time from over 80,000 global sources and counting.

The South China Sea NewsWire has not only grown in its aggregation but also in its institutional infrastructure and content. Over the NewsWire’s first year, the support team has more than doubled, an advisory board of talented experts has been convened, social media engagement has ramped up, and original written content has been published on the NewsWire’s own pages. This growth can best be seen in the overall engagement of the community – since August 1, 2023, over 1,900 unique individual users have visited the NewsWire’s website.

“We are thankful for the contributions of our talented and dedicated team, our advisory board, Perigon, and all those who read and continue to support the NewsWire,” says Borton. “Our success would not be possible without their dedication and support and we are truly grateful.” The NewsWire team celebrates the successful conclusion of one year and eagerly looks forward to all that can be accomplished through the next.
