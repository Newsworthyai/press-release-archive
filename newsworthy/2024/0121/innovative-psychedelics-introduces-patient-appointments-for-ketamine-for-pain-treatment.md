# Innovative Psychedelics Introduces Patient Appointments for Ketamine for Pain Treatment

Downers Grove, IL (Newsworthy.ai) Sunday Jan 21, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Eastern — Innovative Psychedelics, a leading clinic in mental health treatments, is excited to offer new patient appointments for IV ketamine therapy, targeting severe depression, mood disorders, and chronic pain. Our expert medical team, equipped with the latest technology, delivers personalized care for those seeking relief from chronic pain.

Known for our expertise in depression and ketamine pain therapy, we've also successfully introduced Spravato treatments. We specialize in helping individuals with chronic pain who are unresponsive to traditional treatments or those preparing for surgery. Conditions treated include cancer, CRPS, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain, phantom pain, postherpetic neuralgia, sickle cell disease, and spinal injuries.

Our pain treatment involves a three-hour infusion, typically once a month. It's important to note that ketamine infusion for mood or pain disorders is off-label and not FDA-approved for this use. Side effects can include high blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, and perceptual disturbances.

Innovative Psychedelics specializes in innovative mental health treatments, with a team of experienced professionals providing personalized care for depression, mood disorders, and chronic pain.

In addition to its Chicago clinic, Innovative Psychedelics has a location in Downers Grove, IL. Visit their website for contact details and hours of operation for both locations.
