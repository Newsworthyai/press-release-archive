# HR Research Institute Unveils Catch-22 of Coaching and Mentoring in Organizations

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Aug 1, 2024 @ 8:30 AM America/Toronto — HR.com’s HR Research Institute (HRRI) has released a new report highlighting a critical challenge in today's organizations: the conundrum of developing effective coaches. The research reveals that to develop good coaches, you need good coaches to coach them—a catch-22 that many organizations are struggling to navigate.

The report finds that fewer than half of respondents consider their internal coaches and mentors to be well-trained. Even more concerning, about a quarter of organizations (26%) lack any formal coaching or mentoring programs, missing out on significant benefits such as helping employees realize their potential and preparing them for new roles.

Coaching and mentoring are priorities for most organizations today, and a majority plan to place greater importance on them in the near future. However, there are many challenges that organizations are facing that are hindering these programs, including:

* not devoting enough time to coaching/mentoring: 61%
* lack of defined and measurable outcomes: 40%
* lack of concrete options for training, development, and career pathing: 39%

“Coaching and mentoring are vital for nurturing the next generation of leaders,” stated Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator and CEO of HR.com. “Addressing the gaps revealed in this study is essential for organizations aiming to enhance their coaching programs and develop future leaders effectively.”

The full research report, HR.com’s Future of Coaching and Mentoring 2024, is available for free download and offers detailed insights and actionable recommendations for HR professionals looking to build more effective employee development initiatives.

The recording of the research webcast presentation, The Coaching & Mentoring Forecast: Trends You Can't Afford to Ignore!, is available for viewing 24/7 on demand.
