# The Remedy Introduces Deep TMS Therapy for Effective Treatment of Depression and OCD

Vadnais Heights, Minnesota (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Jan 18, 2024 @ 5:00 PM Eastern â€” The Remedy, one of the leading mental health clinic centers with exceptional treatment opportunities, is glad to announce the implementation of Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (dTMS) therapy within its services. The advanced technology proves to be an effective, safe, and well-tolerated option for patients with the experience of treatment-resistant depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

Brainsway's Deep TMS device is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for depression and OCD in medication- and psychotherapy-refractory patients from the general population. Patients also noted positive changes in symptoms of anxiety and PTSD, sleep patterns, pain levels, and overall energy levels during their TMS treatment along with significant decreases in depression and OCD symptom severity.

Unlike other invasive treatments, dTMS therapy is not painful or disturbs the patient's daily routine and does not require hospitalization or anesthesia. Patients getting dTMS treatment can get into their daily activities immediately after every session. Most importantly, this service is covered by insurance, making it possible to better mental health and quality of life within weeks.

The Remedy's commitment to ensuring the best mental healthcare quality culminates in the introduction of dTMS therapy. Every person deserves an effective treatment option according to The Remedy, and they are dedicated to expanding the scope of their services
