# Pacific Mind Health: Offering Hope and Relief Through Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Therapy

Long Beach, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Jan 18, 2024 @ 5:00 PM Eastern â€” Pacific Mind Health, a leading mental health service provider, is pleased to offer a comprehensive range of treatment options to individuals suffering from mental health conditions. With a team of dedicated professionals and multiple office locations, Pacific Mind Health aims to provide hope and relief to its patients.

Among the various treatment options offered by Pacific Mind Health, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Therapy stands out as a highly effective and non-invasive solution for individuals with depression. By using magnetic fields, TMS stimulates nerve cells in the brain, alleviating symptoms of depression. This FDA-cleared treatment is also recommended by the American Psychiatric Association for major depressive disorder, highlighting its efficacy and credibility.

As part of their commitment to improving patient experience, Pacific Mind Health also offers an innovative therapy called Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS). This groundbreaking treatment provides the benefits of traditional TMS therapy but requires just 3 minutes per session, minimizing discomfort and time spent by patients.

Pacific Mind Health's range of services extends beyond TMS Therapy. They provide comprehensive treatment options, including Ketamine/Spravato Therapy, ADHD services, telepsychiatry services, psychotherapy, and pharmacogenomic testing. With a team of experienced psychiatrists, medication management professionals, and psychotherapy providers, Pacific Mind Health ensures personalized and holistic care for every patient.

Individuals seeking mental health services can benefit from Pacific Mind Health's expertise. Along with its diverse treatments, Pacific Mind Health accepts most major insurance plans and offers medication refills for added convenience.
