# Boerne Kendall County EDC Honored with 2024 CEDA for Pioneering Launch of Das GreenHaus

Boerne, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Aug 16, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Central — The Boerne Kendall County Economic Development Corporation (BKCEDC) proudly announces that it has received the prestigious 2024 Community Economic Development Award (CEDA) from the Southern Economic Development Council (SEDC) for its instrumental role in the launch of Das GreenHaus, Boerne’s first business incubator.

Recognition of Excellence

Amy Story, President and CEO of BKCEDC, accepted the award on behalf of the organization, marking a significant achievement as this is the first time BKCEDC has been honored by SEDC. "This award is a testament to the collaborative efforts of the BKCEDC, the Boerne Kendall County Angel Network (BKCAN), and our dedicated community leaders and private partners," said Story. "We are thrilled to receive public acknowledgment for our role in this long-term investment in Kendall County’s future, which is already proving successful."

Empowering Entrepreneurs through Das GreenHaus

Das GreenHaus, a 501(c)(3) public-private nonprofit, was launched in June 2023 with a mission to provide critical support, resources, education, and mentorship to aspiring entrepreneurs in the Texas Hill Country. In just over a year, Das GreenHaus has made a substantial impact, with more than 50 founders actively participating in its Idea-to-Market curriculum.

Das GreenHaus is proud to highlight several success stories from its first year. Notably, LOCOAL, a Waste-to-Energy climate technology company and program participant, recently announced plans to establish its headquarters and innovation facility in the Texas Hill Country—a significant milestone shared during an interview on The Building Texas Show. Additionally, several small business founders have experienced growth in revenue and market share, with some moving toward establishing permanent locations.

Commitment to Community Engagement

Beyond fostering entrepreneurial success, Das GreenHaus is deeply committed to giving back to the local community. The organization actively participates in school district programs such as Boerne ISD’s Incubator.edu program, creates student internship opportunities, and hosts educational and networking events. These initiatives aim to bring community members together in support of a thriving local entrepreneurial ecosystem.

Das GreenHaus and the BKCEDC are proud to be recognized with the CEDA award and look forward to continuing their work in growing and supporting the community of innovators and inventors in the Texas Hill Country.
