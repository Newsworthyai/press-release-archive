# Solar Electric Supply, Inc. and P&R Technologies Expand Support for Ten West Link Transmission Line Project

Scotts Valley, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Nov 13, 2024 @ 1:00 PM Pacific — Solar Electric Supply, Inc. (SES), a leading solar energy solutions provider, and its partner P&R Technologies are pleased to announce the ongoing success and expansion of their work on the Ten West Link 500kV Transmission Line Project. Since initially delivering 110 MAPPS solar obstruction utility LED lighting systems in early 2023, the project has placed an additional order for 15 more systems, bringing the total to 125. SES is also providing ongoing field support and technician training in 2024, underscoring its commitment to maintaining this vital renewable infrastructure.

The Ten West Link 500kV Transmission Line Project sponsored by DCR Transmission, plays a vital role in enhancing power reliability and facilitating renewable energy integration in the region. The project connects multiple large solar farms along the corridor to the 500kW line, with the Arizona terminus connecting to the Delaney Substation 500 kV bus (owned by APS) and the California terminus linking to the Colorado River 500 kV bus (owned by SCE).

“Working with Solar Electric Supply has been instrumental in keeping this project on track,” said Parker Osgood, a representative from P&R Technologies. “Their team’s expertise in delivering and supporting these systems has ensured a smooth installation process for the crew, and their ongoing support has been invaluable.”SES supplied 110 of their MAPPS Model MAPPS-400-324-24-120 a custom 400-watt solar system featuring a 324 amp-hour sealed gel battery and a 120 VAC sine wave inverter. These systems, made in the USA, satisfy Buy America and ARRA requirements and feature remote wireless monitoring for this critical application. SES also provided on-site training for the installation contractors during the initial phase, ensuring a smooth and efficient deployment process.

The project's success is a testament to the collaboration between SES, P&R Technologies, Irby (a subsidiary of Sonepar specializing in electrical distribution to the utility industry) and DCR Transmission. The new transmission line is expected to keep ratepayer costs low, as utilities will save millions of dollars annually due to their increased access to power markets. Furthermore, renewable energy developers have already submitted nearly 5,000 MW of interconnection requests for the project, which will provide economic opportunities and thousands of jobs to rural Arizona communities hosting new solar generation resources.

Vice President Kamala Harris Highlights Ten West Link ProjectOn January 23, 2023, Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at the groundbreaking event for the Ten West Link transmission line in Tonopah, Arizona. In her remarks, Vice President Harris emphasized the importance of investing in clean energy infrastructure and the role of projects like Ten West Link in creating jobs and combating the climate crisis. "The Ten West Link transmission line will stretch from Arizona to California," said Vice President Harris. "It will deliver electricity from wind and solar farms out here in the desert, to big cities like Phoenix and Los Angeles and San Diego, and to rural communities like Blythe and Quartzsite. This electricity will be clean electricity." The Vice President also noted the economic benefits of the project, stating, "More transition to transmission lines means more clean energy for our communities. And that means more money in the pocket of the American people, more money to buy groceries, to invest in home repairs, to pay for your kid's college, and to save for your retirement."
