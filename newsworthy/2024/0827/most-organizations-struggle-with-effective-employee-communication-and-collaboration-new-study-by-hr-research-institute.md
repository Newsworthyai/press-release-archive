# Most Organizations Struggle with Effective Employee Communication and Collaboration - New Study by HR Research Institute

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Aug 27, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Central — A recent report by HR.com’s HR Research Institute (HRRI) reveals that only 15% of organizations consider themselves to be at the two highest levels of HRRI’s communication maturity model. Additionally, just 31% of respondents rate the effectiveness of their communication as high or very high, indicating widespread dissatisfaction with current communication practices.

The new study of HR professionals was launched to help employers and HR departments understand the state of employee communication and collaboration across organizations. Findings uncover a significant gap in communication effectiveness. Most organizations rate themselves as mediocre or worse in their workforce communication efforts, highlighting a critical area in need of improvement.

Further exploring what sets leading organizations apart, the study identified key factors that contribute to successful employee communication:

* Effective Measurement: Organizations that are highly successful at employee communication are over 19 times more likely to effectively measure their communication efforts to a high or very high degree.
* Maturity in Communication: These leading organizations are also 10 times more likely to be at the highest stage of communication maturity, setting them apart in their ability to foster clear, consistent, and impactful communication across the workforce.

In addition, these problems may be largely due to gaps in managerial communication, pointing to a strong suggestion to bolster workforce communication skills.

* Only about half (47%) agree or strongly agree that managers in their organizations are actively listening.
* Just 35% believe that their managers are well-trained in communication skills.
* A small minority (28%) say managers have access to good communication metrics.

“The data clearly shows that communication is a significant challenge for many organizations,” stated Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator and CEO of HR.com. “There’s a critical need for organizations to reassess and strengthen their communication strategies to foster better collaboration and overall workplace effectiveness.”
