# Development Is a Privilege, Not a Right: Lisa Moretti Pushes for Stronger Rules in Pasco County, Florida

Pasco County, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Sep 25, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Eastern — Lisa Moretti, candidate for Pasco County Commissioner, is making her stance clear: development is not an automatic right but a privilege that must be earned through responsible and community-focused planning. As Pasco County faces unprecedented growth, Moretti is calling for stronger rules and regulations that prioritize the needs of residents over the desires of out-of-town developers.

“For far too long, developers have been given free rein in Pasco County, with little consideration for the long-term impact on our communities, infrastructure, and natural resources,” said Moretti. “Development should be a privilege, granted only when it aligns with the vision of our residents and the capacity of our local infrastructure to support it.”

The Consequences of Unchecked Growth

Pasco County has seen a surge in large-scale development projects, driven primarily by out-of-town and multinational developers looking to capitalize on the area’s growing population. However, the rapid pace of construction has led to significant issues, including overcrowded schools, flooding, increased traffic, and higher ad valorem taxes. Many residents feel that their voices are being drowned out by corporate interests.

“Pasco County is at a tipping point,” said Moretti. “We’re seeing overcrowded classrooms, roads that can’t handle the traffic, and emergency services stretched to their limits. This is the direct result of development that prioritizes profits over people. It’s time for that to change.”

Stronger Rules for Smarter Growth

Lisa Moretti’s vision for Pasco County includes sticking to a comprehensive set of rules to ensure that new developments are in line with the community’s needs and values. Her plan involves:

- Holding Developers Accountable: No more massive zoning changes to accommodate out-of-town interests. Development should fit within the existing Comprehensive Plan and future land use, which reflects the vision of Pasco County’s residents.

- Protecting Natural Resources: Pasco County’s water supply and green spaces are at risk. Moretti’s plan ensures that any new development must include measures to protect these vital resources, stop overpumping Pasco water resources to meet the needs of other counties and limit frivolous amenities in developments that overburden our drinking water aquifer.

- Balancing Growth with Infrastructure: Moretti will push for a development model where infrastructure, including schools, roads, and emergency services, must be upgraded or expanded before new construction is approved and that protections for residents are primary in the planning process. Pasco’s long-time communities are often overlooked for funding to accommodate new construction ventures.

- Resident-Centric Planning: Moretti is committed to ensuring that residents, not developers, are at the center of the county’s growth strategy. She plans to reinstate accessible public meetings, recognize residents as stakeholders, return the citizen’s roundtable with the planning department, and ensure that local voices are heard and integrated into every planning decision.

A Call for Sustainable Growth

Moretti firmly believes that Pasco County must slow the pace of development to ensure it is sustainable. “We cannot continue down this path of runaway growth,” Moretti explained. “We need a measured, thoughtful approach that balances economic opportunity with the quality of life that continues to ensure that Pasco County is a special place to live.”

Her vision is to create communities where infrastructure meets the needs of the population, where natural resources are preserved, and where residents have a say in their future. By treating development as a privilege and not a right, Moretti aims to protect Pasco County’s identity and its long-term well-being.
