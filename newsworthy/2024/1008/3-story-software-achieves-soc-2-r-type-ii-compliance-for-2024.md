# 3 Story Software Achieves SOC 2® Type II Compliance for 2024

New Milford, CT (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Oct 8, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Eastern — At 3 Story Software, we are dedicated to streamlining the way companies globally hire and manage their contingent workforce, ensuring efficiency, security, and compliance at every step. Today, we are excited to announce that we have successfully completed our System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2® Type II Audit for the period June 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024, conducted by A-LIGN.

"Our clients and partners can trust that we are meeting the highest standards for security and compliance," says Joseph Marsh, Managing Director of 3SS. "Undergoing a SOC2 Type II audit annually reflects our ongoing dedication to ensuring that our systems and processes remain secure, available, and confidential."

This year, the audit confirmed the effectiveness of our robust privacy practices, particularly the encryption of data both at rest and in transit, using advanced technologies like AES 256 encryption for all critical backups, ensuring that sensitive customer information is fully protected.

Jay Gojuk, Director of Infrastructure and Security, added: “While we’ve always aligned our practices with top security frameworks like CISA and PCI, we are thrilled to now offer both ISO 27001 certifications and a SOC 2 Type II report. This affirms that our controls are not only designed effectively but also operate with excellence throughout each year.”

The SOC 2 audit, conducted by A-LIGN, affirmed that 3 Story Software’s controls meet the stringent standards for security, availability, confidentiality, and privacy. As companies increasingly depend on external vendors to manage critical business processes, 3SS remains dedicated to maintaining trust and transparency.
