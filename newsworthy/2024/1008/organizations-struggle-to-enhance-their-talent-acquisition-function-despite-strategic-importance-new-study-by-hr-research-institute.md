# Organizations Struggle to Enhance Their Talent Acquisition Function Despite Strategic Importance - New Study by HR Research Institute

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Oct 8, 2024 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — HR.com’s Future of Talent Acquisition 2024-25 study reveals that, despite talent acquisition (TA) being a top strategic priority for many organizations, most struggle to enhance the sophistication of their TA strategies. The study, conducted by the HR Research Institute (HRRI), highlights that only 21% of organizations rate their TA function as "advanced" (14%) or "world-class" (7%).

It’s good news that talent acquisition is a top-five priority for over 70% of organizations, yet most struggle to develop an advanced TA strategy. Further analysis indicates that skills shortages and competition for talent remain major challenges for recruiters:

* 58% cite a lack of candidates with required skills or experience.
* 54% are stuck in a reactive, just-in-time hiring approach.
* 44% report that their compensation and total rewards are below market rates, making it difficult to attract top talent.

Organizations with highly developed hiring functions, labeled as "TA leaders," stand out in key areas compared to their counterparts:

* 5X more likely to have five or more paid TA tools and technologies
* 4X more likely to say that TA is an essential talent-related priority within their organization
* 3X more likely to use diversity metrics

“These findings highlight the urgent need for organizations to evolve their talent acquisition strategies and leverage technology to stay competitive in today’s job market,” stated Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator and CEO of HR.com. “The talent war is only intensifying, and organizations that continue to approach hiring reactively will struggle to secure top candidates.”
