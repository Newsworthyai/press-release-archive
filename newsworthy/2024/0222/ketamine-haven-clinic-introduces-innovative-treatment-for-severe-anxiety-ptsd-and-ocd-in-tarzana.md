This cutting-edge approach offers hope to individuals who have not found success with traditional treatments.

Recent studies reveal that severe anxiety affects a significant portion of the population, yet only 37% of those affected seek treatment. Acknowledging the profound impact this condition can have on daily life, Ketamine Haven Clinic now provides a breakthrough solution to address severe anxiety disorders that do not respond to conventional therapies. Ketamine infusion therapy has proven to be highly effective by targeting glutamate, a neurotransmitter responsible for stress responses and traumatic memory formation. With both antidepressant and anti-anxiety properties, ketamine offers immediate relief for up to seven days.

Post-traumatic stress disorder is a debilitating anxiety disorder that can arise after a traumatic event, affecting up to 20% of adults in the United States. The experts at Ketamine Haven Clinic have witnessed the remarkable benefits of ketamine infusion therapy in alleviating PTSD symptoms. By modulating stress responses and traumatic memories, ketamine emerges as a valuable option for individuals with severe anxiety who have not responded to traditional treatments.

In addition to PTSD, the clinic's low-dose ketamine infusion treatments have been successful in managing obsessive-compulsive disorder. Estimated to impact approximately 2.2 million adults annually, OCD is characterized by intrusive thoughts and disruptive repetitive behaviors. Leveraging ketamine's unique antidepressant and anti-anxiety properties, Ketamine Haven Clinic offers a groundbreaking solution to help patients mitigate the symptoms of OCD and regain control of their lives.
