# Garden Society Expands Portfolio with the Strategic Acquisition of Craft Cannabis Brand Chemistry

Santa Rosa, California (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Feb 22, 2024 @ 3:10 PM Pacific — "The acquisition enables Garden Society to scale its product lineup and reach a wider demographic as we amplify the values we believe should characterize the craft community."

Garden Society, a woman-owned brand renowned for its award-winning edibles, proudly announces the acquisition of Chemistry in an all-equity deal. Through this strategic move, the Sonoma-based company adds manufacturing expertise and expands its categories with tinctures, cartridges and other artisanal products.

"Our brands are connected by shared values like craft legacy and staying true to the plant, yet we've traditionally offered different product categories," says Erin Gore, CEO and Founder of Garden Society. "The acquisition enables Garden Society to scale its product lineup and reach a wider demographic as we amplify the values we believe should characterize the craft community."

Established the same year in 2016, Garden Society and Chemistry built their brands on a foundation of small-batch production, sustainable farming practices and full-spectrum cannabis products. The aligned ethos allows Chemistry to integrate seamlessly into Garden Society's licensed manufacturing supply chain and distribution channels in California and Ohio. Both brands will make their East Coast debut this spring in the surging New Jersey market.

Garden Society also welcomes Paul Roethle, CEO and Founder of Chemistry, to its executive team as Vice President of Product.

"Drawing from our shared engineering and science backgrounds, Erin and I always held a mutual admiration for each other's brands, and I am thrilled that Chemistry is now part of Garden Society," adds Roethle, who earned a PhD in Organic Chemistry from UC-Berkeley. "Our synergies and objectives are fully aligned to bring consumers the pinnacle of science and nature working in harmony."

Started as a bespoke women's brand nestled in wine country, Garden Society has grown into a nationally recognized company that's celebrated for its delicious edibles and strain-specific offerings. Chemistry, the company's first acquisition, further propels Garden Society on its journey to share craft values and products across multiple markets and categories.
