# AI Brainstorm Creator is Conducting the World's Largest Experiment ever on Recommended Daily Allowances for Emotions

Palo Alto, California (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Feb 22, 2024 @ 10:03 AM Pacific â€” NGO AI Brainstorm Creator has begun the fourth cohort of its worldwide experiment to determine if there is a Recommended Daily Allowance for emotional peak experiences. "We have known for a century that there is an RDA for dietary nutrients", says co-founder Amy Chang, "but recently it has appeared reasonable to assume that it's beneficial to think of psychological experiences in the same way. Since we have the ability to induce intense emotions, and to heighten their effect by making sure they are derived from daily global group experiences which achieve meaningful goals, there is every reason to believe that doing so accelerates individual and global improvement. It's a modern equivalent of Joseph Campbell's 'Hero's Journey'.

Key to the program's success is that participants actively seek to engender the most powerful emotions in OTHERS before prompting them in themselves. "They say it's better to give than to receive" says the ABC's Education Director Savithri Patel, "and we amend that to say that when you first help ANOTHER to delve deeply into a peak experience, you also induce the same thing in yourself. You can't abet Gratitude, Awe, or Laughter in others without also activating it in yourself."

Some of the fourth cohort's experiments include:

GRATITUDE - Members in 27 countries celebrate together live streams of the very first shared moments between parent and child in the largest maternity hospital in the Philippines, in which a baby is born every 7 minutes.

BRAINSTORMING - AI-assisted group mind mapping takes place during Zoom calls, using generateideas.ai. Participants are creating 170 mind maps for each of the UN's sub-targets within the 17 Agenda for Sustainability Goals. Actionable solutions that come out of the sessions are a side benefit. The real success is sharpening both swarm and artificial intelligence.

AWE - Hundreds of wonder-inspiring online experiences are examined monthly, and the best are 'upvoted' like posts on Reddit. Consistent winners include explore.org, which features 82 live webcam streams of wildlife all over the world, fresh images from the James Webb Space Telescope, and infinite regression video zoomquilt2.com.

LAUGHTER - Participants join laughter yoga club meetings on Zoom or Skype in 27 different countries. https://www.laughteryoga.org/club/find-clubs-worldwide/

COMMUNAL SELF-SACRIFICE, or Heroism - Participants partner with students at the Herat Girls School in Afghanistan to find and publicize little-known heroes on heroaward.net.

AI Brainstorm Creator realized early on that effects would not be long-lasting and permanently edifying unless:

1. Peak experiences could be shared and reinforced with hundreds around the world at the same time

2. Insights derived from meetings could be evaluated, refined, and improved daily using both AI and human intelligence;

3. Participants could learn from the basic peak experiences so that they could soon create their OWN individualized emotions and share them with the world

What study members are discovering is that once they become proficient at co-creating daily emotional peak experiences with their foreign friends, they note that a desire for whatever psychological event would be ideal for the present moment just naturally arises. As AI and social media tools evolve, it becomes easier and easier to call up these experiences upon demand.

" People wonder about their Life's purpose," says ABC Innovation Director John Toomey. "When they engage in projects like these consistently, the question goes away. It's not so much that you FIND the meaning of life, it's just that if within the scope of every day you are contributing to thousands around the globe through co-creating masterpieces of laughter, awe, heroism, brainstorming, and gratitude, the question starts to fade and eventually loses meaning. When the new mother gazes at her infant for the first time, she doesn't need to ask about life's purpose."
