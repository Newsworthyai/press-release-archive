# The New Brain Institute Introduces Breakthrough TMS Treatment for Depression

Beverly Hills, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Feb 22, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Eastern â€” The New Brain Institute, a prominent mental health clinic, is excited to announce the incorporation of Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) into its innovative suite of treatments for depression. TMS, a non-invasive procedure, utilizes magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain, effectively alleviating symptoms of depression. This cutting-edge therapy targets specific brain regions associated with decreased activity in individuals experiencing depression and serves as a viable option when other treatment methods have proven ineffective.

In addition to offering TMS treatment for depression, The New Brain Institute specializes in addressing various mental health challenges such as anxiety, cognitive enhancement, dementia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), smoking cessation, as well as ketamine therapy and medication management. Dr. Jack's remarkable expertise and dedication to patient care have positioned The New Brain Institute at the forefront of mental health services.

Patients who have undergone Deep TMS at The New Brain Institute have reported remarkable improvements in their overall well-being. Several patients have even provided heartfelt video testimonials, sharing their personal success stories and expressing gratitude for the institute's commitment to their recovery.

To enhance accessibility, The New Brain Institute accepts most major insurance carriers and offers complimentary insurance verification to prospective patients, aiming to make mental health treatment as attainable as possible. Their well-appointed facility in Beverly Hills, California, provides a comfortable and supportive environment for patients seeking transformative treatment options.
