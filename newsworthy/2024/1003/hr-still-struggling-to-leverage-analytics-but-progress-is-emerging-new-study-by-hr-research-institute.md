# HR Still Struggling to Leverage Analytics, but Progress Is Emerging - New Study by HR Research Institute

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Oct 3, 2024 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — The latest study from HR.com’s HR Research Institute (HRRI) highlights the fact that most organizations fail to use people analytics very effectively. In fact, only 22% of companies report being "very" or "extremely" effective at getting the most out of their HR analytics capabilities, despite noticeable improvements in data gathering and evaluation over the past few years.

The good news is that half of HR professionals (50%) now rate their organization’s data evaluation and understanding capabilities for people analytics as 'good' or 'very good,' marking a significant rise from 36% in 2021.

However, while data evaluation skills are improving, many organizations still face challenges in optimizing the potential of their people analytics. One key reason for this perceived ineffectiveness is the failure to integrate business data with HR data. The study revealed that only about a fifth of organizations consistently integrate business data with people data, limiting their ability to gain a comprehensive understanding of the workforce in relation to broader business objectives.

The study identifies the top three key challenges in people analytics that organizations continue to face:

* Integrating disparate sources of data – 47% of respondents noted difficulties in bringing together data from different systems.
* Implementing programs based on analytics-derived decisions – 41% of organizations struggle with turning insights into actionable programs.
* Distribution and communication of data – 33% of HR professionals highlighted the challenge of effectively sharing data insights within their organization.

"While we've seen clear progress in how organizations gather and analyze HR data, there’s still a long way to go in terms of translating those insights into actionable strategies," stated Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator and CEO of HR.com. "The challenge now is moving beyond data collection and ensuring that organizations can make data-driven decisions that lead to real business impact."
