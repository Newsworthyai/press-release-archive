# Interest Grows in Second Solar Tsunami Tower After Solar Electric Supply’s Successful Solar System Installation by the Shoalwater Indian Tribe

Scotts Valley, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Dec 4, 2024 @ 6:00 AM Pacific — Solar Electric Supply (SES), a leading provider of innovative solar energy solutions, is pleased to announce the success of its solar-powered critical backup power system installation for the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe's tsunami evacuation tower in Tokeland, Washington. This groundbreaking project, originally completed in 2021 and funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), continues to stand as the first tsunami evacuation tower of its kind in the United States.

The Shoalwater Bay Tribe's solar-powered tower has now garnered renewed interest from nearby tribes, as the project’s success has prompted interest in the possibility of a second solar-powered tsunami evacuation tower in the region. The remarkable performance of the tower’s backup power system has proven crucial for ensuring community safety during seismic and tsunami threats.

In collaboration with Degenkolb Engineering, a renowned engineering firm founded in 1940, SES developed an outdoor-rated UPS power system to provide emergency lighting and radio communications during a tidal wave event. The custom-designed AC-DC Outdoor UPS System features UL Listed Lithium Battery & Electronics outdoor-rated enclosures prewired with AC and DC distribution, overload, and surge protection. The system seamlessly switches between grid power and backup power, ensuring uninterrupted operation during power outages.

"This allows folks, even if it's 2:30 in the morning in your pajamas, to scoop up your family and make it here in a very short amount of time – in under a 15-minute window for nearly everyone from Tokeland Point to the heart of the reservation," said Lee Shipman, Shoalwater Bay Tribe Executive Director.The backup power system incorporates advanced Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries by Discover Energy, delivering 16 hours of emergency power for critical loads using eight 24VDC batteries with a total capacity of 22.4 kWh. The Schneider Electric Conext 4 kW DC to AC Sine Wave Inverter provides reliable AC power for the backup emergency lighting system, while the TDK Lambda 250W DC to DC converter powers the critical wireless radio equipment.

"We are proud to have played a crucial role in this groundbreaking project," said Garrett Gettleman, CEO of Solar Electric Supply. "Our expertise in designing reliable and efficient power solutions for critical infrastructure has enabled us to provide the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe with a robust backup power system that ensures the safety and well-being of their community during potential tsunami events."The tsunami evacuation tower, standing at 50 feet tall, offers a safe haven for the Tokeland community, which is susceptible to tsunamis. The tower's design is the result of extensive research by FEMA and NOAA on building structures capable of withstanding earthquake and tsunami forces. Guided by the Washington Emergency Management Division's Project Safe Haven, the project involved vulnerability assessments, evacuation planning, and vertical evacuation needs assessments. The successful completion of the project was also made possible through the valuable local logistical and contractor electrical materials support provided by Stusser Electric/CED.

Lee Shipman, Shoalwater Bay Tribe's executive director, expressed gratitude for the collaboration, stating, "The very best experts in the USA helped with this project. It is with the help from all the various agencies that we were able to build the very, very first FEMA-funded tower in the United States of America."

"We need about 50 more," followed up Major General Bret Daugherty, the head of the Washington National Guard and state Military Department, which houses the Emergency Management Division.

SES’s innovative backup power system ensures that the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe's tsunami evacuation tower remains operational, providing a safe haven for the community during a potential tsunami event. The success of this project has sparked renewed interest in the development of a second solar-powered tsunami evacuation tower nearby, further demonstrating the lasting impact of this important initiative.
