# Volition Beauty Introduces Skin Rhythm™ Balancing & Clearing Cleanser

Los Angeles, California (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Dec 4, 2024 @ 7:00 AM America/Mexico_City — Volition Beauty, renowned for its collaborative approach to beauty innovation, is thrilled to announce the launch of Skin Rhythm™ Balancing & Clearing Cleanser. Co-created with OB-GYN Dr. Jacqueline Walters, known for her groundbreaking work and role on Married to Medicine, this transformative cleanser (MSRP $35 / 4 fl oz) is designed to tackle adult skin challenges linked to hormonal imbalances.

This innovative formula is inspired by Dr. Walters’ prescription-based cleanser, reimagined as a clean, cosmetic-grade product to correct and regulate skin issues caused by hormonal imbalances without sacrificing effectiveness. Its powerful yet gentle ingredients, including Niacinamide, Salicylic Acid, and Bakuchiol, target adult acne, uneven skin tone, excess sebum, and dryness, making it suitable for even eczema-prone or irritated skin.

Key Benefits:

* Improves the look of blemishes
* Improves the appearance of discoloration, dark spots & acne scars
* Hydrates dryness & balances oiliness
* Visibly brightens and evens skin tone
* Helps minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles

Ingredients:

* Salicylic Acid - a BHA that exfoliates dead cells from the top layer of the epidermis and minimizes the appearance and spread of blemishes
* Mandelic Acid - an AHA that lifts away surface skin cells and provides age-defying benefits
* Azelaic Acid - brightens the skin tone while visibly improving skin texture and reducing the look of blemishes
* Niacinamide - balances oil, diminishes the appearance of acne scars, and reinforces the skin barrier function
* CoQ10 - strengthens skin's barrier function, helps neutralize free radicals, and reduces visible signs of aging

Available now on volitionbeauty.com and ulta.com, the Skin Rhythm™ Cleanser complements Dr. Walters’ bestselling 2021 Skin Rhythm™ Balancing & Clearing Serum.

Dr. Walters, a passionate advocate for women’s health and confidence, said, “Speaking with my patients in the office, it became apparent that I needed to create a cleanser for hormonal skin to accompany my Skin Rhythm Serum.”
