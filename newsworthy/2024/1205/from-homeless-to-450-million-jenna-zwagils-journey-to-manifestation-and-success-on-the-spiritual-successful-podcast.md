# From Homeless to $450 Million: Jenna Zwagil’s Journey to Manifestation and Success on The Spiritual Successful Podcast

Fort Lauderdale, FL (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Dec 5, 2024 @ 6:00 AM Pacific — Jenna Zwagil, host of The Spiritual Successful Podcast, is on a mission to teach others how to manifest their dreams after overcoming incredible personal challenges. From periods of homelessness to becoming a multi-millionaire entrepreneur, Jenna has proven that with the right mindset, anything is possible. In her first episodes of the new series, she shares her powerful journey and the mindset shifts that led to her extraordinary success.

Jenna's story is one of resilience and transformation. Starting with nothing but a car, she rose to become a top-income earner in network marketing, achieving a staggering $1 million per month in earnings. She credits much of her success to the guidance of Bob Proctor, one of the world’s leading personal development mentors.

“I was homeless, I had nothing, but I was determined to change my life. Through studying Bob Proctor’s teachings on manifestation, I learned how to unlock my potential,” Jenna says. “Now, my purpose is to help others ignite that same fire within themselves.”Through her journey, Jenna discovered the power of the law of vibration, a key concept she teaches on the podcast. Everything, from our thoughts to our emotions, has its own frequency, and aligning our personal frequency with our desires is essential to manifesting the life we want. "Your vibe attracts your tribe,” Jenna explains. “When you align your energy with your goals, you become a magnet for success.”

In one powerful episode, Jenna teaches listeners how to overcome fear, using a personal experience on a roller coaster to illustrate how facing our fears can lead to freedom and growth. “Fear is natural, but we can’t let it stop us. Once we face our fears, we realize that the life we truly desire is just beyond them,” Jenna reflects.

In addition to sharing her personal journey, Jenna also provides practical tools for achieving financial freedom. After her success in network marketing, Jenna transitioned to cryptocurrency trading, where she recently earned over $39,000 in just one week. Through her business, TradeX Mastery, she offers people the opportunity to start trading with small investments, showing them how to harness the power of the markets.

“Success isn’t just about wealth—it’s about what we can do with it," said Jenna. "Through my journey, I’ve learned that success is rooted in overcoming fear, aligning with our true desires, and manifesting the life we want. If I can do it, anyone can.”

Through The Spiritual Successful Podcast, Jenna continues to inspire listeners to push past limitations, embrace their potential, and create a life that aligns with their highest goals. Her message is clear: no matter where you start, success is attainable with the right mindset and actions.

“It’s crucial to push past the self-limiting mindset that holds so many people back," said Brandy A. Babin, president of CannabisRadio. "Who better to distill these lessons than someone who’s walked this path in multiple major market segments and given thousands of others the same opportunities? Jenna’s story is living proof that no matter where you start, with the right mindset and determination, anything is possible.”
