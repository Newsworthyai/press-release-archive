Standing out as a non-invasive depression treatment, Interventional Psychiatry of Arizona utilizes MRI technology to provide relief to patients who have not found success with traditional methods like antidepressant medications and psychotherapy. This therapy has shown promising results in treating various mental health challenges, including anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. TMS Therapy is not only side effect-free but also non-invasive and medication-free, covered by most insurances and Medicare.

What distinguishes TMS Therapy is its complete lack of side effects, making it an appealing choice for patients seeking alternatives to traditional treatments. Its non-invasive nature minimizes discomfort and eliminates the need for anesthesia, prioritizing patient comfort. Furthermore, the accessibility of TMS Therapy is ensured by its coverage under most insurance plans and Medicare, making it available to a wide range of patients.

The procedure involves the application of magnetic pulses to specific brain regions associated with mood regulation. During treatment, patients simply remove any sensitive objects, like jewelry, ensuring a safe experience. Earplugs are provided for comfort and hearing protection.

Administered by a trained TMS technician under the close supervision of a TMS physician, the therapy offers personalized settings, ensuring the precise amount of energy required for optimal results.
