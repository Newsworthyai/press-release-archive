# RChilli’s Master Stroke In Oracle Recruiting- RChilli Candidate Recharge

San Ramon, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Jan 17, 2024 @ 9:45 AM Central — After announcing its success story of becoming the default parsing solution in Oracle Recruiting Booster, RChilli has added to its list of crowning strokes, the release of RChilli Candidate Recharge (RCR).

A member of Oracle Partner Network (OPN), RChilli intends to revolutionize the way Oracle companies and talent acquisition professionals keep their candidate database clean. Understanding how candidate databases can become messy easily and quickly, and how recruiters spend more time looking for new candidates rather than searching their internal database, RChilli has engineered RCR.

A turn-key package, RChilli Candidate Recharge intends to solve the hassles faced by Oracle recruiters at each level with its suite of solutions:

* Bulk Profile Import: This allows Recruiters to easily upload resumes or email resumes to create candidate profiles in your Oracle environment. The hiring managers can easily upload 1-30 resumes at a time & create 1-30 candidate profiles.
* Redaction & Templatization: Allows for a redacted / templatized resume for non-biased recruiting to be attached to the candidate's profile in Oracle. RChilli creates a template for each resume, branded for individual companies to avoid a consistent resume format & look.
* Taxonomy: Get full access to RChilli’s expansive Taxonomy library to enrich Candidate Data sets. It allows for proprietary modifications to skills, titles, etc. for each organization that can be edited according to specific job titles.
* Quarterly Data Reprocessing: RChilli Performs the Data Reprocessing on the client's database on a quarterly schedule, ensuring that all candidate information fields are populated. Once the company edits its taxonomy, RChilli reprocesses the candidate database to ensure all candidates have the latest details.
* Annual Data Enrichment: RChilli utilizes its robust capabilities to enhance and refresh candidate data from multiple channels, such as Full Contact, Twofer, Lusha, and others. The goal of the company is to update candidate data so that each candidate is contactable.

Sharing his views on the latest developments, Josh Adams, Director of ERP Operations at RChilli says, “RCR is an important package since it makes it easier for recruiters to do their jobs with bulk profile import, redaction & templatization gives them the ability of unbiased hiring. Taxonomy gives them the ability to have skills appear as they want, most importantly, if they’re using employee enhancement tools, RCR feeds the latest information into that, making it up to date & fresh.”
