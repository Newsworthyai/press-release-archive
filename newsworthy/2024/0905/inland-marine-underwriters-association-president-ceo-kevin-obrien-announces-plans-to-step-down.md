# Inland Marine Underwriters Association President & CEO Kevin O’brien Announces Plans To Step Down

New York, NY (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Sep 5, 2024 @ 6:00 AM Pacific — Kevin O’Brien, President and CEO of the Inland Marine Underwriters Association (IMUA), announced that he will step down from his role on January 31, 2025. During a recent Executive Committee meeting, O’Brien informed IMUA’s officers of his intentions. After 14 years at the helm, he will be pursuing new opportunities outside the organization.

IMUA is an insurance company trade association focused on championing the interests of the inland marine insurance industry and fostering industry professionals' education and professional development. IMUA serves 54 member insurance companies, 45 associate members, and over 4,000 of their employees.

Throughout his tenure, O’Brien led numerous initiatives that significantly expanded the association’s influence, enhanced member services, and bolstered its financial stability. Notably, he pioneered the development of all-access remote education and e-learning programs, which have become integral to IMUA’s mission. His exceptional leadership and unwavering commitment have solidified IMUA’s role as a cornerstone of professional development within the industry.

“When I assumed this role, I set out with two primary goals: to establish IMUA as the standard for professional development within the industry and to strengthen the organization’s financial foundation. I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished. Membership is at an all-time high, including adding five national brokers, and our financial position is stronger than ever. The All Access Learning platform offers complimentary remote and virtual education, which has been a resounding success. Attendance at our Annual Meeting, the industry’s premier educational symposium, has more than doubled from 200 to over 400 attendees. As we prepare to launch a new Association Management System (AMS) alongside an integrated Learning Management System (LMS), I’m more optimistic about the association’s future than ever before. It’s been an incredible 14-year journey, and now the time is right for passing the torch,” said O’Brien.
