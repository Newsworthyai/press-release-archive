# Is Brushing & Flossing Alone The Best Way To Prevent Periodontal Disease? Maybe Not.

Boynton Beach, FL (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Aug 15, 2024 @ 10:00 AM Eastern — For years, dental professionals have advised patients that brushing and flossing are the cornerstones of effective oral hygiene. But is that enough? According to a new article in Digital Dentistry & Healthcare Knowledge (DDHKMAGAZINE.COM VOL. 4 ISSUE 01 SUMMER 2024), it might not be. This publication for dental professionals reviews the causes of periodontal and peri-implant diseases and explores measures to prevent implant loss.

The entitled Peri-Implant Disease: What your patient can do to prevent losing the implant; What you can do to prevent losing the patient raises concerns about the effectiveness of brushing and flossing alone in reducing dental plaque. “Periodontal and peri-implant destruction occurs daily,” says ioTech International’s Chairman, Herb Moskowitz, DDS. He emphasizes, “The best defense against these diseases is a daily regimen that includes brushing, flossing, and antibacterial rinsing.”

In a six-month study with over 300 dental patients, brushing and rinsing were found to be 18 times more effective than brushing and flossing. Another second study showed that brushing and rinsing were six times more effective in reducing dental plaque. Additionally, an examination of 160 dental patients demonstrated that brushing and rinsing were far more effective in reducing plaque and inflammation, as measured by the Plaque Index, the Modified Gingival Index, and the Bleeding Index.

Moskowitz highlights the importance of including rinsing in daily oral hygiene routines. Home gingival irrigation, with an oral irrigating device or water flosser, can significantly enhance oral health. The article notes that using a rinsing agent alone can reach depths of 21% of a 6mm pocket, but when combined with an oral irrigator, it can get 90% of that same pocket.

“Now that it is established that rinsing and subgingival irrigation are critical to successful periodontal and peri-implant disease prevention, it is equally important to use the most effective oral rinse or oral irrigant. Not all oral rinses are alike,” says Moskowitz. “Molecular iodine has proven to be far more effective than any other professional rinse in keeping gums healthy.”

The Digital Dentistry & Healthcare Knowledge article compares various antiseptic rinses against major bacterial pathogens—Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella. Both pathogens are primarily responsible for periodontal disease, and Fusobacterium is also directly linked to colon cancer. The results clearly documented “a tremendous difference in efficacy amongst the tested antiseptic rinses, ranging from complete inactivation of both pathogenic bacteria by the molecular iodine rinse to no biocidal activity, at all by a stabilized chlorine dioxide rinse against Prevotella intermedia. The molecular iodine rinse was the only rinse to completely inactivate both bacteria.” Click the following link and scroll down to page 31 to review the comparative efficacy of each tested antiseptic rinse. https://bit.ly/3WHoznH.

Molecular iodine has emerged as a highly effective agent in preventing peri-implant disease. Unlike traditional antiseptics, molecular iodine offers broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity with no resistance development. Its potent antimicrobial properties are effective against bacteria, viruses, and fungi, which are often implicated in peri-implant diseases. Molecular iodine disrupts the cell walls of these pathogens, leading to rapid microbial death and reducing biofilm formation on implant surfaces. Additionally, its use as a rinse or irrigant is well-tolerated by patients, with no irritation or staining compared to other antiseptics.

The ioTech International Chairman agrees, noting, “By integrating molecular iodine into regular oral hygiene practices, patients can enhance the longevity of their dental implants and maintain better overall oral health.” He points out that as many as 75% of all US adults have some form of gum disease. It is an insidious disease where many adults are not even aware of their worsening condition until their teeth become loose and abscesses form. Implant failures are also occurring at an alarming rate, and he noted that an analysis of almost 12,000 functioning dental implants revealed that almost 50% of those implants had developed peri-implant disease. He further noted that “ironically, many of those expensive implants could have been saved with simple home oral hygiene care incorporating an effective antibacterial rinse.” After several years of development of its molecular iodine oral care products, ioTech International was issued its first patent in 2018.

Among the ioTech molecular iodine rinses currently available is a complete line of ioRinseR mouth rinses, ioRinseR Ultra, for controlling dental plaque and gingivitis, and the recently introduced ioRinseR MR for use with mouth and canker sores, dry mouth, oral pain, and oral ulcers. Cancer patients often develop severe mouth ulcers resulting from their chemotherapy or radiation treatment. ioRinse MR provides profound relief to these patients. The Company plans to introduce ioRinseR AC anti-cavity mouth rinse in September.

Among the benefits of ioRinse Ultra molecular iodine rinse, are the following:

* Safe and easy to use
* Efficacy tested and proven more effective than any other tested rinse in destroying periodontal bacteria in laboratory testing
* Helps prevent periodontal and peri-implant diseases
* Anti-plaque, anti-gingivitis
* Effectively promotes gum (perio) health
* Does not cause microbial resistance like other antiseptic rinses
* Non-staining, pleasant-tasting formulation
* Cost-effective routine preventative care
* Long-lasting breath freshener

The article concludes by noting that a proper oral hygiene regime can also lead to better overall health. “Periodontal bacteremias are closely linked to Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, and a myriad of other debilitating diseases.”
