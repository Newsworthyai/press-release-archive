# New Technology Provides Hope for Millions of Dogs and Cats Ravaged with Gum Disease

Boynton Beach, Fl (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Dec 18, 2024 @ 9:00 AM Eastern — According to holistic veterinarian Dr. Babette Gladstein, “Alarmingly, as many as 85% of dogs develop some form of gum disease by the age of two. Despite being the most diagnosed condition in dogs and cats, it often goes untreated until it progresses to an advanced stage.”

Consequently, periodontal disease remains the most neglected health issue in animals. If left untreated, gum disease can lead to serious health consequences, such as oral infections, tooth loss, and an increased risk of localized cancer. More severe complications may involve kidney, liver, lung, and heart diseases, as well as diabetes.

“The buildup of dental plaque in dogs and cats is the primary factor in the development of periodontal disease. If not effectively removed every day, severe periodontal disease and related tooth loss can occur," Dr. Gladstein adds.What You Can DoNoted dental educator, research scientist, and Chairman of ioTech International, Herb Moskowitz, DDS, points out, “There used to be only one option to help reduce plaque -- diligently brush your pet’s teeth daily. However, uncooperative pets and the challenge of daily brushing lead to unsatisfactory results. And brushing less frequently can result in even poorer outcomes.”

Dr. Moskowitz adds, “Fortunately, that daily brushing hassle is no longer necessary because a major technological breakthrough and recent clinical studies confirm that adding a nutritional amount of the essential nutrient molecular iodine to your pet’s drinking water each day is far more effective in reducing dental plaque than if a veterinarian supervised the brushing of your pet’s teeth.”

ioTech International’s latest patented oral care product, ioVet™ Oral, is the first drinking water additive of its kind for canines and felines. It is specifically designed for periodontal care. It contains molecular iodine (I2), which is more effective at reducing plaque than daily brushing and provides pets with clinically proven healthier mouths and fresher breath.

The effectiveness of molecular iodine (I2) in pet drinking water was assessed in recent clinical trials following VOHC guidelines. Dr. Moskowitz states, “Two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies were conducted using molecular iodine as a drinking water additive to control dental plaque formation and inhibit periodontal disease. The dogs’ drinking water was dosed once daily with a nutritional amount of molecular iodine. Twenty-five kenneled dogs on controlled diets participated in each 28-day clinical study. The iodinated drinking water was well tolerated, and all oral mouth odor was eliminated, as observed in the study dogs.”

Plaque reductions averaging 44% were observed over 28 days in dogs treated with molecular iodine compared to those given a placebo. These results significantly exceed those achieved through daily veterinarian-supervised teeth brushing for dogs. The test results were so remarkable that the molecular iodine water additive received the VOHC Seal of Acceptance for Plaque Control.

Simple, Effective CareSimple to use, add 1 milliliter (ml) of ioVet™ Oral for each 8 oz. of water to your pet's water dish each morning. Each package provides a syringe to ensure the proper amount of ioVet™ Oral is dispensed into the water dish.

Among the benefits of molecular iodine for pets are:

* Safe and easy to use
* Clinically proven based on Veterinary Oral Health Council (VOHC) approved studies
* Effectively promotes periodontal health
* More effective than daily brushing
* Nutritional
* Does not cause microbial resistance

“Despite our best efforts, periodontal disease in dogs and cats has reached epidemic proportions. Fortunately, a few drops per day of ioVet™ Oral is an effective, easy-to-use option that can play a key role in a healthier and happier pet companion,” concludes Dr. MoskowitzFor more information, visit the company's website at www.iotechinternational.com or iovetproducts.com.
