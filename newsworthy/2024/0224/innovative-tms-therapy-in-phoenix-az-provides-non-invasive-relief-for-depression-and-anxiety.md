# Innovative TMS Therapy in Phoenix, AZ Provides Non-Invasive Relief for Depression and Anxiety

Phoenix, AZ (Newsworthy.ai) Saturday Feb 24, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Eastern â€” Interventional Psychiatry of Arizona is revolutionizing the way mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, OCD, and PTSD, are treated. Utilizing cutting-edge MRI technology, TMS Therapy offers a non-invasive and side-effect-free alternative to traditional treatments, providing significant relief for patients.

TMS Therapy has demonstrated outstanding results, with 50-60% of patients experiencing noteworthy alleviation of depressive symptoms, and an impressive 30-40% achieving complete resolution. Unlike other treatment options, TMS Therapy does not require medication and is considered safe for long-term use.

TMS Therapy is a game-changer in the field of mental health. It harnesses the power of MRI technology, specifically repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), to initiate positive changes in brain activity, particularly in the areas associated with mood regulation. It's a remarkable option for patients who haven't found relief through traditional methods.

When opting for rTMS, patients undergo a procedure that involves the use of MRI technology applied to specific regions of the brain associated with mood regulation. During the treatment, patients are required to remove sensitive objects, wear earplugs for comfort and hearing protection, and have measurements taken on the scalp to determine the treatment area. The entire procedure is administered by a qualified technician under the supervision of a TMS physician.

TMS Therapy is covered by most insurances and Medicare, providing accessible treatment options to a wide range of individuals. While coverage for off-label treatments may vary, the availability of insurance coverage helps make this innovative treatment more accessible for those in need.

TMS Therapy is a beacon of hope for individuals who have exhausted traditional avenues for combating mental health conditions. With minimal to no side effects, this groundbreaking treatment offers a new lease on life for patients who are committed to achieving long-term mental health.
