# Synchrony Brain Health Introduces Breakthrough Treatment Option: dTMS Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

Evanston, IL (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Feb 14, 2024 @ 4:00 PM Australia/Perth â€” Synchrony Brain Health, a trailblazer in innovative mental health solutions, is delighted to announce the introduction of a groundbreaking treatment known as deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (dTMS). This non-invasive therapy holds promise in assisting individuals diagnosed with a broad spectrum of mental health and cognitive issues.

Understanding the crucial role of brain activity in mental health, dTMS is transforming the treatment landscape. Its ability to precisely target specific brain areas using magnetic fields offers hope to those who have not responded well to traditional treatments.

The potential applications of deep TMS therapy are extensive, with clinical evidence demonstrating its efficacy in diverse conditions. Patients diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder, depression, and even long COVID brain fog may find relief through this treatment modality. Furthermore, deep TMS shows promise in offering support to individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and conditions associated with chronic pain such as fibromyalgia and multiple sclerosis (MS).

With its non-invasive nature and minimal side effects, deep TMS therapy is emerging as a vital alternative to medications and other traditional treatment methods. By precisely targeting brain regions, it can restore ongoing neural dysfunctions and help individuals regain control over their mental health.
