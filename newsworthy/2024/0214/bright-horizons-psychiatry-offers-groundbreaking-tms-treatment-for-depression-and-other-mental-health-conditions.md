# Bright Horizons Psychiatry Offers Groundbreaking TMS Treatment for Depression and Other Mental Health Conditions

Rockville, MD (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Feb 15, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Australia/Perth â€” Bright Horizons Psychiatry, a leading psychiatric practice in Maryland, is delighted to announce the availability of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) as a noninvasive treatment option for individuals with treatment-resistant depression and other mental health conditions.

TMS is an innovative therapy that uses magnetic energy to stimulate specific regions of the brain that may not be functioning properly in individuals with mental health disorders. By delivering magnetic impulses, TMS reactivates dormant brain cells, improving brain function and transforming the way individuals think and feel.

The benefits of TMS have shown remarkable promise in the treatment of depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. It's noteworthy that TMS has also demonstrated significant efficacy in managing anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, PTSD, and certain personality disorders. When used alongside psychiatric medication, TMS can yield optimal results, offering a comprehensive approach to mental health treatment.

During a typical TMS session, patients are comfortably seated in a treatment chair while a magnetic coil is placed on their heads. The device is turned on, and patients can engage in activities such as reading or listening to music for approximately 20-30 minutes. The treatment is generally well-tolerated, with the most common side effects being mild headaches or tenderness, easily managed with over-the-counter pain relievers.

A standard TMS treatment plan initially involves five sessions per week for six weeks, followed by a tapering protocol. The effects of TMS can last between 6-12 months or longer, and if symptoms return, additional sessions can be safely administered.

Bright Horizons Psychiatry is thrilled to offer TMS as part of its comprehensive mental health treatment options. To learn more about TMS or to schedule an appointment, please visit www.brighthorizonpsychiatry.com.
