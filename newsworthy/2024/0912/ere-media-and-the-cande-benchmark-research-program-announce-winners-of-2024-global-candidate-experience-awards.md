# ERE Media and the CandE Benchmark Research Program Announce Winners of 2024 Global Candidate Experience Awards

New York, NY (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Sep 12, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Pacific — NEW YORK, Sept. 12, 2024 -- ERE Media, the longest running and most trusted source for information about recruitment, talent acquisition, and talent management, and the CandE Benchmark Research Program, today revealed the 62 companies from around the world to be recognized for candidate experience excellence as winners of 2024 Global Candidate Experience Awards.

This year 125 companies hiring around the world registered to participate in the 2024 Global ERE CandE Awards Benchmark Research Program, which ultimately collected the thoughts and experiences of over 230,000 job candidates. The largest study of its kind, the CandE Benchmark Research Program has evaluated responses from over 2,000 global employers and over 1.8 million job seekers since 2011.

Winners were identified through a comprehensive data analysis based on their job candidates' satisfaction survey scores. To qualify, each company committed to a statistically significant candidate response rate, where the proportion of respondents who were not hired met or exceeded a set standard. The final analysis included four key questions that had a significant impact on determining the winners:

1. The candidates' overall ranking of their candidate experience
2. Whether or not they would reapply to the organization in the future
3. Whether or not they would refer other job seekers to the organization in the future
4. And how the candidates would change their business relationship status with the organization going forward based on their experience

The above analysis resulted in a final CandE Score for each participating organization. This year 62 organizations big and small across multiple industries will receive 74 CandE Awards due to having the highest positive candidate experience ratings in North America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA); Asia-Pacific (APAC); and Latin America. The CandEs continue to see an increased focus on Candidate Experience and the value it brings to an organization.

"Candidate frustration and resentment is the highest we’ve ever seen in our research, and it continues to be a challenging year for recruiting and hiring professionals around the world due to leaner teams, fewer open jobs, and an increase in applications,” said Kevin Grossman, ERE Media VP of Research. “But many talent acquisition leaders and their teams in our CandE community have remained resilient and have worked hard to improve recruiting, hiring, and the candidate experience in a difficult market. We're grateful for all the companies that participated in our benchmark research this year."

You can find the complete listing of 2024 CandE Winners, and all past year winners, alphabetically and by final ranking on the ERE Media CandE Winner page.

CandE-winning companies are also asked about their unique approach to improving the candidate experience through case study questions that will be used for our research reports, as well as to be considered for the new Most Innovative Candidate Experience Improvement Awards to be given away at this year’s ERE Recruiting Conference and CandE Awards Celebration, November 12-14, 2024. Conference registration is open for all recruiting leaders and their teams.
