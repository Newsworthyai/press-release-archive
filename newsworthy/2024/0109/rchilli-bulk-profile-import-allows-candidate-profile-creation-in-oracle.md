# RChilli Bulk Profile Import - Allows Candidate Profile Creation In Oracle

San Ramon, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Jan 9, 2024 @ 6:00 AM Central — RChilli, a leading provider of advanced recruiting solutions for Oracle recruiting, has announced yet another groundbreaking solution, the Bulk Profile Import, designed to streamline the candidate profile creation process within Oracle. This innovative plugin enables recruiters to upload and create candidate profiles in Oracle effortlessly, making the hiring process more efficient and user-friendly.

The plugin ensures a fully secure connection to Oracle, allowing hiring managers and companies to log in via IDCS (Identity Cloud Service) and single sign-on using Oracle tokens.

Recruiters now have the flexibility to browse, upload, or drag and drop 1-30 resumes at a time. This seamless process simplifies the task of importing candidate information into Oracle.

What sets the path to a hassle-free candidate profile creation in Oracle is that the plugin offers a quick two-click process for parsing resumes. The first click allows hiring managers to parse the resumes via the "Import Resumes" option. Or, they can highlight the desired text from a candidate profile on external sources like Monster, CareerBuilder, or LinkedIn.

With both options, the plugin parses the information and creates a candidate profile with first and last name, email address, address, education, work history, languages spoken, licenses, certifications, and skills with detailed months and years of experience. All details are editable before finalizing the upload.

Proving the technical prowess of RChilli technical leaders is the second click feature of the extension- Email Integration. Registered users with full control can attach resumes to emails. The RChilli extension automatically grabs, parses, and loads the resumes into Oracle. Recruiters receive a comprehensive report detailing the uploaded resumes for easy tracking.

Josh Adams, Director of ERP Operations at RChilli, emphasizes the plugin's benefits, stating, "Within the admin panel, managers can run reports on all resumes loaded, whether through the resume upload extension or email. Our end goal is to make it easy for recruiters to add new candidates into Oracle."

He further states, “With the Bulk Profile Import plugin, RChilli aims to revolutionize the recruitment landscape, providing recruiters with a powerful tool to enhance their efficiency in candidate profile creation within the Oracle platform.”
