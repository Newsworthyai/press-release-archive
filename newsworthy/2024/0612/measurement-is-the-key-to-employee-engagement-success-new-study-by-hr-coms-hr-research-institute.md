# Measurement Is the Key to Employee Engagement Success - New Study by HR.com’s HR Research Institute

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Jun 12, 2024 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — Organizations with successful employee engagement initiatives are significantly more likely to record and track metrics. An impressive 88% of these companies measure engagement, compared to just 44% of those with lower engagement. This underscores the crucial role of analytics and data-driven decision-making in fostering an engaged and productive workforce.

The full research report, HR.com’s State of Employee Productivity and Engagement 2024, is available for free download to provide critical insights and actionable strategies for human resources (HR) professionals looking to improve engagement and productivity levels. This study examines current trends, challenges, and best practices to provide a comprehensive overview of how leading companies are successfully fostering engagement and boosting productivity.

Further analysis shows 87% of organizations measure employee productivity, but no single metric is universally used. The most common method is tracking goal completion. For employers that find it difficult to measure productivity, using goal completion, even as an estimate, can help managers assess productivity trends effectively.

The top three methods for helping companies boost productivity include the following more traditional tools and technology:

* document management and storage solutions (57%)
* collaboration and communication tools (55%)
* customer relationship management (47%)

"Management's support for utilizing metrics, technology, and AI-powered tools is essential for achieving high levels of employee engagement and productivity," stated Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator and CEO of HR.com. "To fully capitalize on these tools, we must also train our people, including managers, to use them effectively."

The full report, HR.com’s State of Employee Productivity and Engagement 2024, is available for download and provides actionable strategies and key takeaways to help understand and enhance employee engagement, driving productivity and business success.

The recording of the research presentation, Engagement in Action: From Data Insights to High-Performance Practices, is available for viewing 24/7 on demand.
