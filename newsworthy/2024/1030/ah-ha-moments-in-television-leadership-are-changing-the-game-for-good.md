# Ah-HA Moments in Television Leadership Are Changing The Game For Good

Dallas, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Oct 30, 2024 @ 7:00 AM US/Central — After a dramatic 4-year decline, television viewing is on the upswing, but it’s not traditional TV viewing that has the attention of every cultural makeup on the spectrum. According to Techreport.com, among several reasons, viewer habits have changed due to lifestyle and the desire for 'comfort' programming. Conservative viewers might add additional reasons for turning away from the channels they grew up with.

Today’s viewers globally are looking for more information than they can find on what the BBC refers to as the ‘Trusted News Initiative’. AP and Reuters, where most of what Americans hear parroted over traditional TV originates, under the guidance of the BBC, declared themselves the only trusted news authority, explaining why every outlet sounds strangely similar.

Those trusted points of view, conservatives might argue, have bled into the narratives that shape talk shows, documentaries, comic perspectives, and entertainment - painting our world with a very broad brush and diminishing thought leadership contradicting those narratives. That initiative hurt confidence levels, the people responded vehemently, and OBBM Network TV is stepping into the void - outside of orchestrated parameters.

Everyone is noticing - local confidence is the new gold. Today, earning their attention requires a steady hand, open ears and eyes, and a refusal to equate trust with top down headlines. As innovation would have it, OBBM Network TV and Media Liberty Alliance partners have broken into local markets on the city level to bring wholesome entertainment, family viewing, gritty commentary, and local government information to the masses through streaming 24/7 television available for 330 cities across the United States of America.

The concept is gaining traction with freedom loving people who are aware of the dollar journey. Local television media, ideally, should support local economies, and inform us about governmental interventions causing harm, neglect, or fraud. Today, local no longer means multiple county coverage. On a city level, people can understand their civics, hear boots on the ground news, discover businesses that appreciate their values, find content that applies to their location, and enjoy movies and shows that bring the family together.

OBBM Network TV broke out with 18 local channels across Dallas-Fort Worth over Q1 2024. Florida’s Space Coast, Brevard County, was the next to open, followed by Houston and Austin, Texas. Channels across Ohio, Colorado, and Wisconsin are in development, and with 300 communities to go, are taking television media back to their first amendment roots.

“We’re the other point of view, but we didn’t like what we saw on many alternative mediums either. Angry, while warranted, is not attractive and doesn’t build strong communities capable of withstanding global governance. We had to find a better way to strengthen conservative voices and we had to show our kids a better, higher quality of entertainment. We’re not done, but we’re getting there.” ~ Larry Kortkamp, OBBM Network TV

What does the future hold? Awards shows? Music television? Local communities boast talent and celebrity, and are happy to choose the hometown stars they clamor for.

Television advertising has been brought into the local level, highlighting everything it means to enjoy American freedom, and making it possible - and effective - to invest in local economies like our grandparents once did, and enjoy the return on growth.
