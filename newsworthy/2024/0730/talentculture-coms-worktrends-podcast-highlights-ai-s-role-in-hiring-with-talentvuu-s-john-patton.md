# TalentCulture.com’s WorkTrends Podcast Highlights AI's Role in Hiring with TalentVUU's John Patton

Portland, OR (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Jul 30, 2024 @ 6:00 AM Pacific — TalentCulture.com's #WorkTrends podcast recently hosted an engaging episode titled "Introducing AI as a Next-Gen Screening & Interviewing Tool," featuring John Patton of TalentVUU. The episode dives deep into how artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the screening and interviewing processes for hiring managers, recruiters, and talent management leaders.

Misconceptions About AI in Hiring

Addressing common misconceptions, Patton remarked, "Many people believe that AI interviewing is something for the future, something that’s coming soon, or something that’s around the corner. That simply is not true. AI is for the here and now – we need to take advantage of using it in the present."

Mr. Patton also compared the adoption of AI to past technological shifts, saying, "We all remember when the answering machine became popular. Everyone thought it was strange to leave a message for a friend or family member who wasn’t actually there. But after time, it quickly became normal."

Client Reactions to AI

When asked about initial reactions from managers and leaders using AI, Patton shared, "The initial reaction has been really positive! We’ve had people say, 'You’ve made my job fun again. AI interviewing is way better than you said it would be.' But my favorite reaction so far was a man who pulled his wife aside just to show her how exciting it was to be using AI."

Resolving Client Pain Points

Discussing the primary pain points TalentVUU aimed to resolve, Patton noted, "What we’re finding is that AI interviews can screen somebody right when they’re interested. You don’t have to schedule a meeting with them and they don’t have to schedule a meeting with you."

Embracing AI

On what prevents leaders from using AI for screenings and interviews, Patton stated, "The biggest hang-up is that people believe that to begin using an AI system, it will take some time. I like to tell our customers that the best way to start is by trying it out for themselves."
