# WHEN THE SAINTS COME LAUGHING IN. A Comedy Show About Grief and Loss

NEW ORLEANS, LA (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Jun 27, 2024 @ 12:15 PM Pacific — When life hurts, you’ll be glad When The Saints Come LAUGHING In! Death is an inevitable part of life, but we don’t always talk about it until faced with its realities. Grief and loss can be isolating, but laughter can be as cathartic as crying, especially when shared with others.

Comedians Jordon Ferber and Samantha Bednarz tackle tough topics in this one-night-only comedy extravaganza hosted by Alan Pedersen.

This year marks the 5th consecutive year that Jordon Ferber produces a comedy show to complement the annual national convention for The Compassionate Friends (TCF), a non-profit organization supporting bereaved parents, grandparents, and siblings across the U.S.

Comedy and tragedy are often intertwined, and we should rejoice in laughing at the darkest parts of our humanity.

The Compassionate Friends (TCF) 47th Annual National Conference, an event offering inspiration, support, and connection for those grieving the death of a child, grandchild, or sibling, is coming to New Orleans from July 12 – 14. The conference gathers over 1,000+ individuals from across North America in a supportive setting with others who understand the devastating loss of a child, grandchild, or sibling.

Attendees find renewed hope and support, as well as tools, information, and strategies for coping with grief. They make connections, find inspiration, and receive support and understanding. Lifelong friendships are formed and deepened each year at TCF conferences.

New Orleans’ resilience in the face of tragedy, rich traditions of remembering those who have died, and ability to rise from the devastation of loss make it the perfect location for this hopeful and supportive event.

The Compassionate Friends exists to provide highly personal comfort, hope, and support to bereaved parents, grandparents, and siblings, and to help family, friends, community members, and professionals better understand the impact of grief and how to help those who are grieving.

Event Details:

* Date: Thursday, July 11th
* Time: Doors open at 7pm, show at 8pm
* Location: The Howlin’ Wolf New Orleans, 907 S Peters Street
* Tickets: Available at https://laughlife.standuptix.com/events/when-the-saints-come-laughing-in
