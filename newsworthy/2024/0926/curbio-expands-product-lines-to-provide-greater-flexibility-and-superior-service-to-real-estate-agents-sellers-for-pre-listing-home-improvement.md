# Curbio Expands Product Lines to Provide Greater Flexibility and Superior Service to Real Estate Agents & Sellers for Pre-Listing Home Improvement

POTOMAC, MD (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Sep 26, 2024 @ 12:00 PM Central — Curbio, the leader in pre-listing home improvement, today announced a significant expansion of its product lines to offer greater options for pre-sale repair and renovation projects. For real estate agents, this expansion will enable them to tailor their project design even more specifically to their listings and to what their local market demands, offering another competitive edge as they incorporate Curbio’s pay-at-close pre-listing home improvement service into their marketing to win more listings and deliver high levels of service to their clients.

Curbio is a full-service home improvement company for pre-listing home updates ranging from repairs and cosmetic refreshes to large-scale renovations. One key component of its turnkey model is the inclusion of high-quality materials with every project. Curbio simplifies the traditionally long and labor-intensive process of selecting and sourcing materials by offering a wide range of materials and finishes that are in demand and immediately available.

The newly introduced Classic Line is designed to provide budget-friendly yet impactful updates based on buyer demand, allowing agents and their clients to make necessary updates before listing without compromising quality. Featuring trusted brands such as Glacier Bay, Delta, and Kohler, the Classic Line offers durable, cost-effective solutions for those seeking to achieve their selling goals with smart value.

Additionally, Curbio has enriched its Luxury Line with high-end finishes and premium brands including Wolf, Sub-Zero, Bosch, and Miele. These enhancements ensure that luxury home sellers and agents can work with Curbio to create an elevated design for listings and markets that call for the highest levels of discerning taste and luxury.

“Curbio’s mission is to modernize the pre-listing home improvement process, which includes offering the industry’s most flexible product and materials options for any listing at any price,” said Rick Rudman, President & CEO of Curbio. “With the launch of the Classic Line and the enhancement of our Luxury Line, we serve a broader range of clients and agents, helping them quickly prepare listings based on market demand with a design approach to achieve better sales outcomes for their listings.”

Curbio stays at the forefront of design trends, continuously expanding its offerings to offer materials, finishes, and design motifs that are tailored to what today’s buyers are looking for. As part of these expansions, Curbio has also strengthened its partnerships with suppliers such as Lowe’s and Home Depot, ensuring timely delivery and sufficient inventory across all product lines. Curbio has removed the financial and operational obstacles that have traditionally impacted the home improvement process with its pay-at-closing model and its full-service client experience, powered by technology and data. By offering timely delivery of an expanded range of materials, Curbio is further setting itself apart as real estate’s premier pre-listing home improvement partner to agents and clients.
