# Hometown or Cookie-Cutter Sprawl? Lisa Moretti Plans for Real Communities in Pasco County, Florida

Pasco County, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Sep 26, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Eastern — Lisa Moretti, candidate for Pasco County Commissioner District 1, is taking a stand against what she calls the “cookie-cutter sprawl” that is threatening the character of Pasco County. Moretti is pushing for “good growth” development that creates real communities—places where residents feel at home, not just another generic subdivision.

"The developments we’re seeing now could be anywhere in the country," Moretti said. "They don’t reflect the character of Pasco County or the desires of its residents. We deserve better. We need communities that have a sense of place and history, not just rows of identical houses with romanticized names that bear no resemblance to the land they’ve replaced."

Moretti’s plan for Pasco County includes implementing stricter development standards that encourage builders to create communities that reflect the county’s heritage and values. She believes that developers must work with the county to ensure that new projects align with the needs of local residents, while also preserving green spaces and protecting natural resources.

"Development should enhance our communities, not erase them," said Moretti. "We need a clear vision of what Pasco County should look like in the future, and we need to stick to that vision. Our comprehensive plan should be a tool for creating real communities that people are proud to call home, not changed at every meeting to rubber stamp another sprawl of lookalike neighborhoods."

Moretti is also advocating for a complete inventory of current development projects and available housing. This would provide county leaders and residents with a clearer picture of what has already been built and what is truly needed to meet the demands of Pasco County’s growing population.

"We’re building at a breakneck pace without even knowing what we already have," Moretti explained. "Before we break ground on any new developments, we need to assess what’s already here and figure out how we can improve it."

Her plan also calls for prioritizing infrastructure improvements in existing communities and holding developers accountable to higher standards for new projects. Moretti believes that by focusing on creating communities with character and a sense of identity, Pasco County can avoid becoming another casualty of unchecked suburban sprawl.

"Pasco County should be a place where people want to live, not just a place to build," Moretti said. "As county commissioner, I will fight for communities that reflect the values of our residents and preserve what makes Pasco County special."

Moretti’s vision for Pasco County includes thoughtful development that balances growth with sustainability. By encouraging smarter planning and stricter regulations, she believes the county can grow in a way that preserves its unique character and sense of place.
