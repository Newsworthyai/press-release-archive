Das GreenHaus and LOCOAL: A Partnership to benefit the Texas Hill Country

LOCOAL, an emerging technology company pioneering next-generation decarbonization and renewable energy solutions, today announced a strategic partnership with Das GreenHaus (DGH), a nonprofit business incubator serving early stage founders and aspiring entrepreneurs in the Texas Hill Country. Together, they aim to build networks and attract financial partners to bring LOCOAL’s new headquarters into the heart of the Texas Hill Country, strengthening the region's sustainability initiatives and economic growth.

“Das GreenHaus’ mission is being realized every day—connecting founders, investors, mentors, and community leaders who are passionate about innovation and have a deep love for the Hill Country,” said Justin McKenzie, Program Director and founding member of DGH. “Our vision is to create opportunities that benefit the entire region, and this partnership with LOCOAL exemplifies that goal.”

The Foundation of LOCOAL LOCOAL was founded in 2020 at the University of Texas, by CEO Miles Murray, a Kerrville native and decorated Army veteran, and Matthew “Petey” Peterson. Murray shares how his inspiration for the company came from his experiences during military service, where he was often forced to choose between using fuel to dispose of waste or to power generators.

“Growing up in the Hill Country taught me lessons that I carried with me throughout my life,” said Murray. “During my time in the military, I was more shocked by the lack of investment in waste management and ecosystem preservation than by combat itself. ‘Don’t Mess with Texas’ is more than just a slogan—it’s a commitment to maintaining and restoring our natural resources without hindering human progress.”

Bringing in Toss It DumpstersIn addition to the partnership with Das GreenHaus, LOCOAL announced a collaboration with another local business Toss It Dumpsters, to co-locate at a shared headquarters facility that LOCOAL will be constructing in the Hill Country. The facility will serve as the operational hub for LOCOAL’s innovative waste-to-energy systems and a showcase for regional sustainability initiatives.

“Toss It is thrilled to welcome LOCOAL into the Hill Country,” said Walt McNeil, owner of Toss It. “Their state-of-the-art recycling system will transform construction wood waste and other materials into usable biochar while generating clean energy. By creating a circular solution for diverse waste streams—from cedar trees to construction lumber—we’re taking a bold step toward a more sustainable future.”

“LOCOAL and Toss It exemplify the power of our incubator program,” added McKenzie, who is proud to share the significance of Das GreenHaus connecting these two founders with one another. “It’s about the people behind the companies working together to make a real impact,” explains McKenzie.

The RAINMAKERLOCOAL’s flagship technology, RAINMAKER™, is a fully automated and intelligent biomass recycling system that extracts carbon and synthesized natural gas from organic materials, transforming waste into renewable resources. Supporting this technology is IMPCT.AI, a robust software platform providing critical measurement, reporting, and optimization capabilities to maximize system performance and track environmental benefits.

The new Hill Country headquarters will serve as a catalyst for LOCOAL’s growth, helping to scale its impact from a local initiative to a global solution for rising landfill costs and carbon emissions.

“The new HQ will be a major investment into the Texas Hill Country—we hope to catalyze a new era of people and companies to bring their ideas and solutions into a region that has a rich history and culture of innovation,” shares Murray.
