# Brett Vance, Host of Jet Jockeys, Raises Concerns Over COVID-19 Vaccine Injuries Among Flight Crews

Los Angeles, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Aug 12, 2024 @ 9:00 AM Pacific — Brett Vance, host of Jet Jockeys, a thrilling aviation show that delves into the world of flight through expert insights and exciting adventures, highlights growing concerns about COVID-19 vaccine injuries.

"As the literature on COVID-19 vaccine injuries becomes increasingly prevalent, alarming reports have emerged about the risks associated with these vaccines. One of the most commonly known injuries is myocarditis, a heart condition frequently linked to the 'Died Suddenly' phenomenon. Neurological problems are also on the rise," says Vance. According to the American College of Cardiology, the CDC has identified a potential association between mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and cases of myocarditis, particularly in young males aged 12-39.

"Recall that flight crews from almost all countries were required to take the COVID-19 shot or else forfeit their careers – the 'Jab or Job' policy. That one ended my career," Vance adds.

According to Airportia, an incident aboard American Airlines Flight 755 involved a First Officer experiencing a seizure on final approach, causing his body to become rigid and his legs to extend under the rudder pedals. Fortunately, the Captain assumed control, and the Relief Pilot and Purser removed the afflicted pilot, allowing the Relief Pilot to take over. "Sounds like a great outcome, right? Maybe even a one-off?" Vance questions.

However, Vance notes that such pilot incapacitation events—linked to COVID-19 shot injuries and illnesses—are becoming more common. "Imagine a scenario where the pilot flying has a seizure during critical phases of flight, such as takeoff or landing. If this occurs during takeoff, the pilot's leg might fully displace the rudder, causing the aircraft to depart the runway and potentially hit another aircraft or structure. During the final approach, as in the Flight 755 incident, the aircraft could roll out of control and crash," Vance explains.

"The good news is that treatment options are available for flight crews and others injured by company and government COVID-19 shot policies. Seek out those treatments and recover your health!" Vance concludes.

Brett Vance grew up in Odessa, Texas, and attended Permian High School, famous for "Friday Night Lights." Inspired by the flight operations at Webb Air Force Base, he chose the U.S. Air Force Academy for college.

After graduating, Brett began his military aviation career as a T-38 Instructor Pilot and flew the A-10 at RAF Bentwaters, England. After graduating from the USAF Test Pilot School, he transitioned to flight testing, joining the F-16 Test Squadron at Edwards Air Force Base.

Brett's career included roles at the Pentagon, as Deputy Commandant of the Test Pilot School, and as Commander of the 514th Flight Test Squadron at Hill Air Force Base. After retiring, he flew for Delta Air Lines and later joined the FAA as a test pilot, instructor, and evaluator.

Brett Vance has significantly contributed to aviation safety and innovation in the military and civilian sectors.
