# Innovative Treatment Option for Depression: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)

Lancaster, PA (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Feb 16, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Eastern — New Direction Functional Psychiatry, located in Lancaster, PA, is a leading provider of innovative mental health treatments. Under the leadership of Dr. John Smith, the team offers a comprehensive approach to mental health, including options like Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) for individuals seeking alternative treatment for depression.

The clinic is proud to provide Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), an innovative treatment for depression that has shown promising results for individuals who have not found success with other treatment options. TMS utilizes magnetic fields to create changes in nerve cells within the brain, activating regions associated with mood control.

Before undergoing TMS treatment, a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation is recommended to determine the best course of treatment for specific mental health needs. Talk therapy and medication may also be considered, with pharmacogenomic testing helping to predict the effectiveness of different medications.

TMS treatment sessions typically last less than 30 minutes, using the safe and anesthesia-free BrainsWay® Deep TMS™ platform. While some discomfort in the scalp area may occur during TMS pulses, there is no recovery time necessary, allowing patients to resume their daily activities without interruption.

Individuals seeking TMS treatment can conveniently schedule appointments online or by phone through New Direction Functional Psychiatry in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
