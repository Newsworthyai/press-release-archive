Boerne, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Sep 18, 2024 @ 7:00 AM US/Central — The Building Texas Show, hosted by Justin McKenzie, continues to spotlight innovative entrepreneurs shaping the Texas business landscape. In the latest episode, McKenzie sits down with Lillian Oler, founder of Assemble Cocktail, to explore her entrepreneurial journey from launching a unique cocktail experience in a cozy cottage to expanding her brand with a franchising model.

With its beginnings in a quaint downtown Bernie location, Assemble Cocktail offered a one-of-a-kind mixology workshop that catered to social gatherings and corporate events. “It was less about the cocktail and more about bringing people together,” says Oler, reflecting on her original vision.

In this engaging episode, listeners will hear about Oler’s strategic pivot to a mobile format and her current plans for a new brick-and-mortar space in San Antonio. “If it can be done in Bernie, Texas, it can be done anywhere,” Oler confidently states, emphasizing the scalability of her business. Now, she is poised to introduce her franchise model to aspiring entrepreneurs seeking a turnkey opportunity to bring the Assemble Cocktail experience to their communities.

McKenzie praises Oler’s meticulous approach, highlighting how her hospitality background and hands-on experience have enabled her to create an immersive social environment. The interview delves into the intricacies of starting a business, the importance of adapting to market demands, and Oler's innovative approach to franchising that makes it accessible, flexible, and fun.

The episode offers an insightful conversation about entrepreneurship, from the grind of launching during a pandemic to the joys and challenges of building a successful brand.
