# Psychedelics Offer New Hope for Patients with Severe Depression, Says Gut Feelings Clinic

Berkeley, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Jan 25, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Australia/Perth â€” Gut Feelings Psychiatry, a leading provider of functional medicine and psychiatry services, is excited to announce the inclusion of psychedelics in its range of treatment options. With a focus on helping patients with severe or treatment-resistant depression, Gut Feelings Psychiatry aims to provide rapid relief through the use of ketamine.

Ketamine, available in various forms such as intramuscular, intravenous, and intranasal, has shown promising results in relieving depression symptoms. While the uses of ketamine for this purpose are considered off-label, Gut Feelings Psychiatry is an approved Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) site for intranasal esketamine, a variation of ketamine known as Spravato, which has received FDA approval and may be covered by insurance.

Gut Feelings Psychiatry believes that by expanding their treatment options to include psychedelics, they can provide a holistic approach to mental health and wellness.

In addition to providing psychedelic treatments, Gut Feelings Psychiatry offers other clinical services such as medication management, weight loss programs, and specialized attention to chronic gut health issues. They also provide services in the business realm, including startup advising and public speaking engagements.

Patients interested in exploring the potential benefits of psychedelics and other services offered by Gut Feelings Psychiatry can find more information at www.mygutfeelings.com. The clinic serves patients virtually in CA, NY, TX, FL, CO, IL, NC, and PA, and offers in-person consultations in Oakland, Berkeley, San Francisco, and Walnut Creek.
