# Synchrony Brain Health Introduces Breakthrough Treatment Option: dTMS Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

Evanston, IL (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Jan 25, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Australia/Perth â€” Synchrony Brain Health, a leader in innovative mental health solutions, is proud to announce the introduction of a groundbreaking treatment known as deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (dTMS). This non-invasive therapy holds promise in assisting individuals diagnosed with a wide range of mental health and cognitive issues.

Based on the understanding that brain activity plays a crucial role in mental health, dTMS is revolutionizing the treatment landscape. With its ability to precisely target specific brain areas using magnetic fields, this therapy offers hope to those who have not responded well to traditional treatments.

The potential applications of deep TMS therapy are vast, with clinical evidence demonstrating its efficacy in diverse conditions. Patients diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder, depression, and even long COVID brain fog may find relief through this treatment modality. Furthermore, deep TMS shows promise in offering support to individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and conditions associated with chronic pain such as fibromyalgia and multiple sclerosis (MS).

With its non-invasive nature and minimal side effects, deep TMS therapy is emerging as a vital alternative to medications and other traditional treatment methods. By precisely targeting brain regions, it can restore ongoing neural dysfunctions and help individuals regain control over their mental health.
