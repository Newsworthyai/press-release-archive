# HR.com Announces 2025 Future of Learning Technologies Advisory Board to Lead Groundbreaking Research and Virtual Event

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Sep 3, 2024 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — HR.com, the largest network of human resources (HR) executives, has announced the Future of Learning Technologies Advisory Board 2025. This distinguished panel of industry experts will collaborate with HR.com’s HR Research Institute (HRRI) to provide comprehensive insights and practical strategies for leveraging learning and development (L&D) technologies in areas such as employee upskilling, reskilling, career advancement, and soft skills development.

Their combined expertise will offer crucial insights for upcoming research and a virtual event focused on uncovering trends and best practices in the technologies, tools, and solutions organizations use to train and educate employees. While this includes learning management systems (LMS), learning content management systems (LCMS), and learning experience platforms (LXPs), today’s learning technologies extend far beyond. We’ll also explore how L&D technologies, solutions, architectures, and paradigms are expected to evolve in the near future.

The research findings from this initiative will be published in a comprehensive report offering detailed insights and recommendations. Additionally, a condensed two-page infographic will provide a quick reference for key points. The upcoming virtual event will include a day of informative sessions from a variety of subject matter experts in this area.
