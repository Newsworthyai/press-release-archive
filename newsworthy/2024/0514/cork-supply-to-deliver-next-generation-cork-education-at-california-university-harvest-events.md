# Cork Supply to Deliver Next-Generation Cork Education at California University Harvest Events

Benicia, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday May 14, 2024 @ 6:05 AM Pacific — Cork Supply is continuing to deliver value to the U.S. wine industry, bringing the cork harvest to California universities this month. The noted packaging closure supplier will bring together education and wine industry stakeholders, media and students for conversation, celebration and learning at live events, which will be open to the public. Looking ahead, Cork Supply will build on the demonstrations by sending three scholarship students from U.S. agriculture-focused universities to experience the cork harvest in Portugal in June.

Events at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo (May 28) and the University of California, Davis (May 30) center on harvesting mature cork oaks on the schools’ campuses. With cork oaks only eligible for harvest approximately every nine years, the demonstrations are truly rare events: the last cork harvest at UC Davis took place at least 30 years ago, per campus representatives. Focused on student engagement and education, events will complement classroom education and emphasize cork closures’ sustainability and beneficial uses for the wine industry.

A raw material that is versatile, regenerative and biodegradable, cork is particularly relevant today in light of the climate crisis and growing awareness for the importance of leveraging renewable resources in products across industries:

Cork Oak Facts

* The cork oak is the only tree whose bark regenerates itself after harvesting, leaving trees intact for future harvests and carbon sequestration.
* Living up to 200 years and harvested every nine years following maturity, cork oaks are impressive CO2 repositories, drawing down greenhouse gas emissions throughout their lives.
* Following harvest, a cork tree accelerates its absorption of CO2 to regrow its bark, storing up to five times more CO2.(1)

Cork oak forests—known as the Montado in Portuguese—are an example of a nature-based climate solution, defined by the World Wildlife Federation as an ecosystem that captures and sequesters carbon from the atmosphere, and does double duty by providing vital habitat for wildlife. Cork oak forests are home to hundreds of animal and plant species, many of them endangered and globally retain up to 14 million tons of CO2 annually. (2)

This impressive volume of absorption from cork forests annually is equivalent to the emissions from 35,805,945,507 miles driven by an average gasoline-powered passenger vehicle, 15,429,072,890 pounds of coal burned, or 1,825,735 homes' energy use for one year (3). Given that a significant share of wine’s carbon footprint generally derives from packaging and distribution(4), utilizing cork closures can drive down packaged wine’s overall carbon footprint since closures are carbon-negative.

Cork Supply is a leading provider of innovative and best-in-class cork closures. The company’s latest product introduction is Legacy, a game-changing innovation that is the only natural cork closure on the market guaranteed to be consistent in oxygen transmission rate (OTR).
