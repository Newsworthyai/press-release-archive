In Houston, the laws governing the consumption of hemp, CBD, and cannabis products are designed to ensure safety and compliance with both state and federal guidelines. The possession and use of these products are regulated under the Texas Compassionate Use Act and the Texas Hemp Program. These regulations stipulate that all hemp-derived products must contain less than 0.3% THC. Businesses are required to comply with rigorous testing and labeling requirements to guarantee product safety and consumer knowledge.

Consumers are advised to purchase these products from reputable sources like certified smoke shops to ensure they adhere to state regulations. Public consumption of cannabis products remains restricted, and it is essential for consumers to be aware of and respect these boundaries.
