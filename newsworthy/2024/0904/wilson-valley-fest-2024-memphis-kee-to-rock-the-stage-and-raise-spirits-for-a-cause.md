# Wilson Valley Fest 2024: Memphis Kee to Rock the Stage and Raise Spirits for a Cause

Bell County, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Sep 4, 2024 @ 1:00 PM Central — The countdown is on! Wilson Valley Fest 2024 is about to make history, bringing music, whiskey, and community together in a powerful way. On October 26, 2024, Wilson Valley Mercantile will host its first-ever Valley Fest, a day-long celebration with one goal: to raise funds for Panhandle Proud, a charity making a real difference for wildfire victims in the Texas Panhandle.

Since its start, Panhandle Proud, formed by the Texas Distilled Spirits Association (TDSA) and Texas Whiskey Association (TXWA), has raised over $100,000 through events at distilleries across Texas. Now, with Valley Fest, we’re aiming even higher.

Memphis Kee Takes the Spotlight

Memphis Kee will headline Wilson Valley Fest 2024. Memphis Kee’s music isn’t just heard—it’s felt. His energy and passion will light up the Wilson Valley stage, creating an experience that no one will want to miss.

From soulful singer/songwriter rounds to full bands that will have everyone on their feet, Valley Fest is about celebrating music that moves us. And with Memphis Kee leading the way, it’s going to be a day to remember.

Whiskey, Straight from the Heart of Texas

Wilson Valley Mercantile takes pride in every drop of whiskey they create. As Bell County’s first legal distillery, Wilson Valley Mercantile crafts whiskey from seed to sip, ensuring that every bottle reflects the true spirit of Texas. Festival-goers will get to taste these whiskeys, from bold bourbons to smooth ryes, each one telling a story of the land and the hands that made it.

A Festival with a Purpose

“This festival is about bringing people together—for the music, the whiskey, and most importantly, for the cause,” says John Evans, Farmer and Owner of Wilson Valley Mercantile. “Panhandle Proud is doing incredible work, and we’re proud to support them with Valley Fest.”

The festival kicks off at 11 AM and wraps up at 10 PM, with every moment packed with music, fun, and community spirit. Tickets are on sale soon, and all net proceeds will go directly to Panhandle Proud.
