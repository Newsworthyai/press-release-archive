Toronto, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Nov 27, 2024 @ 11:00 AM America/Toronto — inocta.io is excited to announce the launch of Diina.app (Digital Intuitive Insight Network Based on AI), the first AI-driven platform designed to measure a city's mood index using a proprietary algorithm. This unique platform allows users to intuitively connect with the vibes of six major cities—without the need for any login. This approach not only preserves user privacy but also enhances the element of surprise and discovery, allowing users to stumble upon content they might not have actively sought out, making exploration more engaging and serendipitous.

The platform captures the unique vibes, moods, and rhythms of six key cities, enriching the discovery of content and places in a novel and engaging way.

Diina.app offers snapshots of city moods, helping users explore content without the influence of algorithmic tracking or social bias. By emphasizing discovery, Diina.app encourages users to encounter unexpected experiences, broadening their perspectives and making urban exploration a delightful journey of surprise. It fosters an authentic exploration of urban atmospheres by answering five key questions, each designed to connect users with the essence of the city in a fresh and meaningful way:

2. What’s buzzing in the city? – The City Buzz, providing a quick look at what’s happening locally and in the news.

3. What should we eat? – Restaurant suggestions and random mood-based recipe ideas, tailored to match the emotional tone of the day.

4. What’s good to watch? – Movies and TV show recommendations based on the city's mood, giving users an entertainment experience that resonates with the current vibe.

5. Where should we go out? – The City Events feature highlights the best spots and happenings around the city, perfect for those who want to step out and experience the local energy.
