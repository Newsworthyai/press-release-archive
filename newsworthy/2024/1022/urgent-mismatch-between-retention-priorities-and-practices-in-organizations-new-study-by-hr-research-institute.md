# Urgent Mismatch Between Retention Priorities and Practices in Organizations - New Study by HR Research Institute

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Oct 22, 2024 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — The HR Research Institute’s new study reveals a critical disconnect between retention priorities and execution. While retention is universally recognized as vital, few organizations are effectively keeping their workforce engaged and satisfied.

According to the findings, 56% of top leadership identify employee retention as one of their top three priorities—or even the top priority. This sentiment is echoed by line managers, senior leaders, and HR professionals alike. However, just 23% of organizations rate their retention strategies as "top-notch" or “advanced,” revealing a significant gap between intention and execution.

The study identifies several key factors that are undermining retention efforts in organizations:

* Lack of well-defined career paths (60%)
* Work overload (56%)
* Lack of skilled managers (51%)

A significant portion of turnover is being driven by HR-related issues, including the lack of proper training for managers (64%) and a poor overall employee experience (50%). This points to the need for stronger leadership development and a more employee-centered approach to work culture.

One of the study’s most promising insights is how artificial intelligence (AI) can be leveraged to improve retention rates. AI’s potential lies in its ability to identify skill gaps quickly and recommend personalized learning paths, helping organizations retain talent by improving both career development and training programs.

* Identifying skills gaps and recommending targeted training (49%)
* Personalizing and enhancing learning and development (40%)

"These findings are a wake-up call for leaders," stated Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator and CEO of HR.com. “To boost long-term retention, companies must focus on developing career paths, improving management training and technology, and enhancing the employee experience, especially as competition for top talent grows.”

The full research report, HR.com's State of Employee Retention 2024-25, is available for free download and offers a detailed look at retention challenges and recommendations for business leaders looking to improve their retention outcomes in the near future.

The recording of the research webcast presentation, Reducing the Brutal Costs of Unwanted Employee Turnover, is available for viewing 24/7 on demand.
