# Announcing: Ricki Lake & Bake by Stone Road Farms

Los Angeles, California (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Dec 2, 2024 @ 7:00 AM US/Pacific — Actor, Emmy-winning talk show host, and acclaimed documentarian Ricki Lake has teamed up with leading California-based cannabis brand Stone Road Farms to launch a limited edition product, Ricki Lake & Bake.

Ricki Lake & Bake is a 1/2 oz Preground Roll-Your-Own Pouch made from Stone Road Farms’ signature infused solventless bubble hash. Like all of Stone Road’s flower, it is sungrown on their 57-acre biodynamic farm in Nevada City, CA and made from the best buds (never shake, filler or distillate-sprayed weed). Each Ricki Lake & Bake pouch is enhanced with bubble hash, made without the use of chemical solvents, and infused for purity, potency and a flavorful full-spectrum cannabinoid and terpene profile. The pouches are sold in Stone Road’s beautifully designed, 99% plastic-free packaging and sealed with a custom sticker that features Ricki, making it a collector’s item.

A longtime proponent of cannabis and fan of Stone Road Farms, Ricki Lake knew exactly where to go when choosing a cannabis partner. “I obviously believe in this medicine, and in Stone Road’s brand and what they’ve built,” Lake says. “It is so aligned with where I am in my life, and I'm so happy to be bringing this out.”

Designed to reflect Ricki’s personal affinity for cannabis, this collectible is more than just a product; “it’s a tribute to her iconic career and long-standing cannabis advocacy,” says Stone Road Farms’ Founder & CEO Lex Corwin. Corwin had the idea for the collab after visiting Lake at her house in Malibu and discovering that she consumes cannabis daily and even enjoys growing her own.

Lake has been public about her cannabis use since 2018 when she spearheaded, financed, and produced Weed The People, a powerful documentary that highlights the healing power of cannabis for children with cancer. The film has inspired millions of viewers to think differently about using cannabis as medicine, helping to remove societal stigmas. With a similar mission, she currently hosts the podcast The High Life with Ricki Lake, which explores "the best phase of her life" — midlife— covering personal growth, mental wellness, and, of course, weed.

“It's funny, when I did The Ricki Lake Show from my 20s to mid-30s, I was very much a disciple of Nancy Reagan,” says Lake. “I was very judgmental and close-minded: ‘Just Say No.’ I was indoctrinated and very fear-filled. It wasn't until I married my second husband, my now sadly deceased husband, who turned me on to the idea that cannabis is a medicine. Now I live in Malibu and I started my own grow a few years ago. I think this is my third or fourth season we just harvested and I'm making the most beautiful medicine that I’ve come to love recreationally. My new beautiful husband Ross and I, our favorite thing to do is get high at night and giggle, have great conversations, get great sleep. I mean, I'm a believer that cannabis can really help just about anything.”Ricki Lake & Bake is available now in dispensaries across California.
