# Introducing: Anytime Low Dose THC Seltzers with 0 Calories and 0 Sugar

Washington, DC (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Dec 17, 2024 @ 6:00 AM Pacific — Introducing Anytime, a debut collection of all natural, low-dose THC & CBD seltzers that offer a deliciously bubbly experience fit for any occasion. Anytime Seltzers were created as the perfect balance of THC and CBD, without sugar or calories, for a guilt-free buzz and no hangover.

Each can of Anytime is perfectly balanced with a microdose of 5mg of hemp-derived THC, 15mg of CBD and a hint of natural flavor — this winning formula won both regional and national awards in a recent blind-taste test by an esteemed panel of industry experts at America's Best Spirits beverage competition.

Award Winning Flavors

In its first year of business, Anytime Seltzer emerged as a rising star in the THC / Hemp Category at the second annual America’s Best Spirits beverage competition. Three of four Anytime flavors were recognized in both regional and national rounds, totaling seven awards, including the prized accolade for Best in State.

Notably, Anytime stood out in the robust South region, which had the most entries in this category than any other region. Strawberry Kiwi was a standout flavor winning Silver in Southern Region, Bronze Nationally, and the Best in State winner. Raspberry Lemonade and Lime both won Bronze regionally and nationally.

The accolades come as recognition of Anytime Seltzer’s dedication to not only offering a healthier alternative to traditional alcoholic drinks but also achieving great taste—a particularly challenging feat in the hemp-infused beverage category.

* Anytime Strawberry Kiwi — A vibrant flavor with the perfect balance of sweet strawberries and tangy kiwi. Anytime Strawberry Kiwi was awarded Best in State and Silver in the Regional (South) category. The flavor also took home Bronze for the National Award.

* Anytime Raspberry Lemonade — This bold and juicy flavor offers a delightful blend of vibrant raspberries and zesty but sweet lemonade. Anytime Raspberry Lemonade awarded Bronze for the Regional Award (South) and Bronze in the National Category.

* Anytime Lime — A bright and citrusy flavor creates a refreshingly crisp experience with every sip. Anytime Lime received Bronze in the Regional (South) category and won Bronze nationally.

* Anytime Mango — With a delicate hint of tropical sweetness, Mango is simple but satisfying. Sip a refreshingly crisp-tasting seltzer to help you find your chill without the hangover the next day.

About Anytime’s Balanced Buzz

One Anytime is similar to 1 double IPA or 1 large glass of wine. Unlike cannabis edibles, Anytime’s effects come on within 15 minutes and wear off after 90 minutes. This allows the consumer to control and build the experience they desire.

Momentum Builds for Anytime Seltzer’s Expansion

These awards come on the heels of the brand's recent expansion into all 15 Total Wine & More stores in North Carolina. Built from the ground up without any investors, Anytime Seltzer is rapidly establishing itself in the Southeast, showcasing its ability to thrive in the competitive hemp beverage space.

“We’re incredibly proud of the product we've built as a bootstrapped operation. Winning awards for three of our four flavors in our very first year is both humbling and exhilarating, especially in a category filled with so many outstanding brands. There is so much potential in hemp beverages, and we're so excited to see how this category continues to evolve.”  — Kaitlin Murphy, Co-owner & CMO of Anytime Seltzer

About America’s Best Spirits Competition

Launched in 2023, America's Best Spirits Competition is a prestigious national event that celebrates exceptional craft spirits from across the United States. The competition is structured as a "Triple Crown" format, allowing brands to enter and be evaluated at the state, regional, and national levels.

The regional competitions are divided into five distinct geographic areas - the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Southwest, and West. This unique structure provides brands the opportunity to first showcase their quality and craftsmanship against their peers within their home region, before advancing to the national round to compete against the best spirits from across the country.

The competition also features a dedicated Hemp/THC category, recognizing the growing influence and popularity of hemp-infused and cannabis-derived spirits and beverages.

Judging for America's Best Spirits is conducted by an esteemed panel of industry experts, including master distillers, mixologists, and spirits journalists. Entries are evaluated on a range of criteria such as aroma, flavor profile, mouthfeel, and overall balance and drinkability. The competition’s judging process was designed to ensure fairness and precision, as each submission is evaluated blind, without any identifying details, to maintain objectivity. Drinks are judged individually on their merits rather than in comparison to others, with only the highest-scoring entries earning recognition. Medals are awarded at the gold, silver, and bronze levels for both regional and national competitions.

Now in its second year, America's Best Spirits Competition has quickly established itself as one of the premier showcases for the dynamically growing craft spirits industry in the United States. The competition's multi-tiered structure and rigorous judging process make the awards highly coveted within the spirits community.
