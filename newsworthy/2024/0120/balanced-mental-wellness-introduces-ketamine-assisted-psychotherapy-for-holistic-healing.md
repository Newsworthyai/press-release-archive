# Balanced Mental Wellness Introduces Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy for Holistic Healing

Denver, CO (Newsworthy.ai) Saturday Jan 20, 2024 @ 12:00 PM Eastern â€” Balanced Mental Wellness, a leading mental health facility in Denver, is proud to offer Ketamine Assisted Psychotherapy (KAP) as an effective treatment option for individuals struggling with conditions such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, and addictions.

Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, has shown remarkable potential in enhancing neuroplasticity and regenerating synaptic connections between brain cells. By working on the neurotransmitter called Glutamate, Ketamine can induce rapid antidepressant effects within just 24 hours, with its benefits lasting for weeks to months when administered in repeated doses. However, the integration of ketamine with therapy is the key to achieving longer-lasting positive outcomes.

During a 2-hour session at Balanced Mental Wellness, ketamine is administered either via intramuscular injection or in the form of lozenges, facilitating emotional access and openings for exploration. However, the process doesn't begin without an initial free 15-minute consultation. This consultation enables individuals to gather information about the treatment while determining if it aligns with their needs.

Integrating indigenous practices with psychedelic medicines, Balanced Mental Wellness firmly believes in the inherent wholeness of every individual. By combining ketamine therapy with integration therapy before and after each session, they aim to assist individuals in reconnecting with themselves, healing emotional wounds, and staying connected to their authentic selves.
