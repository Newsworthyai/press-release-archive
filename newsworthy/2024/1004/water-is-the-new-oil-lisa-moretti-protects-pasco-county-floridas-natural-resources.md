# Water Is the New Oil: Lisa Moretti Protects Pasco County, Florida’s Natural Resources

Pasco County, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Oct 4, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Eastern — Lisa Moretti, candidate for Pasco County Commissioner District 1, is making awareness of water a top priority in her campaign, warning that Pasco County’s natural water resources are at risk of depletion due to unchecked development and irresponsible practices. Moretti is calling for immediate action to protect the county’s vital water supply and preserve it for future generations.

"Water is the most precious resource we have, and it’s being threatened by overdevelopment and short-sighted policies," Moretti said. "Our wells are being over-pumped, our springs are drying up, and developers are eyeing our East Pasco well fields as the next water source to exploit. This cannot continue."

Moretti has expressed concerns about the long-term consequences of over-pumping, which could lead to severe environmental damage, including sinkholes, saltwater intrusion, and the loss of natural habitats. Pasco County is already seeing signs of stress on its water system, with local springs in decline and water tables dropping.

"We are at a tipping point," Moretti said. "If we continue down this path, Pasco County could face a water crisis that will devastate our environment, harm local agriculture, and drive up costs for everyone. We must take action now to protect our water supply before it’s too late."

Moretti is particularly critical of plans to turn to "toilet-to-tap" technology, which involves treating wastewater for reuse in drinking water systems. She argues that Pasco County should focus on water conservation and sustainable growth, rather than resorting to extreme measures to keep up with the demand caused by overdevelopment.

"Toilet-to-tap is not a solution I support," Moretti said. "We need to focus on responsible water management practices, protect our natural recharge areas, and slow down the unsustainable growth that is depleting our resources."

Moretti’s plan to safeguard Pasco County’s water supply includes:

- Limiting Overdevelopment: Reducing the strain on the county’s water resources by slowing the pace of growth and ensuring that any new development includes strong water conservation measures.

- Protecting Recharge Areas: Preserving Pasco’s natural recharge areas to ensure that the water table remains stable and that fresh water can continue to flow into the aquifer.

- Reducing Pollution: Implementing stricter regulations to prevent untreated runoff from entering local waterways, particularly in areas prone to flooding and water contamination.

- Sustainable Water Practices: Encouraging residents and businesses to adopt sustainable water practices, such as using native landscaping and rainwater harvesting.

"Water is the new oil in terms of its value and scarcity, and we have to treat it as such," Moretti said. "We can’t afford to waste it or allow developers to drain our resources for short-term gain and amenities. My focus as commissioner will be to protect our water supply and ensure that Pasco County remains a healthy, vibrant place to live."

Moretti notes that the first recorded treaty in history was made over water, it truly is a precious resource. She is calling on residents to join her in demanding a new “treaty” with stronger protections for Pasco County’s natural resources. She believes that with responsible planning and leadership, the county can manage its growth without sacrificing its environment.

"Pasco County’s future depends on how we manage our natural resources today," Moretti said. "We have to make tough choices now to ensure that our children and grandchildren can enjoy the clean water and natural beauty that makes this county special."
