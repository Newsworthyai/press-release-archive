# The Inland Marine Underwriters Association (IMUA) Sets 2024 Annual Meeting Agenda

New York, NY (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Mar 14, 2024 @ 11:00 AM Eastern — The Inland Marine Underwriters Association (IMUA) announces its 93rd Annual Meeting & Educational Symposium agenda. The IMUA 2024 Annual Meeting will be held at the La Cantera Resort & Spa, San Antonio, TX, from April 30 - May 1, 2024.

In announcing its Annual Meeting, IMUA President and CEO Kevin O'Brien said, "The annual meeting theme, Unlocking Opportunities, reflects the many opportunities association members have to assist them personally and professionally within our ever-changing business environment. This year's annual meeting will kick off with a unique session and an executive panel featuring an industry view from three perspectives – a broker, an underwriter, and a reinsurer. Their discussion on issues facing the inland marine industry should set the stage for what we expect to be among one of the most memorable meetings to date."

O'Brien noted, "This year's meeting offers diverse topics extremely relevant to today's inland marine environment. Our Education Committee has done an outstanding job in selecting an agenda focusing on pressing issues we face as an industry and securing knowledgeable professionals to address each."

The topics for the IMUA 93rd Annual Meeting include:

* Executive Panel – Broker, Underwriter, Reinsurer
* Recent Court Rulings on Builders Risk Insurance Claims
* Transportation: Fictitious Pickup & Double Brokered Loads
* Convective Storms & Climate Change
* Modular Construction: Manufacturing, Transit and Installation

Mr. O'Brien pointed out that IMUA offers "Parallel Track" programming for newer, less experienced inland marine underwriting and claims personnel.

"These sessions are among the most well-received programs because they focus on those new or less experienced in commercial inland marine insurance. We are pleased to include it again as part of our overall professional development agenda," Mr. O'Brien said.

All those attending the 'Parallel Track' will also have access to our Modular Construction: Manufacturing, Transit, and Installation session and the keynote address.

The Parallel Track subjects to be covered are:

* Introduction to Inland Marine
* The Basics of Builders Risk
* Understanding Contractors Equipment
* Transportation Insurance

IMUA Chairperson Tony Falcone, Region President at Intact Insurance, commented, "I am extremely proud to serve another term as IMUA's Board Chair. We have accomplished a significant amount over the past year in the execution of our strategic plan and I'm looking forward to even more progress in 2024. Our end goal, of course, is to enrich and enhance the member experience. Part of our commitment to our membership is the acclaimed Annual Meeting, an event that is one of a kind in our niche. Thank you to our Education Committee and IMUA staff for creating another outstanding program."
