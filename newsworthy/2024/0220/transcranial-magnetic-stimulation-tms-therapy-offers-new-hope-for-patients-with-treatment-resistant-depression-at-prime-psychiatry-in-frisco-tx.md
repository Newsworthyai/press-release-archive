# Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Therapy Offers New Hope for Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression at Prime Psychiatry in Frisco TX

Frisco, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Feb 20, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Eastern â€” Prime Psychiatry, a leading mental health clinic in Frisco, TX, is now offering Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Therapy as a groundbreaking treatment option for individuals struggling with treatment-resistant depression. TMS Therapy is a non-invasive and non-systemic procedure that utilizes magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain, providing a remarkable alternative for patients who have not responded well to previous antidepressant treatments.

Depression can be a debilitating condition, and for those who haven't found relief through traditional treatments, TMS Therapy provides a ray of hope. By precisely targeting specific areas of the brain using magnetic fields, we can stimulate nerve cells and improve the symptoms of depression.

Unlike other treatment options, TMS Therapy can be safely performed in a psychiatrist's office without the need for surgery, anesthesia, or sedation. A typical course of TMS treatment consists of 36 sessions done five days a week over six to nine weeks, with each session lasting for 19 minutes. Patients can easily continue their daily routines before and after each session, making TMS Therapy a convenient and hassle-free option.

At Prime Psychiatry, patients have access to an array of mental health services beyond TMS Therapy. The clinic offers Spravato treatments, medication management, counseling services, substance abuse treatment, and specialized care for child and adolescent mental health.

Prime Psychiatry has two convenient office locations in Frisco and Plano, Texas, and their friendly staff is available during office hours to assist with scheduling and inquiries.
