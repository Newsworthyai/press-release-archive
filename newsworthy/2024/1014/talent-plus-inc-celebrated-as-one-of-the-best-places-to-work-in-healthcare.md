# Talent Plus, Inc. Celebrated as One of the Best Places to Work in Healthcare

Lincoln, Nebraska (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Oct 14, 2024 @ 6:00 AM Pacific — Talent Plus, Inc., a leading global consulting firm headquartered in Lincoln, was celebrated on Thursday night in Nashville, TN, by Modern Healthcare’s annual recognition as one of the 2024 Best Places to Work in Healthcare, ranking 68th. As well, Talent Plus ranked 5th among the 150 ranked winners overall in having a Healthy Workplace (across all healthcare providers and vendors).

“While being on this list 7 times is simply extraordinary being a Best Place to Work is a journey. We listen, refine and grow in our culture and what colleagues feel is rewarding. Many of our practices (e.g. honor vacation policy, investment solutions, increased transparency, etc.) represent listening to surveys like this annual recognition. We’re committed to Talent Plus being a diverse, equitable, inclusive, belonging, caring, and respectful workplace. Our aspiration is that our benefits empower colleagues to be self-directed in their work-life balance and well-being – allowing them to bring their best self to work, into the community, and back home each day,” offers Talent Plus President Makenzie Rath,

According to Mary Ellen Podmolik, Editor-in-Chief, Modern Healthcare, "There’s a lot of listening going on inside healthcare’s top workplaces and that of their vendors. These employers know for all the promising talk of technical innovation and artificial intelligence, the heart is its people. That message must start at the top, then make its way throughout the ranks. Pay matters, but today’s employees want more than just dollars. They want a feeling of belonging, a career path, and for their bosses to help them balance their professional and personal lives.”

Modern Healthcare’s award program identifies and recognizes outstanding employers in the healthcare industry nationwide.
