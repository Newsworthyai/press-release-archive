# Revolutionizing Relief: Conventions Psychiatry & Counseling Partners with Apollo and NeuroStar TMS

Warrenville, IL (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Jan 26, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Eastern â€” Conventions Psychiatry & Counseling is delighted to announce its partnership with Apollo and NeuroStar TMS, introducing an innovative treatment option for individuals grappling with depression. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) therapy, a non-invasive procedure, has demonstrated safety and efficacy, providing long-term remission in patients with treatment-resistant depression.

TMS therapy employs a magnet to stimulate specific nerve cells within the brain responsible for mood control. By targeting these areas, the treatment positively influences neurotransmitter levels, resulting in a reduction in depressive symptoms. Unlike traditional treatments, TMS doesn't involve surgery or medication adjustments, presenting a risk-free alternative for patients.

At Conventions Psychiatry & Counseling, a TMS session ranges from 19 to 37 minutes, designed to be non-disruptive with no impact on alertness or memory. Patients can independently drive to and from sessions. Typically, treatment occurs five days a week for 4-6 weeks, optimizing the potential for successful outcomes.

Covered by most insurances, Conventions TMS Therapy offers an accessible solution for individuals seeking relief from treatment-resistant depression. The therapy provides an evidence-based alternative to medications, instilling new hope for those who haven't found success with traditional treatments.

In collaboration with Apollo and NeuroStar TMS, Conventions Psychiatry & Counseling is dedicated to transforming the lives of individuals suffering from treatment-resistant depression through effective and non-invasive TMS therapy.
