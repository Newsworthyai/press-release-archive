# TMS NW Introduces Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Depression and OCD Treatment

Vancouver, WA (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Feb 19, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Eastern â€” TMS NW, a leading provider of innovative mental health solutions, is pleased to announce the availability of Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) for the treatment of depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This non-invasive therapy stimulates the brain region responsible for symptoms, resulting in significant improvement.

TMS involves the use of a small coil placed over the patient's head, which delivers electrical stimulation to the brain through a rapidly alternating current. This creates a magnetic field that passes through the brain, promoting positive changes in neuronal activity.

TMS NW provides Deep TMS treatment specifically for adult patients with Major Depressive Disorder and OCD who have not experienced satisfactory improvement from previous antidepressant or anti-anxiety medications. However, it is important to note that TMS is contraindicated if the patient has metal implants in or around their head, such as cochlear implants, pacemakers, or certain aneurysm clips or coils.

In addition to depression and OCD, TMS is also FDA-cleared for the treatment of anxiety and smoking cessation. However, its use for other indications such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, migraines, and ADHD is considered investigational.

With its shorter 20-minute treatment sessions, Deep TMS provides more efficient outcomes compared to traditional TMS, which requires 37-minute sessions. The therapy typically spans 4-6 weeks with daily sessions, allowing patients to resume their daily routine afterward.
