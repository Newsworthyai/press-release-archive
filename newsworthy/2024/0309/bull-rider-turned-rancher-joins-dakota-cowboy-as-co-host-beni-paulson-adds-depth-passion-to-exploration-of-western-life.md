# Bull Rider Turned Rancher Joins Dakota Cowboy as Co-Host Beni Paulson Adds Depth & Passion to Exploration of Western Life

Bismarck, ND (Newsworthy.ai) Saturday Mar 9, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Central — BEK TV’s Dakota Cowboy, the beloved television program that tells the stories of western living, is thrilled to announce the addition of Beni Paulson as co-host. Beni, a former professional bull rider and esteemed ranch owner from North Dakota, joins current host Tisa Peek. Together, the duo brings a unique perspective and passion for rural living.

Beni will make his debut alongside Tisa this Sunday, March 10. Viewers can tune in each Sunday at 7pm CT on the BEK TV channel, online at BEK.News, or on the BEK TV+ streaming app.

Growing up in western North Dakota, Beni Paulson's childhood dream was to become a bull rider. From his early days riding sheep and calves to ultimately mastering bulls, Beni's journey in the rodeo world was one of dedication and grit, characteristics that transitioned him well into the ranching industry.

Beni and his family now dedicate their lives to their ranch, where they raise bucking bulls and beef cattle. “Many people don’t realize the dedication and stewardship that farmers and ranchers pour into their work,” says Beni regarding the lack of knowledge about the food industry. “I’ve always desired to manage the land and play a role in feeding the world. It’s something I take very seriously.”

“What sets Beni apart is his unwavering connection to his roots, despite his extensive travels with bull riding,” says Tisa Peek, current host of Dakota Cowboy. “We both have a deep-rooted passion for the western way of life, and I’m eager for him to bring his wealth of experience from the rodeo arena, his love for the land, and his insights into the agriculture industry to our viewers.”

“I’m excited to introduce viewers to the people in agriculture, learn from their experiences, and showcase their stories,” says Beni. “There are very few things that we all need, and food is one of them. My hope is that I can help others understand the important role farmers and ranchers play and the challenges they face.”
