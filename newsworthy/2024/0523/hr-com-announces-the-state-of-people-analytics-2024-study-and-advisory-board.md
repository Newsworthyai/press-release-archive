# HR.com Announces The State of People Analytics 2024 Study and Advisory Board

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday May 23, 2024 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — HR.com, the largest network of human resources (HR) executives, has announced HR.com’s State of People Analytics 2024 Advisory Board.

Working closely with HR.com’s HR Research Institute (HRRI), the newly-appointed advisory board will collaborate to positively influence the HR industry’s thought leadership and best practices through primary research. People analytics, aka HR analytics or workforce analytics, is the process of collecting and analyzing data to guide decision-making and improve workforce and talent management.

The advisory board provides an opportunity for thought leaders to participate in discussions on this topic, share knowledge, and provide valuable insights that will guide research surveys and capture the pulse of the HR community. The board of experts will guide senior HR professionals as they broaden and enrich their knowledge of people analytics. This research explores what today’s HR practitioners are saying and doing about workforce analytics practices in their organization to help improve productivity, engagement, and business success overall.

The findings will be published in a major HR Research Institute study and will be further distilled into a two-page infographic. It will also be featured in the upcoming HR.com’s State of People Analytics Virtual Event [REGISTER FOR FREE], which is scheduled for September 18, 2024. The advisory board will be valuable in recommending presenters, session topics, and helping to make the event best-in-class for HR professionals in attendance.

* Chris Coleman, People Analytics Partner, Western Governors University
* Jenna Filipkowski, People Science Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of New York
* Kevin Gorman, Head of HR Data Transformation, Wells Fargo
