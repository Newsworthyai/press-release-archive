# HRO Today Tackles Uncertainty, Celebrates HR's Best at the 2024 HRO Today Forum North America

Philadelphia, PA (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday May 7, 2024 @ 10:00 AM Pacific — SharedXpertise Media, publishers of HRO Today magazine, producers of the Baker’s Dozen Customer Satisfaction Ratings, and organizers of the HRO Today Forums and Educational Events, celebrated, educated, and connected HR leaders across industries at the 2024 HRO Today Forum North America at the Gaylord Texan Resort in Grapevine, TX from May 1-3.

Anchored by a theme of Leading Through Uncertainty, this year's event had a unique element from past HRO Today Forums with the absence of SharedXpertise CEO/Leader/Host Elliot Clark, who nonetheless managed to set the tone for the entire event with thought-provoking opening remarks via video that were referenced by speakers and attendees throughout the three days.

The content portion of the Forum featured Think Tank sessions on a range of topics like data, DE&I, Hard To Fill Jobs, and more. These sessions are moderated open forums that allow the leaders to exchange ideas, concepts, and points of view with peers. Also at the event was the announcement of the prestigious HRO Today Baker's Dozen Customer Satisfaction Ratings for Managed Service Program (MSP) for 2024. That list can be found online here.

The highlight of the HRO Today Forum is always the annual CHRO of the Year Awards Gala, this year held at the stunning Glass Cactus Nightclub on Lake Grapevine. The 2024 Award Winners, by category, are:
