# RedBalloon Teams Up with Newsworthy.ai for Media Communications

Boerne, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday May 7, 2024 @ 1:01 PM Central — RedBalloon.work announced the addition of Newsworthy.ai to the list of trusted Freedom Economy partners. RedBalloon.work, America’s #1 pro-freedom job board, recruiter, and talent connector has shaken up the job board market by emphasizing companies’ right to hire people who align with their workplace culture and mission.

RedBalloon has also gone after the high-priced corporate recruiters, offering a values-and-mission-aligned alternative recruiting role that features a fixed-rate cost, rather than the huge floating percentage fees. As a result, RedBalloon has enjoyed exponential growth in the hiring marketplace – growth that has set the big job boards on their heels.

“We believe a good hire is a culture-first hire,” said RedBalloon CEO Andrew Crapuchettes. “Culture trumps skills and experience. You can hire the most skilled software engineer, but if he or she doesn’t have the right work ethic or positive teamwork attitude, they’ll be a cancer to your company.”

RedBalloon is now largely considered one of the founding cornerstones of the emerging parallel economy, or “Freedom Economy.”

“People are tired of having politics shoved in their face at every turn,” continued Crapuchettes. “At work, they just want to apply their skills and talents to achieve and build a career. They don’t want to be canceled because of their faith, or preached at by DEI evangelists because they happen to have a different skin color. They just want workplaces that will value them for their merit and achievements, and that won’t divide them for their race or gender.”

RedBalloon Recruiter is one of the unique hiring innovations that has caught the attention of small and large businesses. The recruiter team starts by learning a company’s culture and mission. They then help write the job postings, conduct a market salary survey to be sure a job posting is in the right range, and they source-and-screen dozens of resumes from RedBalloon’s national job seeker database and other sources.

Instead of charging fees of 25% or more of the new hires’ first-year salary, RedBalloon Recruiter charges a flat fee of $4,500 per hire, plus a success bonus. Employers love it.

“RedBalloon Recruiter is so much better than traditional recruiting and at a much lower cost,” said Elliot Dickison, co-founder & CEO of Treefort Systems. “It’s the innovation that the recruiter world has needed for a long time.”

Media Intelligence Group CIO Tyler Houlten added that “RedBalloon is the best choice out there. In just 2 weeks, they found a strong list of great candidates that fit my company’s culture. I cannot recommend them enough.”

But RedBalloon isn’t stopping there. In the coming weeks, they are rolling out an innovative applicant tracking system (ATS) which will allow Freedom Economy companies to build their own personalized talent network. Sign up for free here

“The ATS is super important because a lot of current ATS systems actually use left-leaning algorithms to skew results, even for employers who aren’t left-leaning,” said Crapuchettes. “Freedom economy businesses are tired of big tech injecting its politics into everything, and our ATS will provide a clean algorithm and a culture-first hiring view.”

“We’re innovating at a tremendous pace, and our goal is to provide employers with a new, effective pathway to beating this very difficult labor market,” concluded Crapuchettes.

Regarding the partnership between RedBalloon and Newsworthy.ai, RedBalloon Communications Director Isaac Lopez states “We use Newsworthy.ai here at RedBalloon and strongly recommend the service to other freedom economy businesses.”

"We're excited to partner with RedBalloon and support their mission by equipping their clients with our AI-powered press release generation platform,” Mark Willaman, Newsworthy.ai Co-Founder, said. “Together, we're helping to drive greater awareness and recognition of the Freedom Economy and the incredible entrepreneurs and innovators who are redefining the way we work."
