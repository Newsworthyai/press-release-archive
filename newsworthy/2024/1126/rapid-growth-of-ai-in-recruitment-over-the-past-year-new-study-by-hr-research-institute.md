# Rapid Growth of AI in Recruitment Over the Past Year - New Study by HR Research Institute

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Nov 26, 2024 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — HR.com’s HR Research Institute’s latest study, HR.com’s Future of AI and Recruitment Technologies 2024-25, reveals a seismic shift in the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in talent acquisition (TA). The use of AI in hiring processes has nearly doubled in one year, soaring from 26% in 2023 to 53% in 2024.

While organizations are advancing their recruitment technology capabilities, the study reveals considerable room for improvement in adopting and optimizing modern tools to meet current hiring demands.

Key Findings:

* Recruitment Tech Performance Lags: Only 45% of HR professionals rate their recruitment tech stacks as good or excellent—a slight increase from 39% last year. This leaves over half of organizations stuck at average or below-average levels, slowing their ability to attract top talent.

* Mismatch in Job Advertising Methods and Effectiveness: While 82% of organizations advertise jobs on their company website and 78% on job boards, only 32% and 53%, respectively, find these methods effective.
* Lagging Mobile Optimization: Only 50% of respondents believe their job application processes are optimized for mobile, leaving the other half struggling to catch up in a mobile-first world. This failure to leverage mobile recruiting results in missed opportunities to connect with a broader and more responsive talent pool.
* AI Adoption Drives Superior Results: Organizations with advanced recruitment technology are reaping the benefits of artificial intelligence. These companies are:
