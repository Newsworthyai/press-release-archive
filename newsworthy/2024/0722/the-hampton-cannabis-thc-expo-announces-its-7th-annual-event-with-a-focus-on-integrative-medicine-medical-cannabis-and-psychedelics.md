Southampton, NY (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Jul 22, 2024 @ 10:50 AM Pacific — The 7th Annual Hamptons Cannabis Event, "Psychedelics & Cannabis in Chronic Disease Management: Integrative Medicine Approaches," reflects a strategic shift to align with the latest trends in medical cannabis and psychedelic therapies. Set for August 1, 2024, at the Shinnecock Nations wholly owned dispensary Little Beach Harvest, Southampton, NY, this event aims to reshape the future of medical cannabis and psychedelics in chronic disease management. More information and registration details are available at canxpo.com.

Evolving Trends in Psychedelics and Medical Cannabis

Public perception and evolving regulations are pushing psychedelics and medical cannabis into mainstream medical research. Over 50 sites in the U.S. are conducting clinical trials on psychedelics for conditions such as depression and PTSD, with institutions like the Cleveland Clinic and Johns Hopkins leading the way.

Public Support and Legislative Changes

Approximately 65% of Americans see therapeutic potential in psychedelics for mental health issues. This rising acceptance is reflected in legislative efforts, such as the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act, which funds psychedelic research for PTSD treatment among veterans. The FDA's new guidelines for psychedelic clinical trials highlight the growing recognition of these substances' potential.

Event Focus and Key Participants

Gary Bierfriend, creator and producer of the THC Expo, emphasizes the importance of sharing the latest research and integrative approaches with a dedicated audience. The event will bring together clinicians, pharma and biotech representatives, investors, legal experts, and wellness product developers to explore new integrative medicine approaches.

The Shinnecock Nation's sovereign lands provide a culturally rich backdrop, highlighting the importance of traditional and plant-based healing practices. The Shinnecock people’s history of using natural remedies aligns perfectly with the event's focus on integrative medicine.

Event Highlights

Returning special guest Tremaine S. Wright, Chair of the New York State Office of Cannabis Management, will deliver insights on regulatory developments and the future of medical cannabis. Dr. Natanya Wachtel, an award-winning behavioral psychology scientist, will host a panel on "Psychedelics and Cannabis in Integrative Medicine Approaches for Chronic Disease Management."
