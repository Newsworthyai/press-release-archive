Jenkins and Hines share how this initiative fosters collaboration between property owners, local businesses, and creatives, sparking a vibrant new energy in Comfort.
* Reviving Tourism: VisitComfortTX.com and its aligned social media platforms are integral to the effort, showcasing events like Diva Day and Girls Night Out and encouraging tourism that aligns with Comfort’s eclectic and artisan-friendly identity.

“This initiative is about more than filling empty spaces.
