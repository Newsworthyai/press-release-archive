# Using HR Technology to Gain Actionable Insights From Analytics Is the Biggest Tech Challenge for HR - New Study by HR.com’s HR Research Institute

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Jun 4, 2024 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — Employee experience is a top priority (54%) for HR professionals when it comes to their HR technology features, but new research sheds light on pain points and features needing improvement in the HR tech stacks in today’s organizations. The biggest struggle for HR is leveraging technology to gain useful people analytics. While most respondents can extract accurate data, translating it into actionable insights remains a challenge.

The free research report, HR.com’s State of Today's HR Tech Stack and Integrations 2024, provides the complete report with insights and actionable recommendations and is now available for download. HR.com's Research Institute conducted the study with HR professionals to better understand the trends, pain points, and potential solutions in the realm of HR technology.

These findings also reveal that in addition to using tech for people analytics, another common pain point is ensuring smooth integration among all technology. Strong integration is a defining feature of leading HR tech stacks, but 30% of respondents say they’re held back from attaining their important HR goals by a lack of tech integration.

“Companies today are investing heavily in HR technology, but the real challenge lies in integrating these tools and making them user-friendly,” stated Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator and CEO of HR.com. “It's not just about having the latest technology; it's about making it work seamlessly to meet business objectives and enhance the employee experience.“
