# TMS NW in Vancouver, Washington Offers Cutting-Edge TMS Therapy for Depression and OCD

Vancouver, WA (Newsworthy.ai) Saturday Jan 27, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Eastern â€” TMS NW, a leading provider of innovative mental health treatments, is delighted to offer Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) therapy to clients in the Vancouver area. TMS is a non-invasive treatment that stimulates the brain region responsible for symptoms of depression and OCD, resulting in significant improvement and potentially leading to remission.

According to TMS NW, TMS therapy involves the placement of a small coil over the head, delivering electrical stimulation to the brain through a magnetic field. During therapy sessions, patients can be comfortably seated in a chair while a helmet generates brief magnetic fields. This method allows patients to hear a tapping sound and feel a tapping sensation in the head area. After each session, patients can return home independently and immediately resume their daily routine.

TMS therapy has gained recognition as an effective alternative for patients who have not responded to previous medication treatments. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends TMS as a treatment for depressive episodes in adult patients with Major Depressive Disorder and OCD. However, it's essential to note that TMS should not be used if the patient has metal implants in or around the head.

It is important to note that TMS is FDA-cleared for the treatment of depression, OCD, anxiety, and smoking cessation. However, for other indications such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, migraines, and autism, TMS is still considered investigational.

While TMS NW focuses on administering TMS therapy, they encourage clients to continue care with their therapist to complement the treatment and achieve the best results.
