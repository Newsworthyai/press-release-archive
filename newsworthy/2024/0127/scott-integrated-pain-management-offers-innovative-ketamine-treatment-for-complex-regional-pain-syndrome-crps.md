Philadelphia, PA (Newsworthy.ai) Saturday Jan 27, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Eastern â€” Scott Integrated Pain Management, a premier healthcare provider specializing in chronic pain management, is thrilled to announce the introduction of Ketamine treatment for patients grappling with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS). This groundbreaking therapy aims to bring relief to individuals experiencing severe and debilitating pain.

CRPS, characterized by intense and continuous pain that worsens over time, often leaves patients without adequate relief from traditional treatments. This has fueled the need for alternative options that can help individuals regain control of their lives. Ketamine, originally developed as a dissociative anesthetic for surgery, has shown great promise in significantly reducing pain and improving the quality of life for CRPS patients.

Recent research has highlighted Ketamine's effectiveness in managing chronic pain conditions, including CRPS. By modulating pain receptors in the brain, Ketamine disrupts the cycle of pain signaling, providing respite to individuals burdened by constant discomfort.

Patients undergoing Ketamine therapy at Scott Integrated Pain Management can anticipate a comprehensive evaluation to determine their eligibility. Treatment plans are tailored to individual requirements, ensuring the most effective and safe outcomes. Scott Integrated Pain Management accepts various insurance plans, including Medicare, United Healthcare, Independence Blue Cross Blue Shield, Cigna, and Highmark BlueShield, making this groundbreaking treatment accessible to a wide range of patients.
