# TMS Treatment for OCD Offers Effective Relief for Patients Resistant to First-Line Treatments

Columbus, OH (Newsworthy.ai) Saturday Jan 27, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Eastern â€” Optimum TMS, a leading provider of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) therapy, is introducing an innovative treatment option for individuals grappling with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Research indicates that approximately 45-55% of patients experience a significant reduction in OCD symptoms following TMS treatment.

TMS therapy utilizes a magnetic field to target deeper brain regions associated with OCD, offering a safe and effective solution for patients who have not responded well to traditional treatments. With over 2 million adults diagnosed with OCD each year, Optimum TMS aims to provide relief for those resistant to first-line therapies.

Throughout the TMS therapy process, patients undergo 29 sessions with an MRI machine. While some individuals may experience mild side effects such as headaches or gastrointestinal discomfort, these effects typically diminish after 1-2 months. The positive effects of TMS treatment for OCD can last between six months to one year after completing the full course of treatment.

Optimum TMS provides personalized treatment plans for individuals seeking relief from OCD symptoms. Weekly assessments and access to additional support resources ensure that patients receive comprehensive care throughout their treatment journey. Priced at $362 per session, Optimum TMS also offers flexible payment plans and financing options to make TMS treatment accessible to individuals in need.

As pioneers in TMS therapy, Optimum TMS is dedicated to advancing the field through ongoing clinical research. Their studies consistently demonstrate the efficacy of TMS treatment for OCD, even in patients who have failed multiple medications and therapy.
