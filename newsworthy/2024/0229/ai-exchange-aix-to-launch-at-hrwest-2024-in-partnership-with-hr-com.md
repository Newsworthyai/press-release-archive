# AI Exchange (AIX) to Launch at HRWest 2024, in Partnership with HR.com

Oakland, California (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Feb 29, 2024 @ 8:00 AM Central — AI Exchange (AIX), developed in partnership with HR.com, the leading community for HR professionals worldwide, will officially launch in early March at HRWest 2024, a premier industry event to be held March 5-6 in Oakland, CA. AIX’s mission is to create a dynamic learning community that fosters expert and peer support to responsibly and effectively harness AI’s transformative power, promoting trust, fairness, inclusion, collaboration, professional development, and sustainable business growth for the HR community.

AIX will be home to expert panels and podcasts involving the most respected forward-thinkers in AI, HR, and across all functional disciplines within an organization: Finance, IT, Strategy, and Operations. The platform will feature moderated forums for real-time and asynchronous dialogue/constructive debate on the risks, challenges, and opportunities that AI presents. Later this year, AIX will introduce a marketplace of curated solutions, services, and resources that adhere to responsible AI principles.

“HR.com’s partnership demonstrates their commitment to upholding the core principles of Responsible AI - human-centric, transparent, fair, inclusive, and ethical – and to supporting organizations as they grapple with AI’s disruptive impact,” said Bob Pulver, AIX co-founder. “We look forward to collaborating with other partners and thought leaders who share these values, and are committed to building a vibrant learning community for HR.com’s nearly 2 million HR practitioners.”

The AIX Pavilion at HRWest 2024

AIX will officially launch at HRWest 2024, a gathering of over 1,000 global HR professionals seeking insights and guidance on top HR and talent technologies, trends, and strategies. AIX will lead a session on Day 2 titled: What's Your AIQ: What you need to know to successfully augment your work in the age of AI. Facilitated by AIX’s Bob Pulver, this session will explore the critical success criteria for the evolution of work, including why elevating ‘AIQ’ - at individual, team, and organizational levels - is vital to growth and competitive advantage in this AI-powered future. AIX will be joined by Ioanna Mantzouridou Onasi (Dextego) and Cesar Pavlavicini (Learning Factory). Both “foundational partner” companies will also be exhibiting in the AIX Pavillion.

“AIX enables us to provide HR practitioners around the world with clarity, direction, and support in navigating the challenges – and leveraging the opportunities - of AI,” said Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator at HR.com. “HRWest is a perfect place to launch, as it will bring together in one place practitioners looking for insights, and solutions for building sustainable workforces, and the leading solution providers building such technologies. The partnership with AIX underscores our commitment to providing HR professionals with cutting-edge resources and insights to drive meaningful change in their organizations."
