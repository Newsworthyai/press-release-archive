# CannabisRadio.com Launches New Podcast on Revolutionary Psychedelic Therapies

Miami, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Jun 25, 2024 @ 8:00 AM Eastern — CannabisRadio.com, the preeminent podcast network once focused exclusively on cannabis topics, has expanded its charter to seek out companies and individuals offering the best and most efficacious products and services to support mental health, wellness, and longevity. In line with this mission, CannabisRadio.com is proud to announce the launch of its new podcast, "Psychedelic Breakthrough Addiction Therapy," hosted by renowned neuroscientist Deborah Mash, PhD. This bi-weekly half-hour show will explore cutting-edge research advancing breakthrough addiction therapies, with a focus on psychedelic medicines and other innovative alternative approaches.

"We believe information is power, but the wrong information can put people in harm’s way," said Brandy Shapiro-Babin, President of CannabisRadio.com. "We are doing the deep dive into ongoing scientific and medical research to ensure that interested listeners are well informed and not mislead by misinformation. Our goal is to provide accurate, reliable, and valuable content that can truly make a difference in people's lives." Psychedelics — though mostly still illegal — have surged in popularity in recent years as alternative treatments for mental health disorders including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and drug and alcohol addictions. While psychedelics are showing real promise for therapeutic use, they can be dangerous for some.

The podcast's first six episodes will delve into the topic of Ibogaine, a naturally occurring psychoactive substance derived from the Iboga plant, native to West Africa. Ibogaine has gained attention for its potential as an addiction treatment for opioids, alcohol, cocaine and other abused substances. Its unique properties offer a promising tool for advancing neuroscience research and for development of non-addicting medicines, bringing new hope to those who struggle with drug and alcohol addiction.

Deborah Mash, a leading expert in the field of addiction neuroscience and neuropharmacology, brings her extensive knowledge and thirty years of academic and entrepreneurial experience to the podcast. She has advanced basic and clinical pharmacology studies of ibogaine. She is considered one of the world’s foremost experts on Ibogaine. She is credited with the discovery of noribogaine, a non-hallucinogenic metabolite of ibogaine that mediates some of its beneficial effects.

Deborah Mash is an American professor emerita of neurology and molecular and cellular pharmacology at the Miller School of Medicine, and founder and former director of the Brain Endowment Bank at the University of Miami. She is nationally recognized as a leading NIH funded researcher contributing to the fields of addiction neurobiology, genomics, aging and psychedelic medicine, playing a pivotal role in over 300 scientific publications. She is a faculty member in the Kiran A. Patel College of Allopathic Medicine at Nova Southeastern University and a scientific advisor to Cure Addiction Now organization in Los Angeles, CA.

She is Chief Executive Officer and founder of DemeRx, a clinical stage drug development company advancing non-addicting treatments for alcohol and opioid use disorders.

"I am thrilled to host the 'Psychedelic Breakthrough Addiction Therapy' podcast on CannabisRadio.com," said Deborah Mash. "This platform allows us to shed light on groundbreaking therapies like Ibogaine and discuss their potential to transform the lives of those suffering from addiction. Our goal is to provide hope, insight, and a deeper understanding of these promising treatments."

CannabisRadio.com invites listeners to tune in to "Psychedelic Breakthrough Addiction Therapy" to join Dr. Mash on a journey through the fascinating world of psychedelic medicines .
