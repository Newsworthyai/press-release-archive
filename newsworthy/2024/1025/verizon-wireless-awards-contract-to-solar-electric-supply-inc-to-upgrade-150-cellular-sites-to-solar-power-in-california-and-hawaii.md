# Verizon Wireless Awards Contract to Solar Electric Supply, Inc to upgrade 150 Cellular Sites to Solar Power in California and Hawaii

Scotts Valley, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Oct 25, 2024 @ 6:00 AM Pacific — Solar Electric Supply, Inc, a leading distributor of renewable energy solutions, has been awarded a purchase contract by Verizon Wireless to supply solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays for 150 cellular sites across California and Hawaii as part of Verizon's On-Site Green Energy Generation program. The project will enhance network resiliency and sustainability by integrating solar power to support site operations during power outages.

The solar power systems at these critical cell sites will supplement existing power infrastructure by directly supplying power to the DC bus in the battery backup systems, extending the duration of backup power and reducing reliance on the grid. The 150 sites, spread across Northern California, Southern California, and Hawaii, posed unique challenges due to the shading effects of cell towers and other telecom infrastructure. To overcome these obstacles, SES worked closely with Verizon to select the REC 410AA Pure R solar module—a high-performance panel featuring four quadrants of shading protection, compared to the standard two quadrants found in most modern solar panels. This advanced shading technology ensures optimal energy production at these challenging sites, maximizing the efficiency and resilience of Verizon's solar installations.

"Working with Solar Electric Supply was great," said Roger Maiorano, solar project lead for Verizon. "Our cell sites have some challenging design aspects with the towers and telecom shelters. They offered a variety of solar modules that met our project criteria and then helped us select the optimum panel for our sites. They also recommended some of their local solar contractors to assist in the construction of these systems."A Partnership for Sustainability and Network ResiliencyThis contract with Solar Electric Supply aligns with Verizon's broader efforts to reduce its environmental footprint and improve the resiliency of its network. Verizon has committed to generating more on-site renewable energy and meeting ambitious sustainability goals, including sourcing 100% renewable energy equivalent to their annual electricity usage by 2030. With over 37.6 megawatts of on-site renewable energy projects already in operation, Verizon’s investments are part of a strategy to bolster network integrity while reducing carbon emissions and contributing to a greener future.

Verizon's investment in solar power is driven by several key factors:* Environmental Impact: With a combination of solar and fuel cell investments, Verizon's green energy system will exceed 25 megawatts, helping to offset 22,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. This reduction is equivalent to the electricity used in 8,500 homes or the greenhouse gas emissions from nearly 5,000 passenger vehicles.
* Network Resiliency: Verizon is committed to running the nation’s most reliable network, which requires ongoing investment in network integrity. Integrating solar power at cellular sites helps reduce grid dependency and enhances service continuity during power outages, ensuring uninterrupted service even during extreme weather events or disasters.
* Return on Investment: Verizon's investment in green energy is not solely about sustainability—it also makes financial sense. The company anticipates a positive return on investment over the coming years, driven by declining costs of renewable energy and the benefits of the Federal Investment Tax Credit.
* Long-Term Sustainability Goals: Verizon aims to achieve net-zero operational emissions and meet its goal of reducing carbon intensity by 50% from 2009 levels. The move toward on-site green energy generation is a critical component of Verizon’s broader sustainability strategy.

The REC 410AA Pure R solar modules provided by SES are uniquely suited to the shading conditions often found at cellular infrastructure locations, where the presence of towers and other structures can significantly impact solar efficiency. By deploying panels with advanced shading technology, Verizon is not only enhancing the reliability of its critical communication infrastructure but also reducing greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to the fight against climate change.
