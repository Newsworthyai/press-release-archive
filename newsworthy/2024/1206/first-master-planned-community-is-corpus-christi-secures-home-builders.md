Corpus Christi, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Dec 6, 2024 @ 8:00 AM US/Central — Whitecap NPI has selected Azali Homes and Newcastle Homes, award-winning local custom home builders, as its Showcase of Homes builders.

Both builders will begin constructing the Showcase of Homes in December 2024, with anticipated completion in the fourth quarter of 2025.

These custom-designed homes will enhance the coastal living experience and highlight the natural surroundings of the destination resort and residential community.

“We are proud to be part of the visionary Whitecap NPI community," said Sara Azali, CEO and owner at Azali Homes. “Having built along the Texas Coast for 20 years, this innovative project allows us to create spaces where residents can truly connect with the beauty and vibrancy of island living. We’re excited to bring our expertise to this remarkable development."Newcastle Homes will be building three-story floor plans designed by Place Designers ranging from 2,358 to 2,787 square feet of livable space.

Azali Homes will construct two and three-story floor plans by Will & Fotsch Architects, ranging from 2,651 to 3,976 square feet of livable space.

These homes will showcase features including a rooftop terrace, elevator, pool, summer kitchen, boat dock, high-end appliances and professionally designed interiors.

"We are honored to be selected as one of the first home builders for this groundbreaking master-planned community in Corpus Christi," said John Pope, president of Newcastle Homes. "This is a unique opportunity to create homes that not only reflect our commitment to quality and craftsmanship but also embrace the island lifestyle and its natural habitats that make this area so special."

Upon completion, Whitecap NPI will span 240 acres and feature over 600 residential options, including single-family homes, villas, condos and cross-generational housing. The homes, many with canal access for boating and water sports, will be situated in island enclaves, creating unique neighborhoods connected by bridges, boardwalks and pathways to the rest of the community.

The development will also include a 30-acre nature preserve designed to meticulously restore the natural barrier island habitat and serve as a refuge for a myriad of species.

"This marks an exciting step forward in bringing our vision for Whitecap NPI to life," said Terence Johnson, executive vice president and general manager at Ashlar Development. "Both Newcastle Homes and Azali Homes bring deep understanding of the coastal lifestyle and their appreciation for preserving its natural habitats aligns perfectly with our vision for this development."With the support of Strategyst LLC, homesites are currently available for sale.
