# Actionable Strategies Unveiled to Help SMBs Tackle Major HR Challenges - New Study by UKG and the HR Research Institute

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Aug 20, 2024 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — More than half of small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) are struggling with significant challenges in hiring, retention, and maintaining a positive company culture. Addressing these human resources (HR) challenges is essential for SMBs to thrive in today's dynamic business landscape, and adopting potential best practices and more strategic HR approaches may help improve HR performance.

The free research report, "HR Decision-Making in Small to Mid-Sized Businesses," is now available for download. Conducted by HR.com's HR Research Institute in collaboration with UKG, a global HR technology company, this study examines how HR professionals from businesses with fewer than 500 employees manage their strategic processes, HR practices, and responsibilities. The findings and takeaways provide valuable insights into the unique challenges and solutions for smaller organizations.

When asked about their biggest areas of concern, participating HR professionals point to retaining top talent (60%), creating a supportive employee culture (58%), and hiring qualified employees (56%). These concerns are well-founded given the current tight labor market and the intense competition from larger companies with more resources. Surprisingly, only 35% of SMBs cite employee reskilling and upskilling as a concern. Workforce learning and development (L&D) has gained more attention in recent years, as one effective strategy for filling open positions and retaining employees is to provide them with additional skills.

It’s interesting to note that SMBs with more mature HR-related operations are more likely to prioritize manager skills and quality hiring compared to companies with less mature HR. In contrast, the latter organizations are still more focused on fundamentals, such as complying with employment laws. As SMB HR develops and matures, more organizations may see the value of manager training and more focus on strategic effective hiring.

Further investigation highlights differences in how technology is applied and implemented in these companies. HR leader organizations with more mature human capital management are considerably more likely to be at the strategic and advanced levels of HR technology usage. Research insights suggest that aligning HR tech investments with leadership business goals can go a long way to not only boost efficiency and compliance but drive better decision-making and organizational success.

HR professionals and managers from SMBs can also view the recorded session, “The Art of Finding and Keeping Top Talent: Expert Insights for Lean HR Teams”, to hear expert insights from Teresa Smith, director, UKG human insights and HCM advocacy, and Mark Vickers, HR.com chief research analyst, that will help SMB HR transform their function into a strategic business asset.

“Having the right HR technology in place at businesses with leaner teams is crucial, so HR professionals can think strategically while helping the company scale,” said Julie Develin, senior partner, HCM advisory at UKG. “By building on the right foundational areas, HR technology improves workflows, streamlines roadblocks, and enhances the overall employee experience.”

“Strategic investment in HR technology may be a game-changer for SMBs,” stated Debbie McGrath, chief instigator and CEO of HR.com. “By adopting intentional strategies in HR processes and investing in effective tech, SMBs can better navigate their HR challenges and thrive in an increasingly competitive environment.”
