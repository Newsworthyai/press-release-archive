# Ranger Creek Brewing and Distillings 305 Single Malt is Crowned Top Texas Whiskey

Bee Cave, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Apr 9, 2024 @ 11:00 AM Central — The Texas Whiskey Festival hosts a competition each year to determine the best Texas Bourbon, Rye, Malt Whiskey, and the newly added Flavored Whiskeys. The winners are chosen by a panel of judges in a blind tasting.

“We view the contest and awards as a guide for people to discover new whiskeys,” says Co-Founder Jake Clements. Everything entered in the contest is available for purchase by the bottle or glass, with some being in distribution and others being distillery-only releases.

These are the winners chosen by a panel of judges based on their opinions and palates regarding the whiskey's enjoyability and drinkability. Each judge's opinion and palate vary, so remember that the best whiskey is the one you like.
