# EcS+: Pioneering Cost Savings and Efficiency for Businesses and Non-Profits

Carmel, NY (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Apr 9, 2024 @ 6:00 AM Pacific — In an economic landscape marked by rising inflation and financial uncertainty, EcS+, a distinguished women-owned advisory firm, is leading the charge in cost savings and expense reduction services for corporations, non-profit organizations, and municipalities. With over 30 years of experience and a unique vendor-based compensation model, EcS+ offers unparalleled expertise in reducing operational expenses across seven key market segments.

A Legacy of Savings and Efficiency

EcS+ stands out in the advisory field for its deep-rooted connections and seasoned professionalism, developed over three decades. These relationships enable EcS+ to negotiate significant cost savings on behalf of its clients, ensuring no downside risk or obligation. The firm's track record is impeccable, with no client departures in over 30 years, thanks to the substantial double-digit savings achieved.

EcS+ business model is unique in that has developed unique partnerships in the USA that provide customers with substantial cost and expense savings at no cost to the customer. The original model was created by the founding owners in 2002, the same year it received a formal endorsement from GE Capital.

The original managing partners, Gene Cordiano and Marc-André Buenger serve as an Advisory Board to EcS+ who is now owned by Angela Briante, the sole Managing Principal. Over their careers, Gene and Marc-André worked in investment banking for the Americans, the Germans, the French, the British, and the Swiss. These managing partners have global investment banking experience and relationships at the most senior levels, with the most elite institutions (UBS, Merrill Lynch, BNY Mellon, Groupe BPCE- Natixis, ICAP, Portigon AG, etc ) as well as CEO positions in major corporations. Angela Briante comes from the Real Estate Brokerage space and compliments her Real Estate Brokerage with an off-shoot of what the founding partners began in 2002.

"In these times of economic uncertainty, EcS+ remains steadfast in our commitment to delivering unparalleled cost savings and efficiency solutions to businesses and non-profits alike," stated Angela Briante, ECS+ Managing Principal. "As the new Managing Principal, I am proud to lead a team dedicated to driving innovation and delivering tangible results for our clients, ensuring their sustainability and growth in a challenging landscape."
