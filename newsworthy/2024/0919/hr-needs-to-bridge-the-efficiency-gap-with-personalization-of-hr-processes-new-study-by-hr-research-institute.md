# HR Needs To Bridge the Efficiency Gap With Personalization of HR Processes - New Study by HR Research Institute

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Sep 19, 2024 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — New research by HR.com’s HR Research Institute (HRRI) reveals a major disconnect when it comes to HR personalization. Although 65% of HR professionals say the importance of personalized HR services and experiences has increased over the last two years, fewer than half of them (32%) say their firms offer personalized HR services to a high or very high extent. This raises the question for employers about how they should address this situation.

The study, HR.com's Future of Personalized HR Services and Experiences 2024-25, outlines various strategies for HR teams looking to evolve their personalization efforts, from leveraging advanced HR technologies to adopting more flexible, employee-centric models that drive engagement and productivity.

To accomplish this, HR professionals must cope with various barriers that hinder personalization efforts, such as:

* Securing adequate budget: 43% of respondents cite lack of sufficient financial resources as a significant challenge.
* Efficient administration: 40% of organizations struggle with the complexity of managing personalized HR services at scale.
* Alignment with business priorities: 37% of HR leaders find it difficult to align individual employee needs with overarching business goals.

“Helping our people do their best work is often about personalization. It’s one of the best ways of empowering employees,” stated Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator and CEO of HR.com. “By doing so, companies will not only boost employee satisfaction but also, if it’s done right, streamline HR operations.”

The full research report, HR.com's Future of Personalized HR Services and Experiences 2024-25, is available for free download and offers detailed insights and actionable recommendations for HR professionals looking to improve workforce communication and collaboration, to positively impact employee engagement, productivity, and quality of work.
