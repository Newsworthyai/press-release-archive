# It’s Time for a Change: Lisa Moretti, County Commissioner Candidate Launches V.O.I.C.E. Campaign in Pasco County Florida

Pasco County, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Sep 19, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Eastern — Lisa Moretti, candidate for Pasco County Commissioner, is endorsing a new grassroots initiative by Pasco County residents called “Use Your V.O.I.C.E.”, which stands for "Vote Out Incumbents (in the) Coming Election." The V.O.I.C.E. campaign calls on Pasco County residents to send a clear message to current leaders who have prioritized developers and outside interests over the people they are meant to serve. Moretti agrees with their simple message: it’s time for new leadership that puts the needs of Pasco residents first.

"For too long, the incumbent politicians in Pasco County have listened to the developers instead of the residents," said Moretti. "They’ve approved reckless development, ignored our infrastructure needs, and allowed our schools, roads, and public services to fall behind. It’s time to vote them out and bring in leaders who will fight for the people of Pasco County."

A Legacy of Neglect

Moretti argues that the current incumbents have allowed Pasco County to become a playground for out-of-town developers, while residents bear the brunt of the consequences—overcrowded schools, clogged roadways, strained emergency services, and rising property taxes. She believes the county has been run with little accountability to Pasco residents and that they have been left out of the planning process.

"The current leadership has treated Pasco County like an ATM for developers," Moretti said. "They’ve deferred impact fees, allowed unchecked growth, and left our communities with the problems—higher taxes, worse traffic, and schools that can’t keep up. We deserve better."

V.O.I.C.E. for Real Change

The grassroots V.O.I.C.E. initiative calls on Pasco County residents to demand change this election. Moretti stands shoulder to shoulder with the residents after her advocacy on their behalf. Her platform focuses on putting residents first by slowing down overdevelopment, holding developers accountable for infrastructure costs, and ensuring that future growth benefits the community, not just the developers.

The V.O.I.C.E. initiative is built around key principles that are congruent with Moretti’s platform, including:

Vote for Real Representation

Moretti’s campaign highlights the need for elected officials who will stand up for the residents of Pasco County and, at the very least, take their calls, not developers or outside interests. She vows to bring transparency and accountability back to local government.

End Deferred Impact Fees

Moretti’s has called for the end of the practice of deferred impact fees that let developers profit while residents pay the price. She believes developers must contribute to infrastructure improvements before building, to ensure the county is ready to handle growth. Residents are required to pay impact fees in a timely manner, developers should be too.

Empower Residents

Moretti wants to restore residents' voices in the planning process by holding public meetings at accessible times and making county planning transparent. She is committed to ensuring that residents have a real say in shaping the future of their communities.

Protect Our Resources

Moretti’s says protecting Pasco County’s natural resources, including its water supply and green spaces are crucial to the future of the county, which she believes have been sacrificed in the name of rapid development.

"The V.O.I.C.E. campaign is about making sure Pasco County residents are heard again," Moretti said. "I applaud our residents who recognize the need to vote out the incumbents who have ignored us for too long and bring in leaders who will put our families, our communities, and our future first. Residents have a rare opportunity to reorient the future of Pasco County – they have FOUR commission seats to vote for!"

A New Path Forward

Lisa Moretti’s own platform complements the V.O.I.C.E. initiative to build a better Pasco County—one that is driven by thoughtful planning, respect for residents, and accountability in government. She believes that by voting out the incumbents who have put developers ahead of the people, Pasco County can start to rebuild trust and create a more sustainable, people-centered future.

"It’s time for real change in Pasco County," Moretti said. "The incumbent politicians have had their chance, and they’ve failed to put residents first. If residents use their V.O.I.C.E., we can make sure this election brings in new leadership that cares about the future of our communities. Let’s give Pasco County the voice it deserves."
