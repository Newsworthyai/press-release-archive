# PG&E and Solar Electric Supply Launch Fully Operational Solar Hybrid Power System for Pittsburg CA Landfill Biomethane Project

Scotts Valley, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Oct 31, 2024 @ 12:15 PM Pacific — PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG) and Solar Electric Supply Inc. are pleased to announce the full operational launch of a groundbreaking MAPPS® hybrid solar PV power system at the Pittsburg, CA landfill biomethane project. Initially delivered in August 2023, the system is now fully operational, with PG&E reporting flawless performance since July 2024.

Solar Electric Supply designed the MAPPS® hybrid solar system to provide renewable primary critical power for monitoring and control equipment for the Biomethane Project.

The collaboration between PG&E and Solar Electric Supply underscores their shared commitment to harnessing innovative technologies for sustainable energy projects. The hybrid solar system ensures a consistent and reliable renewable power supply essential to the success of the landfill-gas-to-energy Project, developed by Ameresco, Inc. (NYSE:AMRC).

“We have worked with PG&E and Ameresco for over 12 years on many solar projects," says Garrett Gettleman, CEO of Solar Electric Supply. "But this project was different, truly demonstrating the future potential of integrating multiple renewable sources to the benefit of the local community.”Ameresco manages this renewable energy plant with PG&E, and the City of Pittsburg. Landfill gas contributes to local smog and greenhouse gas emissions and has either been flared or allowed to escape. The escaped gas is captured through extraction wells and converted to heat and electricity for use by the facility and the nearby community. PG&E purchases the gas wholesale from the facility.

"The MAPPS solar system was well designed, and the installation went smoothly. We really appreciated the onsite support. The automatic hybrid genset/solar operation was verified, ensuring reliable power to our client, Ameresco", said Glenn Rustia, the PG&E engineer responsible for the operation and maintenance of the system.

PG&E and Solar Electric Supply not only showcases the synergy between industry leaders but also sets an example for effective public-private collaborations in the pursuit of energy sustainability. With a focus on integrated solutions and renewable energy technologies, PG&E, Ameresco and Solar Electric Supply continue to lead the way in addressing the pressing challenges of climate change and a more resilient energy grid.

Solar Electric Supply worked closely with PG&E engineers to design and supply a custom MAPPS Hybrid Solar + Genset System tailored to the biomethane project's specific requirements. To facilitate local permitting and approval, Solar Electric Supply provided custom PE stamped engineering and Solar Plan Sets. Upon installation, they also offered onsite commissioning and system training to ensure smooth operation.

This custom MAPPS® System Features:* 6.4 kW solar array of Qcells G10+ 400 Watt modules mounted on a Unirac ULA custom racking system
* Three SES MAPPS Custom Battery and Electronics Enclosures
* Two 48V Parallel stacks of Deka Unigy II VRLA Batteries Made in USA
* Outback Dual Inverter System with four FM80 Controllers
