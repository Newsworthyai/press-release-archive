# Curbio Recognized as a Best Place to Work for Outstanding Employee Perks and Benefits

Potomac, MD (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Nov 12, 2024 @ 11:30 AM Eastern — Curbio, the leading pre-listing home improvement company that helps real estate agents prepare their clients' homes for sale, is thrilled to share its recognition in Comparably's 2024 Best Places to Work Awards as a three-time winner for Best Company Perks & Benefits. This award underscores Curbio’s commitment to creating a supportive workplace that prioritizes employee well-being and satisfaction, earning the company a notable place among the top 150 highest-rated workplaces.

“Curbio’s mission is to transform home improvement through our modern home repair and renovation model. The significant impact we have made on the real estate industry would not be possible without our incredible team of employees,” said Rick Rudman, President & CEO of Curbio. “Investing in the physical, emotional, and financial health of our team members is not just our responsibility, it’s essential for our success. Curbio is proud to be recognized for this important award, as it truly reflects the values and culture we have strived to build since day one.”

Curbio offers its employees a comprehensive benefits package that includes fully subsidized medical, dental, and vision plans, with significant support for dependent coverage, as well as mental and physical health resources including 7 Cups, Noom, and Eat Right Now. The company also provides up to 12 weeks of 100% paid time off for parental leave, allowing new parents the opportunity to fully bond with their newborns or newly adopted children without the financial stress often associated with extended time away from work.

As a remote-friendly workplace, Curbio equips its team with the necessary tools to ensure a productive and enjoyable work experience. Curbio’s unlimited time off policy empowers employees to take the time they need to recharge and maintain a healthy work-life balance, fostering greater job satisfaction and productivity. Ray Santibanez, Regional Director, who has been with Curbio for more than five years shared: “Curbio places a lot of trust in us and rewards us with incredible flexibility, which I greatly value. Just the other day, I was able to be there for my daughter to celebrate an award she won at school. My mother is aging, and it’s priceless for me to be there for her if she needs me. Those moments are so important in my life. Having this flexibility keeps me motivated and inspired to do my best work. This is the first time in my career that I have been at a company that gives me these important benefits. This flexibility and its positive impact on my life has significantly deepened my commitment and loyalty to Curbio.”

Curbio is dedicated to ensuring financial wellness and security by offering all employees a 401(k) plan with a generous matching structure, along with stock option grants that begin vesting immediately. Sarah Young, Director of Vendor Relations at Curbio, who has been with the company for a year, shares her perspective: “Curbio truly values our contributions, which is evident in the way they invest in us through stock options and 401(k) matching. It’s part of what I love about working here. This commitment fosters a sense of ownership for us all and reinforces that we are all working together toward shared success.”

As Curbio continues its mission of being the go-to contractor for real estate agents and sellers needing quality pre-listing home repairs and updates, the company remains committed to rewarding its employees’ hard work with outstanding benefits and perks. This award supports Curbio’s guiding principle that a satisfied and supported workforce is key to delivering exceptional service and achieving its mission to transform the real estate industry.
