# Businesses Need to Strengthen Employee Career Development - New Study by HR Research Institute

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Dec 23, 2024 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — A new research report, HR.com’s Future of Career Development and Mobility 2024-25, reveals that employee career development programs are falling short across many organizations. Only 20% of companies have reached the top two levels of program maturity, unveiling a significant need for improvement in supporting employee growth.

The study highlights significant gaps in career development and internal mobility efforts. Only 37% of organizations consider themselves effective in career development, while just 42% report success in internal mobility initiatives. Additionally, the research reveals that a mere 22% of organizations offer enough employee development opportunities to keep up with workforce demands. These findings underscore a critical need for organizations to prioritize career growth initiatives, particularly as employee expectations for development opportunities continue to rise.

Managers can play a pivotal role in fostering employee career development. A small majority (54%) of organizations report that managers are encouraged to help employees develop their careers. However, the research highlights concerning gaps in manager readiness and motivation:

* In 34% of organizations, managers actively discourage internal movement to retain high performers.
* Only 15% of companies have managers equipped with the necessary skills to develop employees.
* Just 10% of organizations recognize and reward managers for developing their direct reports.

“Managers are uniquely positioned to drive employee development, but they need the right training, tools, and incentives to succeed,” said Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator and CEO of HR.com. “Organizations that prioritize manager development can build a more engaged, agile, and productive workforce.”
