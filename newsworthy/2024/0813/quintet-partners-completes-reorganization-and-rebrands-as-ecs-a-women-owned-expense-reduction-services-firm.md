# Quintet Partners Completes Reorganization and Rebrands as EcS+: A Women-Owned Expense Reduction Services Firm

Carmel, NY (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Aug 13, 2024 @ 9:30 AM Pacific — EcS+, a distinguished women-owned expense reduction services firm, has announced the completion of its restructuring and rebranding from Quintet Partners to EcS+. The original founding partners at Quintet will serve on the Advisory Board to EcS+ which Angela Briante, the sole Managing Principal, now owns.

Background of Ms. Briante's Path to EcS+

Ms. Briante founded Briante Realty Group (BRG) in 2010 as a residentially focused real estate brokerage. Over the ensuing years, BRG expanded into the commercial real estate sector, handling various commercial real estate transactions such as chain restaurants, retail plazas, and warehouse facilities.

Ms. Briante recognized that managing operating costs and expenses was a continual battle for her commercial real estate clients, and often led to her client's delaying or suspending growth. This in turn impacted BRG's growth potential. According to Ms. Briante, "Rising operating expenses prevented many of BRG's commercial business clients from expanding locations and this impacted the growth of BRG's real-estate portfolio. Most businesses are challenged for resources and time and, as a consequence, their expense profiles were not always optimal."

This realization begged the question, how does a business outsource the expense reduction task to a trusted partner that focuses exclusively on expense reduction, without negatively affecting the bottom line through fees and retainers?

It was at this time Ms. Briante was introduced to Quintet Partners, a cost reduction advisory firm with 22 years of experience helping corporations, non-profit organizations, and municipalities reduce operational expenses.

"I shared my concerns with a lifelong mentor who connected me with Marc-André Buenger who was the Managing Partner at Quintet," explained Ms. Briante. "I began working with Quintet and quickly recognized the value of their services and how they provided immediate cost savings for BRG's commercial clients. Equally impressive was Quintet's no risk, no fee and no obligation approach to expense reduction services for its clients."

In 2023, after collaborating with Quintet Partners, Ms. Briante proposed reorganizing the business model to reach a broader and more diverse audience. This initiative resulted in the rebranding to EcS+ and Ms. Briante being appointed as the sole owner and Managing Principal.

Mr. Buenger expressed, "the Advisory Board is thrilled to enthusiastically support Ms. Briante in her role as owner and Managing Principal of EcS+, as the organization endeavors to partner with businesses of all sizes, to meaningfully reduce their operating costs, through a unique, no fee, no risk advocacy model."

“As the new Managing Principal, I am proud to lead a team dedicated to driving innovation and delivering tangible results for EcS+ clients, ensuring their sustainability and growth,” stated Ms. Briante.
