# HR Research Institute Unveils the Power of Strategy in High-Volume Recruitment

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Aug 13, 2024 @ 9:00 AM America/Toronto — Organizations with effective high-volume hiring capabilities are nearly eight times more likely to have a dedicated strategy compared to those with ineffective capabilities. Despite the clear benefits, few organizations currently have a robust high-volume recruitment strategy in place.

HR.com’s HR Research Institute (HRRI) has released a comprehensive new report exploring today’s unique recruitment processes to uncover actionable strategies to help employers improve their talent acquisition initiatives under the increasing demands of today’s hiring landscape. The findings reveal a critical insight: organizations with well-defined strategies for high-volume recruitment are significantly more effective than those without.

Further investigation identifies the practices that drive success with mass hiring initiatives:

* 65% of successful organizations automate as much of the recruitment process as possible.
* 65% focus on removing barriers to applying.
* 64% develop a compelling employer brand and value proposition.

In addition, outsourcing high-volume recruitment is a common strategy, with 52% of organizations opting to outsource at least part of the process. This approach allows companies to leverage external expertise and resources, especially when dealing with the complexities of large-scale hiring. The primary partners for outsourcing include:

* staffing agencies (62%)
* job boards and aggregators (57%)
* temporary employment services (45%)

“High-volume recruitment is becoming the norm across industries, yet many organizations struggle due to a lack of strategy and the right tools,” stated Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator and CEO of HR.com. “Those who invest in a well-defined approach and leverage effective technologies are far more successful in attracting and hiring quality candidates at scale.”

The full research report, HR.com’s State of High-volume and Hourly Hiring 2024, is available for free download and offers detailed insights and actionable recommendations for HR professionals looking to build more effective employee development initiatives.

The recording of the research webcast presentation, What’s Happening with High-Volume Hiring and Hourly Hiring in 2024?, is available for viewing 24/7 on demand.
