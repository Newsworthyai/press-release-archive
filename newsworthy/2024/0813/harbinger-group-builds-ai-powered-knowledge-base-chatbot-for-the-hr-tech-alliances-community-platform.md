# Harbinger Group Builds AI-Powered Knowledge Base Chatbot for the HR Tech Alliances Community Platform

Redmond, WA (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Aug 13, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Pacific — Harbinger Group, a global technology company that builds products and solutions to transform how people work and learn, has developed a transformative knowledge-based chatbot backed by AI. This chatbot is based on the foundation of advanced technologies and techniques like Open AI GPT-4, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM, and natural language queries.

The AI-based knowledge base chatbot was created for the HR Tech vendor community. This chatbot streamlines search via natural language queries. It successfully analyzes thousands of articles, including information about industry events, industry trends, HR product news, and press releases about M&A, funding, and executive job changes – all within HRTA’s knowledge base so the members can enjoy fast, easy, and accurate responses.

The AI-based knowledge base chatbot was designed and developed using the Harbinger iContent Framework, a content automation solution powered by Generative AI technologies. It helps HRTA auto-generate query responses faster and ensures easy search and retrieval of data from HRTA’s knowledge base.

AI-powered knowledge base chatbot offers quick access to the information and data sought by HR Tech vendors associated with HRTA. It increased the bandwidth to handle growing volumes of data and queries while enhancing the effectiveness of HRTA’s community platform and its resources. It enhances user engagement, experience, and satisfaction. Furthermore, it improves retention rates, operational efficiency, and business productivity.

“We are extremely honored to successfully create an AI-backed knowledge base chatbot for HRTA. This accomplishment showcases our focused commitment to delivering Advanced AI Solutions for HR based on the latest Generative AI models, Chatbot Development, API Integration, and Insightful Visualization. It also highlights Harbinger’s profound understanding of business nuances and deep AI expertise to help organizations create intelligent and scalable HR software products,” expressed Umesh Kanade, Vice President, Capability Development, Harbinger Group.

“Harbinger’s journey in HR Tech is rooted in our ability to tailor HR Tech solutions to address specific business challenges. Our innovative development of AI-based knowledge base chatbot for HRTA stands as a testament to our ongoing commitment to building long-term alliances with customers, partners, and vendors. We are deeply grateful to our esteemed clients, whose steadfast trust and collaboration have been instrumental in our success. We believe in delivering exceptional value and continuously evolving to meet the unique needs of our clients,” said Seema Chaudhary, Chief Alliance Officer, Harbinger Group.

“After years of dreaming about a natural language interface to our growing Knowledge Base, I’m thrilled to see that the future has arrived, and it is even better than I imagined. It’s now so much easier for our members to quickly get the answers they need to continue growing their business within the HR Tech ecosystem,” stated Ward Christman, Co-Founder, HR Tech Alliances.

We tried other chatbots in the past but were always disappointed – until Harbinger Group delivered their cutting-edge Chatbot, now our members are using it to become the smartest people in the industry! Harbinger Group is a fabulous solution partner, they know what it takes to deliver excellence, and do just that at very reasonable rates, and faster than all the others. While the Chatbot is open for public beta, you are invited to test it out on our home page at HRTechAlliances.com,” added Ward.
