# From Garage Startup to Award-Winning Agency: VMG Studios Celebrates 20 Years

Bellevue, WA (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Oct 11, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Pacific — VMG Studios, an Emmy Award-winning creative agency specializing in animation, design, video, and virtual production, proudly announces the celebration of its 20th anniversary.

Founded in 2004 by Kelly Sparks, VMG Studios has consistently pushed the boundaries of creativity and innovation. But the company's origin story is as inspiring as its rise to success.

This unexpected windfall became the seed money for VMG Studios, transforming a dream into reality.

"That moment was a turning point," said Kelly Sparks, Founder and CEO of VMG Studios. "It wasn’t just about the money—it was a symbol that even in our darkest moments, there can be a silver lining. That discovery fueled my entrepreneurial journey and laid the foundation for what VMG Studios has become today."

The company has earned a reputation for its ability to adapt to the rapidly evolving digital landscape while maintaining a strong commitment to storytelling and client collaboration.

"Reaching our 20th anniversary is a significant milestone," Sparks continued. "It’s a testament to our team's dedication, our clients' trust, and our relentless pursuit of creative excellence."
