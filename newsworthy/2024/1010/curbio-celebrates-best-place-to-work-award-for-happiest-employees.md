Curbio is modernizing the traditionally obstacle-ridden home improvement industry. By enabling sellers to pay for home updates and renovations at the closing table, financial barriers to getting a home ready to list have been removed for sellers.

Curbio promotes camaraderie with in-person events held twice a year for its remote workforce. Employees are brought together from across the country to connect, share ideas, and build relationships in these company-wide meetings, which are followed by fun evening activities which deepen ties within and across teams.

Curbio introduced spring and winter breaks to encourage employees to be fully present with their loved ones and recharge during holiday periods.
