# HR.com’s HR Research Institute Celebrates 8-Year Anniversary and Latest Productivity Achievements

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday May 21, 2024 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — This month, the HR Research Institute (HRRI) at HR.com celebrates its eighth anniversary as one of the most productive and celebrated human resources (HR) research institutes in the world.

“I’m super proud of what we’ve been able to achieve in less than a decade,” said HR.com’s CEO and Chief Instigator, Debbie McGrath. “I believe that few, if any, other organizations have produced as much quality and freely available HR research over the last 8 years. We consider it a great service to over 2 million members.”

McGrath noted that since 2016, HRRI has conducted over 225 individual research studies, each with a full report of findings and actionable takeaways, averaging more than 25 projects per year and 33 in 2023. During this period, the research team at HRRI has also published over 170 research infographics.

Much of HR.com’s research is guided by experts and industry thought leaders that comprise its various Advisory Boards. “HR.com is recognized as a leader in navigating the future of HR,” stated Advisory Board member Steve Rose, Director of Human Resources at Nevada County, California.

The HRRI focuses on a wide range of research topics, from the nitty gritty of diabetes management to the all-encompassing topics of AI applications in HR, employee experience, and talent acquisition. In addition, much of its research is longitudinal, covering many topics year on year to track trends over time.

One of the latest reports, HR.com’s Future of the HR Function 2024, can be downloaded by anyone who has an HR.com free membership. In addition, HR.com – which is well known for its professional education webcasts that provide SHRM and HRCI credits – has archives of recorded webcast sessions discussing all of its State of the Industry research findings.

All research reports and infographics with actionable strategies are available online:
