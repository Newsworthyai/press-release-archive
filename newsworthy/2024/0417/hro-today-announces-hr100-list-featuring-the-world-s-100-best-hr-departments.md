# HRO Today Announces HR100 list, Featuring the World's 100 Best HR Departments

Philadelphia, PA (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Apr 17, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Eastern — HRO Today Magazine, the premier media resource for leaders and executives in Human Resources management, has announced the 2023-24 HR100, a list of the world’s 100 best HR departments, based on a particular research methodology.

HRO Today has annually ranked HR service providers through Baker’s Dozen Customer Satisfaction Ratings™ for nearly two decades. Its research revealed that while there are many rankings of various aspects of HR, there isn’t one definitive source of which companies are the best for human resources. Enter HRO Today’s HR100.

HRO Today’s HR100 scores and ranks HR departments in eight core areas: workplace culture, employee benefits, diversity and inclusion, employee development and talent management, human resources innovation, leadership development, talent acquisition, and employer brand. Performance in these core categories is aggregated, forming an index that provides a reasonable score for overall HR excellence.

Methodology

To create the ranking, the HRO Today research team collected available public data from nearly 40 established benchmarking and ranking programs in the identified categories. This allows us to generate a score based equally on depth and breadth of outside recognition and internal recognition. The data is then aggregated and weighted to create the final score, producing the index used in the ranking.

The complete HR100 list can be found here.

HRO Today congratulates all 100 companies for their presence on the list, including the top 10:

1. Cisco Meraki

2. Bank of America

3. IBM

4. HubSpot

5. Alphabet Inc. (Google)

6. Capital One

7. Dell Technologies

8. Salesforce

9. Marriott International

10. Workday
