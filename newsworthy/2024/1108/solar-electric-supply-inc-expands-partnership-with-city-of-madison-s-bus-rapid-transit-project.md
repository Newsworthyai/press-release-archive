# Solar Electric Supply, Inc. Expands Partnership with City of Madison's Bus Rapid Transit Project

Scotts Valley, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Nov 8, 2024 @ 12:50 PM Pacific — Solar Electric Supply (SES), a leading provider of solar energy solutions, is proud to announce the expansion of its involvement in the City of Madison, Wisconsin's Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project. Building on its initial contribution of 36 SES ADU Tiny Home Solar Systems in 2023, SES has now provided an additional two systems, bringing the total to 38 solar installations.

This expansion, alongside SES's provision of additional components and technical support, strengthens the City of Madison's commitment to achieving net-zero energy use for its public transit infrastructure.

"We are excited to continue supporting Madison’s pioneering use of solar energy in public transportation," said Garrett Gettleman, CEO of Solar Electric Supply. "Our SES ADU Tiny Home Solar Systems are designed to deliver reliable, efficient, and sustainable energy solutions, and we are proud to contribute to the City of Madison's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint.” Each of the SES ADU Tiny Home GT-2.16-240GT systems is equipped with six REC 360NP2 high-efficiency solar panels, offsetting the lighting and other loads required by the bus stop shelters. These systems also include Enphase IQ8 microinverters for AC grid interconnection, mounted under each solar module and connected to a gateway communication system for remote monitoring. To meet the high snow loading requirements set by the Madison building department, SES utilized Ironridge racking for the solar installations.

SES collaborated with Walbec Group, a solar EPC firm delivering large and small construction projects throughout the Midwest since 1930, and Zenith Tech, a division of Walbec responsible for installing the shelters. The project aims to provide clean energy for the BRT system, which is set to open in late 2024 and will connect the East Towne and West Towne malls via a 15-mile route with more than 30 stations.

“When we were notified that the City of Madison would select the Solar alternate for their bus shelters, we had to quickly get from a basic design criteria, to a functional design with components,” said Mike Gerkhardt, Electrical Project Manager with Walbec Group. “We immediately reached out to Solar Electric Supply to start the process. They quickly produced drawing sets, material take-offs, and materials, for a complete solar installation. Within weeks, we went from rough guidelines, to full construction. Scott and his Team did an excellent job of getting us to where we could succeed wit the installation.”Metro Transit General Manager Justin Stuehrenberg praised the project, stating, "Madison's Rapid Route A will be the gold standard, not just for Madison but across the country." The project received a significant boost from a $110.6 million Federal Transit Administration grant, supporting the creation of the 15-mile route, more than 30 stations, and the purchase of 60-foot electric buses.

Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway emphasized the social impact of the project, highlighting that approximately 66% of Madison's low-income residents and almost 41% of its people of color will be within walking distance of BRT upon completion. "Rapid Route A will make it easier for folks to get across our community and vastly more efficient for our transit riders to get to their jobs, places of entertainment, and other community destinations," said Mayor Rhodes-Conway.
