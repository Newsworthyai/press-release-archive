# AlexiGen, Sensoria Health, Defender and Anderson Medical Supplies Announce Strategic Partnership to Create an Alternative to Amputation Diabetic

Anaheim, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Nov 8, 2024 @ 10:30 AM Pacific — At the DFCon Conference Symposium in Los Angeles, Anderson Medical Supplies, AlexiGen, Defender and Sensoria Health Inc. announced that they are joining forces on a groundbreaking partnership aimed at delivering the Alternative to Amputation: Footwear as a Service (FAAS): A Remote Patient Monitoring Artificial Intelligence Platform. The integrated solution was designed from the ground up to reduce the risk of amputation for patients suffering from diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). The companies will be sponsoring the symposium breakfast on Saturday, No. 9th from 7am to 8am with Dr. David Armstrong, Professor of Surgery at USC Keck School of Medicine as our chair.

This collaboration combines cutting-edge biologics with the newest remote patient monitoring technology, advanced wound care solutions, best of breed and clinically proven mechanical offloading footwear, and expert and compassionate clinical services to provide a more effective approach to DFU management that improves patients’ outcomes.

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a serious and chronic condition affecting millions of individuals within the diabetic population. According to the American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA), a leading authority on foot and ankle health, approximately 15% of people with diabetes will develop foot ulcers. Alarmingly, 6% of these individuals may require hospitalization due to infections or other complications related to their ulcers. The risks for diabetic patients are substantial, as DFUs are the leading cause of lower extremity amputations in the U.S. Studies indicate that between 14% and 24% of individuals with diabetes who develop foot ulcers will ultimately need an amputation.

Reducing amputation requires teamwork, innovation, and commitment to holistic patient care. This partnership brings together advanced technology, biologics, and clinical expertise to offer a more comprehensive solution for diabetic foot ulcer management—one that could fundamentally shift outcomes for those at risk.

As part of this partnership, Anderson Medical Supplies will offer dedicated patient monitoring clinical services, AlexiGen will offer its skin graft products, Defender and Sensoria will offer their Smart Boot and remote patient monitoring services.

The Defender smart boot, equipped with Sensoria Health’s innovative Sensoria Core and Smart Watch sensor and software technology, is being validated thanks to a new NIH R01 funded clinical study conducted by the University of Southern California (USC) Keck School of Medicine and Baylor College of Medicine. The system is already collecting remote patient data, and it demonstrates great promise.

It could become one of the most effective methods for quantifying and monitoring DFU patient adherence, activity and treating diabetic foot ulcers. By combining the best biologics and the best clinical services, the FAAS Platform could indeed reduce the risk of diabetic foot amputation.

“Reducing amputations requires a multidisciplinary effort. We joined forces and worked for many years to achieve this goal. Our new Footwear As A Service remote patient monitoring platform is available now. We are seeking visionary early adopters: clinicians, podiatry and wound care clinics and organizations that would like to join us in this new holistic approach to treating Diabetic foot ulcers.” Says Davide Vigano, CEO and cofounder of Sensoria Health Inc.

The Sensoria Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) mobile plus cloud software platform enables clinicians to track patients' adherence to physician-prescribed treatment plans in near real-time. This improved compliance ensures the optimal performance of AlexiGen’s skin substitute, significantly increasing the likelihood of positive outcomes for patients.
