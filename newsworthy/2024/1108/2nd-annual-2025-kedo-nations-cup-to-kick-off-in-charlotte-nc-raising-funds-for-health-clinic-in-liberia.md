# 2nd Annual 2025 KEDO Nations Cup to Kick Off in Charlotte, NC, Raising Funds for Health Clinic in Liberia

Coatesville, PA USA (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Nov 8, 2024 @ 7:00 AM US/Eastern — The 2nd Annual North Carolina KEDO Nations Cup, presented by Level Up Athletics & Performance, is set to take place in Charlotte over the weekend of August 15th or August 22nd, 2025. This summer tournament will bring together men’s soccer teams (ages 18-35) for a competitive, action-packed event that supports a critical cause: the construction of a health clinic in war-affected Sinoe County, Liberia.

This year’s tournament promises a high-energy atmosphere where players will not only compete for glory but also raise awareness and resources to help vulnerable communities in Southeastern Liberia. The 2025 KEDO Nations Cup aims to raise $10,000 to fund the ongoing construction of the clinic, a critical resource for improving healthcare in a region scarred by war and poverty.

Event Highlights:

* 2-Day Soccer Tournament: Open to men’s teams aged 18-35, featuring an 11v11 format.
* Minimum of 3 Games: Each team is guaranteed at least three matches, with knockout rounds on Sunday.
* Fundraising Goal: $10,000 to support the Kpalo-Bli health clinic construction.
* Team Registration: $900 per team, with a maximum roster of 24 players.
* Prizes: Trophy, medals, and a cash prize for the winning team.
* Location: To be determined in the Charlotte area.

In collaboration with Level Up Athletics and KEDO for Hope, the tournament emphasizes global health equity and community development through sport. As the second installment of this annual event, the 2025 KEDO Nations Cup builds on past achievements, including a newly built school and a student scholarship program in Liberia.

“The KEDO Nations Cup represents the power of sport to bring people together for a cause greater than winning. By playing in this tournament, athletes and supporters will help us complete a vital healthcare project that will change lives in Kpalo-Bli. Your involvement is more than a game; it’s a chance to contribute to the health and well-being of a community deeply in need.” - KEDO Board Member: Blamah Sarnor
