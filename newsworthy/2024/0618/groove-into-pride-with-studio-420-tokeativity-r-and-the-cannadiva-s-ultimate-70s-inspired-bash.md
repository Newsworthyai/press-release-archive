“Even though I didn’t know it, I’ve always been part of the LGBTQ+ community. My mom, who lived her life mostly hiding who she was from our family, was able to create a wonderful community around us that was full of love, support, and a lot of FUN!! This year's Studio 420, Throwback PRIDE Brunch, is more than just a party; it's a tribute to the strength and resilience of the LGBTQ+ community and a celebration of the progress we have made. So come and dance with us as we rejoice in the spirit of love and acceptance, and embrace our true selves with pride and joy."

- Tanya Osborne, Founder of The CannaDiva

"Marching proudly in the New York City Pride parade in 2006 was a transformative moment for me as a lesbian woman. It was the first time I waved that rainbow flag high, feeling unapologetically proud of who I am and the community I belong to. Pride isn't just about visibility; it's about celebrating our authenticity and honoring those who paved the way for us to live openly and authentically. We're excited for our event, paying homage to Studio 54 with an immersive experience where cannabis and LGBTQAI2+ pride intersect, celebrating in style and solidarity. We support spaces where freedom, expression, and inclusivity reign supreme."

- Lisa Snyder, Co-Founder of Tokeativity
