# Significant Skills Gaps in HR Function and Preparedness for Future - New Study by HR.com’s HR Research Institute

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Jun 18, 2024 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — A recent research study highlights the pressing need for human resources (HR) professionals to enhance their skills and proficiencies for effectively managing the workforce of the future. The findings reveal that only 30% of HR professionals rate their ability to meet workers' strategic needs highly (eight or above on a 10-point scale), underscoring a critical gap in the HR function.

In contrast, 43% give high ratings to their ability to meet the needs of their organizations’ executives, suggesting HR professionals are more highly aligned with senior management than with employees.

The full research report, HR.com’s Future of the HR Function 2024, is available for free download to provide critical insights and actionable strategies for HR professionals looking to improve their human capital management expertise and competency. This study examines current trends, challenges, and best practices to provide a comprehensive overview of how leading companies are successfully preparing their HR team for the future.

The findings identify key areas where HR must improve to better prepare for future challenges. The most significant skills gaps are found in:

* Strategic Thinking: While 93% of respondents consider it essential or important, only 54% believe HR is proficient or highly proficient in this area.
* Leveraging HR Data/Analytics: Despite 64% viewing it as essential or important, a mere 32% rate HR as proficient or highly proficient in using data and analytics effectively.

"HR professionals must evolve and adapt to meet the growing strategic needs of their organizations," stated Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator and CEO of HR.com. "Without significant improvements in these reported areas, HR will struggle to support and drive organizational success."

Further report insights and recommendations include a call for immediate action from HR leaders to bridge these gaps and ensure their teams are equipped with the necessary skills to navigate the complexities of the modern workforce. Investing in training and development, embracing innovative HR technologies, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement are critical steps towards achieving this goal.
