Working closely with HR.com’s HR Research Institute (HRRI), the newly-appointed talent acquisition advisory board will collaborate to positively influence the HR industry’s thought leadership and best practices through primary research.

The board of experts will guide senior HR professionals and help them understand and navigate today’s recruitment challenges and prepare for the future of hiring to ensure business success.

The findings will be published in a full report of insights and recommendations as well as a condensed two-page infographic.
