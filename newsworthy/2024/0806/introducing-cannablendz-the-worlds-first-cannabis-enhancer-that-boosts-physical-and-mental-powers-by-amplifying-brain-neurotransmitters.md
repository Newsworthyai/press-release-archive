# Introducing CannaBlendz: The World’s First Cannabis Enhancer That Boosts Physical and Mental Powers by Amplifying Brain Neurotransmitters

Menlo Park, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Aug 6, 2024 @ 8:55 AM Eastern — CannaBlendz is excited to announce the launch of its botanical supplements in New York. These natural, adaptogen-packed gummies can be used alone or paired with cannabis to enhance its effects naturally. Following a successful debut in Michigan, CannaBlendz now brings its benefits to New York, appealing to a wide range of consumers.

CannaBlendz patent-pending formulations are THC-free and contain adaptogenic plants and nootropics that reduce stress and drive positive flow states. Developed using network pharmacology principles, CannaBlendz targets the specific receptors in the central nervous system that drive focus, recovery, performance, and motivation. This boosts the ability of cannabis to provide elevated joy and body relief benefits.

Anandamide, a neurotransmitter of the endocannabinoid system, is termed the ‘bliss molecule’ since it drives pleasure enhancement and pain relief. Kevin Spelman, PhD lead formulator, explains, “We utilized advanced applied science to maximize the effects of the adaptogens and botanicals in CannaBlendz. By promoting a flow state and enhancing endocannabinoid tone, CannaBlendz helps you achieve your optimal physical and mental state, whether you seek focus, stamina, motivation, social ease, or physical and mental recovery.”

While CannaBlendz is beneficial if taken as a standalone supplement, CannaBlendz makes cannabis more effective by magnifying its powerful whole-body 'entourage' health effects. By addressing additional joy and relief receptors in the body, CannaBlendz creates an elevated experience, similar to adding aromatherapy and hot stones to a traditional massage.

Proven scientific CannaBlendz benefits include:

* Reduced social anxiety
* Boosted focus with less brain fog
* Improved recovery
* Increased motivation and stamina

CannaBlendz products deliver therapeutic levels of ashwagandha, ginseng, rhodiola, schisandra, corydalis, guarana, kanna, silymarin, yerba mate, 5-HTP, acetyl-L-carnitine, citicoline, and L-theanine.

Rave reviews are already coming in from cannabis consumers, everyday users, and athletes alike. According to Olympian Snowboarder, Jake Vedder, "As a professional athlete, a positive mental flow state and peak performance is my life, so I turn to CannaBlendz as my ride-or-die supplement. “

Alistaire Javier, Marketing Coordinator at Indoor Treez, shared his excitement, "CannaBlendz is THE companion product that doesn't step on anyone's toes. At Indoor Treez, we offer CannaBlendz as a supplement to all of our other products. Whether it be flower, carts, or edibles, you can never go wrong with completing your meal with CannaBlendz.”

CannaBlendz offers four formulations—MasterMind, Recovery, Performance, and Good Times—each priced with a retail value of $12. CannaBlendz products are available at various licensed dispensaries across NYC, see here.
