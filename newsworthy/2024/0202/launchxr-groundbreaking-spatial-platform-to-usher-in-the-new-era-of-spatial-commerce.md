# LaunchXR Groundbreaking Spatial Platform to Usher in the New Era of Spatial Commerce

New York, NY (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Feb 2, 2024 @ 6:00 AM Eastern — 

LaunchXR, a B2B software provider, has unveiled its spatial commerce platform for business, enabling retailers to respond to the rising interest for immersive, virtual brand experiences. With the debut of Apple’s Vision Pro headset bringing international focus to this new landscape of computing, the LaunchXR “spatial commerce platform” is set to revolutionize eCommerce-building, offering a no-code, AI-powered engine to create multi-dimensional, virtual sales environments and elevate customer experiences.

 

 As interest continues to build around lifelike, extended reality environments and experiences, companies are beginning to recognize spatial computing’s potential - yet struggle with accessible software platforms that allow them to tap into the promise of these next-generation capabilities.

 

 “Few turnkey solutions exist today for businesses to be able to easily bring to life imaginative online, immersive experiences that allow for direct customer fulfillment – We are proud to announce LaunchXR and believe it to be a pioneer in this new spatial landscape," said LaunchXR’s CEO Brady Beaubien. “The LaunchXR solution positions retailers to take real ownership of their presence and operational success in this new era of spatial commerce.”

 

 The platform allows retailers a flexible platform to construct customized 3D environments that contain interactive products and dynamic branded encounters. Its BusinessIQ analytics engine harnesses spatial data insights not available with traditional online channels to better assess the ROI’s of direct spatial engagement by customers.

 

 LaunchXR is now opening pilots for brands that desire innovative immersive experiences and wish to capitalize as early pioneers of the spatial commerce revolution.

 

 "LaunchXR's potential stretches beyond marketing, transforming commerce with innovative product launches and digital-first strategies, complemented by virtual concierge services and Generative AI. This AI integration elevates LaunchXR, offering unique, creative solutions for the business owner, commented Anthony Caiazzo, Managing Director of Programming.com. "With a significant investment in LaunchXR and Programming.Com as the primary technology partner, I am enthusiastic about the far-reaching potential of this innovative technology."
