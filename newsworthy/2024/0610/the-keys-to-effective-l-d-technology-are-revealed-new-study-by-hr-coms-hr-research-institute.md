# The Keys to Effective L&D Technology Are Revealed - New Study by HR.com’s HR Research Institute

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Jun 10, 2024 @ 9:40 AM Pacific — Organizations with high-quality learning and development (L&D) programs are over nine times more likely to have well-integrated learning technologies. This highlights the crucial role that integration often plays in the effectiveness of employee learning systems.

The complete research report, HR.com's Future of Learning Technologies 2024, is available for free download to provide critical insights and actionable strategies for human resources (HR) professionals looking to optimize their technology for employee development. The report explores the essential role of integration in the success of employee learning technologies and highlights key areas for improvement in L&D programs.

These findings also indicate significant room for improvement in both learning technologies and L&D programs. Only about half (49%) of HR professionals feel their learning technologies adequately prepare employees for their jobs, and a mere 39% report having a "top-notch culture of learning" within their organizations.

“This study highlights the critical need for companies to not only invest in learning technologies but also ensure these technologies are seamlessly integrated into their broader L&D strategies,” stated Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator and CEO of HR.com. “Integration is not just a technical challenge, it can be a strategic imperative for a lot of today’s employers.”

The full report, HR.com's Future of Learning Technologies 2024, is available for download and provides actionable strategies and key takeaways to help navigate the current trends regarding the application and integration of HR tech portfolios, for today and tomorrow.

The recording of the research presentation, How to Best Leverage Today’s Fast-Evolving Learning Technologies, is available for viewing 24/7 on demand.
