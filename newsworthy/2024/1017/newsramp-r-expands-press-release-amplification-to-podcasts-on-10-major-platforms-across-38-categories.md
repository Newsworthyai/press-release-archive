# NewsRamp® Expands Press Release Amplification to Podcasts on 10 Major Platforms Across 38 Categories

Boerne, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Oct 17, 2024 @ 9:30 AM Pacific — NewsRamp.com, a news marketing and syndication platform that transforms press releases into multimodal formats, has expanded its distribution network to include podcasting platforms, further enhancing the syndication and engagement of press release content from major newswires.

Addressing the Visibility Problem in News DistributionThe landscape of press release newswire distribution is facing unprecedented challenges. From evolving SEO algorithms to penalties for duplicate content, AI-driven search trends, and the rise of “Search and Answer,” traditional methods of reaching target audiences are shifting dramatically. As a result, many organizations are reevaluating their press release strategies.

NewsRamp provides a frontier technology solution to combat these visibility challenges. Press releases distributed through NewsRamp are not only published but also transformed into various content formats including news articles, blog posts, persona-based TLDR summaries, and innovative formats like Zero-Click Marketing. This content is then syndicated across NewsRamp’s proprietary distribution network, reaching websites, messaging channels, forums, newsletters, and social platforms.

Expanding Visibility through PodcastingWith the addition of podcasting platforms, NewsRamp.com further extends press release visibility and engagement beyond traditional search engines. This new initiative helps organizations reach their target audiences where they are most active.

"We recognize that newswires may not have the resources or technical expertise to keep pace with advancements in AI and large language models," explains David McInnis, founder of NewsRamp.com and PRWeb. "With NewsRamp.com, newswires gain access to a team continuously developing pioneering solutions for news distribution, seamlessly integrated through our API at a small fixed price per release."

NewsRamp.com now curates press releases into comprehensive audio summaries across 38 categories, distributing these podcast episodes to major platforms including Apple, Spotify, YouTube, Android, Blubrry, iHeart Radio, Pandora, Castbox, Podcasts Index, and Deezer.

"Most internet activity happens outside of search," added Mark M. Willaman, co-founder of NewsRamp. "It’s essential for press releases to be present on alternative platforms. By distributing releases in multiple formats, NewsRamp ensures that news surfaces organically across search engines and platforms where audiences spend their time - such as podcasting platforms."

Ward Christman, Ecosystem Navigator of the HR Tech Alliances and sponsor of NewsRamp’s Human Resources podcast channel remarked: “NewsRamp has made it effortless for us to expand the reach of our press releases. By turning them into podcasts, we’re able to engage a wider audience who prefer to consume content in audio form. This innovative approach is exactly what the newswire industry needs to remain relevant in a rapidly changing digital landscape.”
