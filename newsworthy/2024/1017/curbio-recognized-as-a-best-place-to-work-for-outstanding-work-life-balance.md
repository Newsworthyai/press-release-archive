# Curbio Recognized as a Best Place to Work for Outstanding Work-Life Balance

Potomac, MD (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Oct 17, 2024 @ 12:25 PM Eastern — Curbio, the leading pre-listing home improvement company, is proud to announce that it has been awarded the Comparably Best Place to Work award for Best Work-Life Balance. This recognition by Comparably, a leading workplace culture and corporate brand reputation platform, highlights Curbio's commitment to fostering a flexible and supportive work environment that prioritizes employee well-being and productivity.

Since its founding in 2017, Curbio has established a nationwide presence, becoming the go-to contractor for thousands of real estate agents preparing their clients' homes for sale with its turnkey, pay-at-close model. This modern, full-service approach removes the financial barrier from sellers as well as offloads project management accountability from agents to help them focus on winning listings and growing their businesses.

While headquartered in the D.C. metro area with a physical office available for team members who choose to use it, Curbio firmly believes that a work-from-anywhere approach is one of the keys to employee happiness and performance, as well as the modern way to attract the best talent from across the country.

"Our remote work environment not only boosts employee productivity but also allows us to hire A+ talent from anywhere in the United States,” said Rick Rudman, CEO of Curbio. “While many companies across industries are announcing plans to return to the office due to decreased productivity, we will continue to foster a culture of trust and flexibility that fuels work-life balance for all. Our employees’ results have continuously proven that they are focused on our mission to transform the pre-listing home improvement industry and are dedicated to the success of our company.”

Curbio's commitment to work-life balance is also evident in its impressive benefits package, including 100% healthcare coverage for employees with coverage for their families, paid parental leave, 401(k) match, stock options, unlimited PTO, and more. This suite of benefits reflects the importance Curbio places on its team members and their impact to the company, as well as the respect the organization has for its employees in their personal lives as well.

Kelly Morrisette, a Senior Home Improvement Consultant who has been with Curbio for three years, shared her thoughts on the company culture: "With nearly two decades in the remodeling industry, I can confidently say this is the best company I've worked for. The remote work culture gives me the flexibility I need to balance my personal and professional life seamlessly. Curbio values me not only as an employee, but as a person. I work hard and deliver excellent service to my clients. Curbio rewards me by giving me the freedom to work wherever I choose, take my vacation time, be there for my family, and use personal time to ensure my responsibilities are taken care of. The support from leadership and the superior benefits set Curbio apart.”
