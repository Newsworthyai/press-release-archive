# Golf Legend Annika Sörenstam Drives Official Opening Of Hunters Run Country Club’s Newly Renovated South Driving Range

Boynton Beach, FL (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Mar 27, 2024 @ 9:15 AM Pacific — Golf icon Annika Sörenstam gracefully stepped onto the steps of the Clubhouse, poised to unleash one of her trademark drives straight down the center of the driving range. But, due to the inclement weather last Friday, this wouldn't happen. It didn't stop her from verbally proclaiming, under cover of the hitting stations, the grand opening of Hunters Run Country Club's revamped driving range, a pivotal feature of the Club's dynamic "Progress in Motion" initiative aimed at redeveloping its facilities. With all its enhancements, Hunters Run was named a Top 50 Private Club Driving Range by the Golf Range Association of America (GRAA).

The South Driving Range at Hunters Run now boasts 17 covered hitting stations and three cutting-edge studios featuring synthetic turf mats. Each station is outfitted with state-of-the-art Toptracer touchscreen monitors and towers, meticulously tracking the trajectory of every shot with precision, from speed and curve to launch angle and distance. Callaway brings this technology to Hunters Run, revolutionizing golf practice and play by offering instant feedback on performance. Players can also enjoy gaming modes individually or with friends.

Alongside the technological upgrades, the Club’s freshly renovated range showcases synthetic bunkers, strategic short-game targets, and advanced robotic systems for ball retrieval and maintenance, freeing up employees to better service the membership. An automatic ball washing system, the first of its kind in the United States, has also been added.

Ben Bauer, PGA, Director of Golf at Hunters Run, who was instrumental in bringing Toptracer to Hunters Run, expressed gratitude to Annika Sörenstam for her involvement in the milestone event, emphasizing the Club's commitment to elevating the golfing experience. "With the introduction of Toptracer, we're setting a new standard for excellence in range facilities. It's a win-win for Clubs and players alike, fostering a passion for the game and fostering continuous improvement."

The Toptracer system seamlessly integrates with smartphones via a dedicated app. The app provides golfers with real-time data on their shots, enabling progress tracking and performance measurement.

Larry Savvides, Hunters Run's Chief Operating Officer and General Manager, emphasized the Club's commitment to providing unmatched amenities while fostering social opportunities. "Our three distinctive 18-hole championship golf courses have always been a standout feature. The integration of Toptracer takes golf at Hunters Run to new heights. This advancement empowers our golf professionals to optimize our members' skills, elevating their potential. By modernizing the practice experience, we solidify Hunters Run's status as a leading private club in Florida."
