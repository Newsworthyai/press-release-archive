# Employee Well-being Initiatives Are Common Now, But Few Are Having Great Success - New Study by HR.com’s HR Research Institute

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Jul 23, 2024 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — HR.com’s HR Research Institute has released new research findings revealing that almost one-third (30%) of HR professionals believe their employee well-being programs are effective. While many organizations are striving to enhance well-being, the research indicates there is still significant room for growth.

Further, more than 8 in 10 organizations grapple with a variety of mental-health-related issues, the most common being stress (88%) and anxiety (81%).

The research also sheds light on factors contributing to negative stress for employees. The top causes of stress identified are:

* Workload: 66%
* Work/life balance: 53%
* Financial stress: 44%

These stressors highlight the critical areas where HR professionals can focus their efforts to alleviate employee stress and enhance overall well-being.

The study shows that a majority of organizations are actively working to increase various types of well-being through specific initiatives:

* Physical well-being: 87%
* Mental/emotional well-being: 75%
* Work environment well-being: 61%
* Social well-being: 58%
* Financial: 57%

Despite these efforts, just 27% say their initiatives are well-integrated. Further analysis highlights the finding that organizations that have been more successful in implementing well-being programs are nearly nine times more likely to report having a holistic approach to well-being.

“The results from this study underscore the fact that well-being initiatives aren’t as effective as they should be right now,” stated Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator and CEO of HR.com. “There's a clear need for more effective and cohesive strategies.”

The full research report, HR.com’s Future of Employee Well-Being 2024, is available for free download and offers detailed insights and actionable recommendations for HR professionals looking to optimize their wellness programs and create a healthier, more supportive work environment. By addressing these key areas, organizations can improve employee satisfaction, engagement, and productivity.
