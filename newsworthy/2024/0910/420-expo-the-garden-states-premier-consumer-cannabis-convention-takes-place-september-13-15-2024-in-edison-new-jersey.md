Edison, NJ (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Sep 10, 2024 @ 8:00 AM Eastern — The third annual 420 Expo returns to the New Jersey Convention and Exposition Center, September 13-15, 2024, presented by Wakit Grinders (https://wakitgrinders.com). The B.Y.O.C. (bring your own cannabis) public event series in Edison is to bring together an expected attendance of more than 15,000 cannabis enthusiasts over the age of 21 for three days of special entertainment, celebrity guest appearances, seminars and panel discussions, contests, food trucks, live music, performances, immersive experiences and giveaways, along with a variety of vendors from New Jersey and across the country. Purchase tickets now for general admission, VIP access, and bucket list smoke sessions at https://420expo.com/tickets.

“We are excited to close out the official summer season by celebrating all things cannabis at the fastest growing consumer cannabis event in the Northeast,” says J. Handy, Director and co-creator of the 420 Expo. “Whether they’re a canna-connoisseur or canna-curious about the benefits of the plant, all attendees will have the opportunity to learn more about the booming industry with a full slate of programming and discussions with vendors from all cannabis sectors. Attendees will also witness the results of the 420 Expo Cannabis Cup, a first-of-its-kind statewide compliant competition.”

The 420 Expo Cannabis Cup, produced by High End Events, has been a successful precursor to the three-day 420 Expo where cannabis enthusiasts over the age 21, purchased kits to judge in the following categories: Indica, Sativa, Hybrid, Non-Infused Prerolls, Infused Prerolls, and Cartridges. Each Judge’s Kit include a free ticket to the 420 Expo along with premium cannabis products, carefully selected for their quality and craftsmanship to showcase the best that New Jersey’s cultivation community has to offer. Cannabis consumers throughout the Garden State can still pick up limited-edition Judge’s Kits from statewide licensed cultivators for the first-of-its-kind “420 Expo Cannabis Cup” (https://420expocup.com/) at participating dispensaries NJ Leaf and HoneyGrove until September 11, 2024 at 4:20 p.m.

“This event is not just a significant milestone for our dispensary, but it’s a landmark moment for the entire state,” says Alisson Jensen, VP of Operations, Sales and Marketing at NJ Leaf. “It’s an opportunity for cultivators to showcase their finest cannabis strains and products.” “And what’s really exciting,” adds General Manager Luke Lieberman, “is seeing that new, smaller brands are competing against some that have been in the state for a while - and that consumers have a direct say in what is standing out in New Jersey’s rapidly growing cannabis industry.”

NJ Leaf is located at 546 Park Ave, Freehold, NJ 07728 (Website). HoneyGrove is located at 1337 Blackwood Clementon Rd, Clementon, NJ 08021 (Website)

“HoneyGrove is deeply proud to be one of only two locations in the entire state where people can purchase the exclusive 420 Expo Cup judging kits. These kits are your ticket to being a part of history,” says Jeffrey Miller, CEO of HoneyGrove Dispensary. HoneyGrove’s Chief Cannabis Officer and legacy operator Big Dave added, “It has been an honor to collaborate with Bobby Nuggz to organize this trailblazing first cup in the state. We have worked relentlessly to get the best brands to participate, to bring attention to new and independent cultivators, to offer the people a platform to make their voice heard, and, most importantly, to raise the bar for legal cannabis in the Garden State.”

As part of the celebration of the inaugural 420 Expo Cannabis Cup, the 420 Expo also announced that on the opening night of the show, September 13, it will be BFF: Budtender Free Friday. For the entire evening budtenders (and industry employees) who present their valid NJ-CRC employee identification cards will receive free general admission to the expo.

The 420 Expo, which many call the “Ultimate Smoke Sesh,” will be open to the public Friday, September 13, from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m.; Saturday, September 14, from 12 p.m. to 9 p.m.; and Sunday, September 15, from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m. The 420 Expo will also feature an exhibition hall with around 100 cannabis-friendly vendors, including dispensaries, cultivators, CBD businesses, accessories, and beverages, clothing and apparel, jewelry, art, along with direct access to nonprofits and advocacy groups, legal advice for record expungements, cannabis industry employment opportunities, and much more. Guests also can enjoy a massive outdoor consumption area with music, experiences and numerous curated food trucks.

One of the celebrities scheduled to appear, Vincent Pastore, best known for his role on the iconic HBO show “The Sopranos,” will be onsite to mix and mingle, take photos and get autographs during the three-day experience. Other notable guest appearances also include everyone’s favorite Quick Stop and Mooby guy from the movie “Clerks,” Brian O’Halloran, former WWE champion and UFC standout, the “Super King of Bros,” Matt Riddle, director and reality tv guest Danny Provenzano, “Real Housewives of Jersey” personality, Frank Catania, Sr., along with other surprise cannabis industry and entertainment influencers.

“Alongside the Three Expo Events team, we have curated over 30 interactive seminars open to all attendees that focus on topics such as choosing the right strains, networking in cannabis, legal expungement, cannabis to help medical issues as well as addiction and recovery, cooking with cannabis, social equity, and travel, among others,” says Bobby Nuggz of High End Events.
