# The Illusion of Effective DEIB Initiatives May Be Hiding Some Surprising Gaps - New Study by HR.com’s HR Research Institute

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Jul 8, 2024 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — A recent research study by HR.com’s HR Research Institute highlights significant gaps in Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (DEIB) initiatives within organizations, revealing that only 28% of DEIB programs have reached an advanced or expert level of maturity.

The research report, HR.com’s Future of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging 2024, is available for free download and provides actionable takeaways and tips for HR professionals looking to improve the effectiveness of their DEIB programs.

The research reveals significant disparities between organizations with mature DEIB programs and those still developing. Organizations with more effective DEIB initiatives tend to prioritize education and training, being eight times more likely to have DEIB-focused learning and development programs compared to organizations with less effective diversity and inclusion programs.

Further analysis highlights the finding that just one-fifth of organizations reported having no DEIB-related L&D programs at all, while only about two-fifths (42%) offer these programs to all employees. This lack of educational initiatives can be a significant barrier to achieving advanced diversity and inclusion program maturity.

“Education and training are critical components in the journey toward effective DEIB programs," stated Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator and CEO of HR.com. “The findings show that companies struggling with DEIB effectiveness often neglect these aspects. A strong focus on DEIB-related learning and development can bridge these gaps and promote a more inclusive workplace culture.”

Another area for improvement identified in the study is the measurement of DEIB metrics. The majority of companies are tracking some basic demographics related to diversity, but less than half of the organizations are currently tracking more advanced metrics such as pay equity data, employee retention, recruiting outcomes, and diversity within leadership ranks. The absence of robust metrics makes it challenging for organizations to assess and enhance the effectiveness of their DEIB initiatives.

The full report, HR.com’s Future of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging 2024, is available for download and provides more detail and additional tips to help elevate DEIB initiatives and create a more equitable and inclusive work environment.

The recording of the research presentation, Demonstrating the Benefits of Great DEIB Initiatives, is available for viewing 24/7 on demand.
