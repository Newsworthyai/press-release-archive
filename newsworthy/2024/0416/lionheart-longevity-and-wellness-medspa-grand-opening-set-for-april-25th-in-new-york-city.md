# Lionheart Longevity and Wellness MedSpa Grand Opening Set for April 25th, in New York City

Mission Viejo, California (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Apr 16, 2024 @ 12:45 PM Mountain — In a move to redefine the longevity and aesthetics industry and position Lionheart Health as the premier medical spa network in the world, the company today announced the grand opening on April 25, 2024, of a flagship location in New York City at 240 W 37th Street 5th floor near Penn Station.

Lionheart Longevity and Wellness Medspas will offer a combination of the company’s proprietary bioelectric and biologic products for skin and hair regeneration as well as body toning and sculpting, joint/knee health, sexual health, bladder health, and healthspan optimization. The company’s proprietary products employ gentle bioelectric stimulation sequences and biologic compositions to engage the body's natural healing processes to regenerate and repair itself.

At the center of Lionheart's technology platform is increasing Klotho protein levels in the body, using a patented technology platform that has produced scientifically proven results in medically supervised clinical studies.

"At our medspa clinics, our goal is to utilize the power of safe and effective regenerative aesthetics technologies for skin, hair, body toning procedures and to introduce our patented healthspan optimization programs." said Howard J. Leonhardt, Lead Inventor, Executive Chairman & CEO of Lionheart Health, Inc. "Opening a flagship location in New York City is a dream come true for our team that has worked so hard for so many years developing these unique technologies."

Lionheart Health's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Leslie Miller, commented, "We're not just launching another medspa; we're introducing innovative aesthetic and wellness services unavailable elsewhere. At the center of our patented regenerative technology is the ability to precisely control protein expressions to repair and reset cellular functions, including the Klotho protein."

Klotho is an anti-aging protein predominantly produced in muscles and the kidney. Klotho’s benefits to the body have been widely studied and increasingly identified as a key to suppressing or even reversing many effects of aging. “Circulating levels of soluble Klotho decrease with age,” Miller said. “This decline in Klotho gene expression is associated with an increased risk of age-related diseases.”

In addition to its patented bioelectric-enhanced treatments, Lionheart Health’s Longevity and Wellness MedSpas will offer conventional medspa services, including injectables, skin rejuvenation, lasers, microneedling and body toning, and robust client support designed to ensure each visit receives exceptional, personalized care.

Lionheart Health won the most recent AbbVie Allergan Aesthetics ULP Golden Passport Competition for Innovations in Medical Aesthetics, and is a contestant in the $101 million-dollar XPRIZE Competition for Healthspan Extension.
