# Clean Habits Launches in North America with Revolutionary Cleaning Products

Houston, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Jun 5, 2024 @ 6:30 AM US/Central — Clean Habits, a leading-edge cleaning products company, is excited to announce its official launch in North America, bringing a new level of cleanliness and safety to homes across the continent.

With a mission to "clean the heck out of almost every surface in your house," Clean Habits uses non-toxic ingredients to eliminate bacteria for up to five days. Leveraging the patented Synbio technology, the products combine nature and science through synbiotics—a first-ever blend of prebiotics and probiotics. Probiotics defeat germs while prebiotics feed them, ensuring long-lasting protection for up to five days.

"We're thrilled to introduce Synbio Technology to North America," said Kristy Phillips, Founder and Managing Partner of Synbio Concept. "Our products offer a deeper, longer-lasting clean that promotes a safer, healthier environment for families and pets. Cleaning should be a positive experience, not a toxic one."

Clean Habits aims to redefine cleanliness using proven biology instead of harsh chemicals. The initial product lineup includes multi-purpose sprays, kitchen and bathroom cleaners, pet stain removers, drain cleaners, laundry detergents, and floor cleaners. Each product offers lasting, bacteria-reducing cleaning power while being gentle on surfaces and the environment.

Backed by a 5-Day Clean Promise, Clean Habits guarantees its products will continue to clean and protect surfaces for up to five days after application where most become inactive after 30 minutes.

"We're not just launching a cleaning line – we're starting a movement," added Kristy. "Everyone deserves a cleaner, healthier, and happier life, and we're committed to making that a reality at home, work, and beyond."

Clean Habits products are now available online and will soon be in major retailers across North America.
