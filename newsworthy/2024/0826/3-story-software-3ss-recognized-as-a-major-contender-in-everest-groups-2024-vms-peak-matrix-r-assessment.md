# 3 Story Software (3SS) Recognized as a ‘Major Contender’ in Everest Group’s 2024 VMS PEAK Matrix® Assessment.

New Milford, CT (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Aug 26, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Eastern — 3 Story Software (3SS), a leader in contingent workforce management solutions, is pleased to announce its recognition as a ‘Major Contender’ in Everest Group’s Global 2024 Vendor Management System (VMS) PEAK Matrix® Assessment.

Everest Group’s report utilizes their proprietary PEAK Matrix® framework to assess the capabilities of 22 VMS providers across two critical dimensions: market impact and vision and capability. The analysis is designed to guide buyers in selecting the most appropriate service provider for their needs, while also providing vendors with insights into their competitive standing.

The PEAK Matrix® is an essential resource for understanding the current state and future growth prospects of the VMS industry. This framework evaluates the market impact of participants by analyzing their market adoption, the breadth of their services, and the value delivered to clients. Additionally, Everest Group examines each provider’s technological innovation, unique strengths, client support, and strategic approach.

Over the past year, the staffing industry has experienced a contraction on a global scale, a trend consistent with historical patterns during periods of even low to moderate economic instability and inflation. “During times like this, it is especially important to have access and visibility to all of your contingent labor spend, whether it is in a single building or across multiple countries. 3SS is the SaaS application needed to manage all of your indirect labor needs,” John Moore, Director of Client Solutions for 3 Story Software.

As the industry adapts to these challenging conditions, it underscores the importance of robust, adaptable solutions like those offered by 3 Story Software. Our understanding of these market dynamics has been integral in shaping our roadmap strategy and feature requests from our MSP partners.

Joseph Marsh, Senior Vice President of 3 Story Software, commented “At 3 Story Software, our commitment to innovation and delivering enterprise-class solutions remains unwavering.”
