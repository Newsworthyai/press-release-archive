# KW Offerings Selects Curbio as Its Exclusive Home Improvement Partner for Keller Williams Agents

Potomac, MD (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Oct 15, 2024 @ 11:00 AM Eastern — Curbio, the leading pre-listing home improvement company for real estate agents and their clients, is proud to announce its partnership with KW Offerings, a nationwide platform that provides competitive home selling options to Keller Williams agents. Curbio is exclusively powering ‘Upgrade & Sell,’ KW Offering’s pre-listing concierge program. Curbio was selected for its expertise as the only pre-listing national general contractor, its fix first, pay-at-close model, and its turnkey solution that offloads project management accountability from agents to help them focus on winning listings and growing their businesses.

“By selecting Curbio as the exclusive partner powering Upgrade & Sell, KW Offerings is signaling to the industry that for Keller Williams agents to compete more effectively in today’s dynamic real estate market, they must provide sellers with a simplified pre-listing renovation solution as part of their value proposition,” said Rick Rudman, CEO of Curbio. “Our modern, full-service, and technology driven model uniquely positions us to support KW Offerings—and the real estate industry—as the agent’s go-to general contractor.”

Curbio offers agents consistency in pricing, process and service across projects of any size and scope. Curbio uses technology and a dedicated team of expert consultants to streamline providing estimates and proposals, saving agents days of effort tracking down estimates. Curbio removes the traditional burdens of the home improvement process with guaranteed compliance on licensing, insurance and permits, as well as timely delivery of ready-to-ship materials with broad buyer appeal.

Curbio delivers quality workmanship from a nationwide network of licensed, professional contractors, which helps agents and sellers enjoy a stress-free experience. Throughout the project, Curbio’s app offers agents and sellers instant communication and complete visibility into the project through updates sent directly to their phones. Curbio has distinguished itself in the real estate industry with the expertise, resources and commitment to offer speed and quality from proposal to project completion.

“Pre-listing home improvement is transforming the real estate industry,” remarked Jason Wells, co-founder of KW Offerings and top-producing agent with over $1 billion in real estate transactions. “Curbio has positioned itself as smart choice for agents, because they use technology and expertise to handle the complexities of providing estimates and proposals, vetting contractors, and managing the project, which historically fell on real estate agents. Curbio is a game-changer for agents who want to compete more effectively, win more listings and provide better service to their clients.”

"KW Offerings is committed to equipping our members with the best tools to serve their clients and grow their business. Partnering with Curbio allows us to offer a trusted, efficient, nationwide solution for pre-listing home upgrades, making it easier for agents to deliver on their promise of a successful home sale," said Tim Evans, co-founder of KW Offerings and 25-year Keller Williams Veteran and Team Leader. “Curbio provides our members with the power to further differentiate themselves in their markets and get strong sales outcomes for their clients.”
