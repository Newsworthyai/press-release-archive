# GVTC Foundation and The Building Texas Show Highlight Cooperative Impact in Texas: A Call to Grow Round-Up Program Participation

Boerne, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Sep 24, 2024 @ 7:00 AM US/Central — The latest episode of The Building Texas Show features Sonia Aguillon, President of the GVTC Foundation, discussing the powerful role cooperatives like GVTC play in fostering economic development, education, quality of life, and innovation across rural Texas. With over 50,000 customers, GVTC continues to support its community through unmatched giving initiatives, like the 100% matching programs that multiply the impact of every donation.

Cooperatives differ from investor-owned utilities, as they are owned by the members they serve. For GVTC, this means not only providing reliable high-speed internet and telecommunications services but also investing back into the community through its nonprofit arm, the GVTC Foundation. Since its inception in 2006, the Foundation has helped strengthen the lives of Central Texas residents by contributing to critical programs in 11 counties.

A Call to Action for GVTC Members and Customers

One of GVTC Foundation’s most successful initiatives is the Round-Up for Change program, which allows customers to round up their bills to the nearest dollar, with 100% of those funds matched by GVTC. This simple act has already raised over $50,000, providing essential resources for families, seniors, and nonprofits across the region. However, with only 12% of GVTC customers currently participating, there is immense potential to increase this impact.

“Imagine if we could double that percentage,” Aguillon said in the interview. “The growth opportunity for our community would be transformational.”

The GVTC Foundation invites all GVTC members and customers to join this impactful program by enrolling in Round-Up for Change. The process is easy—customers can sign up through their GVTC account or by calling the customer service line. Every contribution, no matter how small, can make a significant difference, especially when matched.

How to Get Involved

GVTC members can sign up for the Round-Up for Change program online through their account or by calling 830-885-8450. With each dollar rounded up, matched by GVTC, your contribution helps fund programs in education, healthcare, and local nonprofits that enhance the quality of life for residents across Central Texas.
