# Iotech International Launches ioRinse™MR: A Revolutionary Oral Rinse Providing Profound Relief For Cancer Patients Facing Oral Side Effects

Boynton Beach, FL (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Nov 21, 2024 @ 7:00 AM Eastern — ioTech International announces the release of ioRinse™ MR, an advanced oral rinse developed specifically to provide substantial relief for cancer patients suffering from mouth sores, dry mouth, oral pain, and ulcers—debilitating side effects often resulting from chemotherapy and radiation. These symptoms are common effects of chemotherapy and radiation that affect quality of life, overall comfort, and impose a significant cost burden.

Leveraging ioTech’s proprietary molecular iodine technology, ioRinse™ MR offers a pleasant taste and provides immediate, lasting relief without causing tooth staining.

Transformative Relief from Cancer Treatment Side Effects“Chemotherapy and radiation therapy can cause painful mouth and throat ulcers so severe that eating, drinking, and speaking become incredibly difficult, often necessitating feeding tubes,” explained Dr. Herb Moskowitz, Chairman of ioTech International. “ioRinse™ MR provides a major benefit by supporting healing and providing instant relief while rapidly mitigating the severity and duration of these oral mucositis symptoms, enabling patients to resume their daily activities.”

As the latest addition to ioTech International’s line of specialized oral care solutions, ioRinse™ MR exemplifies the company’s dedication to addressing complex oral health challenges.

“We’re thrilled to offer ioRinse™ MR to support the well-being of cancer patients,” said Dr. Moskowitz. “ioRinse™ MR stands for Maximum Relief, aptly named for its breakthrough effectiveness in managing the painful side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. This product underscores our commitment to enhancing the quality of life for those who need it most.”The ioTech International Chairman points to the dramatic results seen by oncologists and dentists who have recommended ioRinse™ MR to their patients suffering from mouth sores, lesions, oral pain, and ulcers. “Typically, patients find ioRinse™ MR more effective and faster acting than any other product they’ve tried,” Dr. Moskowitz shared.

Close to home, Jackie Strauss, ioTech’s head of customer service, office manager, and breast cancer survivor, is a living testament to ioRinse™ MR as an early adopter of the beta product. She was hospitalized with oral mucositis during cancer treatment and could not eat solid foods due to horrible mouth lesions. With the help of ioRinse™ MR, she received instant relief and was out of the hospital, symptom-free within a few days,” said Dr. Moskowitz.

Among the benefits of ioRinse™MR are the following:* Safe and easy to use
* Efficacy has been tested and proven effective in providing substantial relief from mouth sores, dry mouth, oral pain, and ulcers
* Does not cause microbial resistance
* Non-staining, pleasant-tasting formulation
* Cost-effective preventative care
* Long-lasting breath freshener

In conjunction with the market launch of ioRinse™ MR, ioTech International is currently enrolling a limited number of oncology offices to provide a free starter supply of ioRinse™ MR to oncology patients beginning active therapy. More information about this program is available from ioTech International.
