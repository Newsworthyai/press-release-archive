Modesto, California (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Jan 16, 2024 @ 11:50 AM Pacific — Prophet Brands, the California industry’s most anticipated premium legacy brand— inspired by the highly publicized federal cannabis trial of Luke Scarmazzo and Ricardo Montes v. US Government— is excited to make its debut at the seven Premier Group dispensary retail locations throughout California on Friday, January 19th, 2024.

With cannabis consumption at an all-time high, fueled by high THC indoor flower, rechargeable vape pens, and convenient prerolls, the legal cannabis industry is the fastest-growing sector in the country.

This brand launch will accelerate growth while making an impact on lives of those still incarcerated behind a nonviolent cannabis offense.

Partnerships like these are the future of this industry.”
