Today the company announced the expansion of its klotho therapy products portfolio with the unveiling of both Klotho Patch™ and Klotho Pod™.

"Klotho Patch™ and Klotho Pod™ are important additions to Lionheart Health's expanding product and platform portfolio that we hope in the future will empower MedSpa and Sport Medicine professionals to better help their patients reach their healthspan, aesthetics, and sports injury recovery goals," said Howard J. Leonhardt, inventor and Executive Chairman & CEO of Lionheart Health, Inc. "These easy to use ready to go on the go wearable solutions may in the future be a preferred alternative for those seeking a convenient way to increase their local and circulating klotho levels"

Over 3,750 Papers Published on Klotho

Since its discovery in 1997 - 3,759 scientific and clinical papers have been published on klotho. The clear conclusion of this body of work is that if you are low in circulating Klotho you are aging more rapidly and are more likely to encounter aging-related ailments including death earlier than your expected time.

Klotho Patch™ and Klotho Pod™ have been designed to match user expectations and experiences with well-known familiar patch and pod products already on the market in widespread use. In addition to their compact, comfortable, and convenient form factors, Klotho Patch™ and Klotho Pod™ both feature flexible designs with customizable dosing as well as app-based easy-to-adjust dosing capabilities.

Sample devices are available to support technical evaluation and human factors studies, with clinical devices scheduled for the end of 2024 after extensive pre-clinical testing has been fully completed.
