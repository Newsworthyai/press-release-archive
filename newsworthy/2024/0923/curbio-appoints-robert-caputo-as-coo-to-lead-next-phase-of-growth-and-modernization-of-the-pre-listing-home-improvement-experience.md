His experience also includes a leadership role at Katerra, one of the fastest-growing construction technology startups, where he served as Vice President of People and Systems and Head of Katerra Multi-Family Platforms.

“I am honored to step into the role of COO at such a dynamic and forward-thinking company,” said Caputo. “Curbio’s streamlined, technology-driven approach has removed the financial and operational obstacles for agents and sellers that the home improvement industry has historically faced. I look forward to leading the dedicated, experienced Curbio operations team as we continue to scale and deliver unmatched value to agents and their clients.”
