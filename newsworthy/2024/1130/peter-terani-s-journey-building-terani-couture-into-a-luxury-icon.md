# Peter Terani's Journey: Building Terani Couture Into a Luxury Icon

Los Angeles, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Saturday Nov 30, 2024 @ 7:00 AM UTC — Peter Terani, the visionary behind Terani Couture, believes that “every woman deserves to have luxury within an arm’s reach. Terani helps women dress according to their body type and promotes a body-confidence message.”

The journey of Terani Couture began with the brand’s focus on creating designer suits for plus-size women. However, after recognizing the growing interest from mid-sized women in these custom designs, Terani expanded its offerings to cater to a broader customer base.

“We decided to bring the best fashion trends to women of all body types and demographics,” Peter explains. “This forward-thinking philosophy enhances the wearer’s natural beauty while enabling her to enter a room feeling beautiful and confident.”Terani Couture’s story took off in 1998 when the brand introduced evening couture and incorporated hand-beaded glass crystals into its designs.

In an interview with Cloudways Ecommerce Superstars series, Peter shares, “These dresses took around three months to be made just because of the inclusion of beaded crystals.”

This commitment to craftsmanship fueled the brand’s remarkable growth throughout the 2000s, leading to the opening of physical and virtual stores in the United States.

Today, Terani Couture is available in renowned stores like Bloomingdale’s, Dillard’s, Lord & Taylor, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue in Dubai, Kleinfeld Bridal, Monique Lhuillier, and BG Haute Couture. Internationally, it can be found in high-end retailers across Canada, the UK, Australia, the Middle East, Asia, China, Japan, and Korea.

A key element in Terani Couture’s success has been its immersion in the same community. Peter notes, “Terani Couture drew strength from other brands and influencers in its community – a key to building a brand that many businesses overlook.”

Strategic partnerships with the Miss USA pageant further accelerated the brand's growth and featured in top magazines like Teen Vogue and Seventeen. Celebrities such as Kylie Jenner, Vanna White, Kendall Jenner, Ashley Greene, Shawn Johnson, and Madeline Carroll have all worn Terani Couture, helping to solidify its place in the spotlight. The brand’s presence on television and in films such as Twilight, Gossip Girl, and American Idol further cemented its popularity.

One of the significant challenges the brand faced was deciding what to keep in-house and what to outsource.

Peter explains, “Do you hire critical, key players who keep the business running like a well-oiled machine, or do you hire a small staff of specialized skill sets to help take the business to the next level?”

To tackle this challenge, Peter established an advisory committee to guide decisions and maximize available resources.

Planning has been crucial to Terani Couture's success. Peter emphasizes the importance of starting each year with a “year in review” day to refresh and plan for the upcoming year.

This allows the brand to stay ahead of the competition by adapting to changing markets and trends. Building an advisory board composed of mentors and investors has been integral in gathering feedback from employees, customers, and partners before making critical decisions.

Digital marketing and content creation have also significantly influenced the brand's strategy. As Peter advises, “Make sure that you’re addressing all points of the brand trifecta to help build a powerful brand,” referring to brand identity, voice, and persona.

Terani Couture’s e-commerce platform has become a key driver of its success. Peter credits much of this success to the brand’s focus on “Guest Posting,” providing helpful content to other brands and journalists to drive engagement. "We craft high-quality ‘how-to’ and listicle content on our website to inspire users to share the content,” he says.

Peter’s advice for beginners is straightforward: “Business is a long game that you won’t win on your own.” He encourages entrepreneurs to invite trusted advisors and mentors into their journey from the start, as “they should be comfortable with honesty and transparency.”

By making a community of mentors and peers, entrepreneurs can build a strong support network that provides resources and accountability throughout their business journey.
