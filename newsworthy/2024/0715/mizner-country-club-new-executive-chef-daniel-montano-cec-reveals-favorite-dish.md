# Mizner Country Club New Executive Chef, Daniel Montano, Cec, Reveals Favorite Dish

Delray Beach, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Jul 15, 2024 @ 6:00 AM Pacific — Chef Daniel Montano's appointment as Mizner Country Club’s new Executive Chef has been a rousing success. His celebrated innovative culinary style, which blends traditional Hispanic flavors with contemporary techniques, has added a fresh perspective to Delray Beach Country Club’s dynamic culinary landscape.

Chef Montano, recently recognized with his inclusion on Club & Resort Business’s "40 Under 40" list, reveals one of his favorite dishes: Pozole Verde. “Pozole Verde, one of my favorite stews, is found only on the weekends at almost any authentic Mexican restaurant. My favorite is the green version, so I will share this recipe Oh, I firmly believe Pozole tastes better the next day, so prepare enough to enjoy leftovers the next day,” he says.

For the Pozole:

* 2 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into bite-sized pieces
* 2 cans (29 oz each) hominy, drained
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 8 cups chicken broth
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* Salt and pepper to taste

For the Green Sauce:

* 1 pound tomatillos, husked and rinsed
* 2 poblano peppers, stemmed and seeded
* 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves
* 1 onion, chopped
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* Juice of 2 limes
* Salt and pepper to taste

Toppings (optional):

* Shredded cabbage
* Radishes, sliced
* Avocado, sliced
* Lime wedges
* Chopped cilantro
* Tortilla chips or tostadas

Note: If you are in a rush, feel free to substitute the green sauce for a 16oz jar of mild salsa verde. I enjoy using the Herdez brand.

Instructions:

(1) Start by preparing the green sauce. In a large pot of boiling water, cook the tomatillos and poblano peppers for about 5-7 minutes until they become tender. Drain and let them cool slightly.

(2) In a blender or food processor, combine the boiled tomatillos, poblano peppers, cilantro, chopped onion, minced garlic, lime juice, salt, and pepper. Blend until you have a smooth sauce. Set aside.

(3) In a large soup pot or Dutch oven, heat some oil over medium-high heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.

(4) Add the pork pieces to the pot and brown them on all sides.

(5) Pour in the chicken broth, add the hominy, dried oregano, and the green sauce you prepared earlier. Bring the mixture to a simmer.

(6) Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the pozole cook for at least 1.5 to 2 hours until the pork is tender. Stir occasionally and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.

(7) Serve the pozole verde hot, garnished with your choice of toppings such as shredded cabbage, radishes, avocado slices, lime wedges, chopped cilantro, and tortilla chips or tostadas.
