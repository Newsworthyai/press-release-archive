# EcS+ Aims to Cut Business Energy Costs by 30%; Woman-Owned Expense Reduction Firm Helps Businesses Combat Rising Energy Expenses

Carmel, NY (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Jul 15, 2024 @ 6:00 AM Pacific â€” As business energy costs continue to surge, EcS+, a woman-owned cost savings and efficiency firm, announces its Energy Expense Reduction Services, offering businesses across 17 states an effective solution to manage and reduce their energy bills.

The Problem - Rising Energy Costs

Rising energy costs are a significant burden on businesses. Over the last two decades, commercial electricity rates have nearly doubled, increasing from a national average of 7.5 cents to 13 cents per kWh. Small businesses are particularly affected, as higher energy costs increase the expense of running equipment and heating and cooling the premises.

Harilaos Aspromatis of the Verona American Grill in Verona, New Jersey recently signed on with EcS+ and immediately realized a savings of 38.5% on the restaurant's electricity costs and 13% on gas.

"The efficiency experts at EcS+ were easy to work with and implementation was seamless," said Mr. Aspromatis.
