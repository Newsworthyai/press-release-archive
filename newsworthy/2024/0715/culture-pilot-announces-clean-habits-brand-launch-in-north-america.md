# Culture Pilot announces Clean Habits Brand Launch in North America

Houston, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Jul 15, 2024 @ 7:00 AM UTC — Clean Habits, a visionary cleaning products brand led by founder Kristy Phillips, is set to redefine home cleanliness and challenge the market with its pioneering use of HEIQ Synbio Technology. Their patented formula combines prebiotics and probiotics to provide a “nana-grade safe,” non-toxic clean that keeps bacteria at bay for up to five full days — a first in the North American market.

The New Brand That's Revolutionizing Cleanliness

“We’re not just launching a cleaning line — we’re starting a movement,” said Kristy Phillips, Founder & Managing Partner of Clean Habits. "Culture Pilot transformed an idea in my head to what it has become today. Thanks to their bold approach, we gained major retail buyers' attention. It's a great feeling when CVS, Walgreens, HEB, Whole Foods, and Walmart tell us they love the branding and that it will look great on their shelves. I am truly grateful Culture Pilot took a chance with me.”

A Collaborative Effort for Maximum Impact

Culture Pilot has played an integral role in bringing Clean Habits to life. Over the past year, the Texas-based agency has provided comprehensive services including brand strategy and positioning, visual identity, packaging design, website development, tradeshow design, and retail display concepts. Culture Pilot’s digital marketing, go-to-market strategy, and the collective strength of the entire team have been pivotal in driving initial market engagement, building momentum toward the Clean Habits retail growth.

"We're thrilled to partner with Clean Habits to introduce their first-of-its-kind product line to North America," said Tim DeSilva, Co-founder and CEO at Culture Pilot. "Our goal was to create a fun, energetic brand to reflect the innovation and environmental responsibility that Clean Habits embodies. I'm honored to work alongside such strong colleagues; the team has poured their hearts into building and marketing another noteworthy brand to lead the way."

Clean Habits is already making a splash at www.getcleanhabits.com and is rolling out into major retailers across North America.
