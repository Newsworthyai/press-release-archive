# Beautiful Machine Magazine Hosts 5th Anniversary Holiday Party “Gifted,” Celebrating Community and Philanthropy

Detroit, MI (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Dec 23, 2024 @ 6:30 PM US/Pacific — Beautiful Machine Magazine commemorated its 5th Anniversary with its signature holiday event, Gifted, bringing together a diverse group of attendees including filmmakers, musicians, models, entertainment industry professionals, and entrepreneurs. The event served as a celebration of community, creativity, and the spirit of giving back to Detroit.

Hosted by Publisher and Creative Director Demetrius Carrington, Vice President Antisia King, and media correspondents Dr. Natasha Weems and Myles Hardy, the evening was a vibrant networking opportunity where attendees united to uplift the city of Detroit while supporting a worthy cause.

Gifted featured the collection of toys to benefit Filthy Cares, a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting underserved children during the holiday season. Building on the success of last year’s toy drive, which collected over 5,000 toys, this year’s event set an ambitious goal of gathering 7,000 toys to spread joy to even more children.

“This event represents the heart of what Detroit is all about—community, creativity, and compassion,” said Vice President Antisia King. “It’s inspiring to see so many people come together, not only to celebrate but to make a tangible difference for children in need.”Attendees embraced the spirit of giving while enjoying opportunities to connect, collaborate, and celebrate the creative energy of Detroit. The event highlighted Beautiful Machine Magazine’s commitment to not only showcasing the city’s talent but also uplifting its underserved communities.
