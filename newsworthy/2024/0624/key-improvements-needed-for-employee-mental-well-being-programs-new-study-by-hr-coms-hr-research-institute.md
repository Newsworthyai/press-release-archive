# Key Improvements Needed for Employee Mental Well-being Programs - New Study by HR.com’s HR Research Institute

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Jun 24, 2024 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — As workplaces evolve and prioritize employee well-being, new research sheds light on effective strategies for human resources (HR) professionals to bolster mental health support and alleviate workplace stress. The study, conducted by HR.com’s HR Research Institute, highlights significant gaps and promising trends in how organizations approach mental health initiatives.

The full research report, HR.com’s State of Mental Health and Stress in the Workplace 2024, is available for free download to provide actionable takeaways and tips for HR professionals looking to improve their mental wellness programs.

Key findings reveal a stark reality: only about 2 in 10 organizations currently possess methods to measure employee mental health and stress levels. Conversely, organizations excelling in mental health support are six times more likely to have established metrics for tracking employee well-being. This disparity underscores the critical need for robust measurement frameworks to gauge and improve mental health initiatives within workplaces.

The research further notes a positive trend in organizational self-assessment regarding mental health support effectiveness over the past five years. However there’s a concerning finding that a substantial 62% or HR professionals report feeling stressed at work, with an overwhelming 77% noting stress as prevalent within their organizations. This firsthand experience underscores the urgency for HR leaders to not only advocate for but also personally benefit from improved mental health support frameworks.

"This study underscores the critical need for robust measurement frameworks to gauge and improve mental health initiatives," stated Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator and CEO of HR.com. "By prioritizing metrics and tracking and fostering supportive cultures, organizations can better understand how they can effectively mitigate stress and enhance employee well-being."

The full report, HR.com’s State of Mental Health and Stress in the Workplace 2024, is available for free download and provides more detail and additional tips to help boost the overall mental well-being of employers’ most precious resource.

The recording of the research presentation, The Stress Test: Why Organizations Struggle to Manage Employee Mental Health Today, is available for viewing 24/7 on demand.
