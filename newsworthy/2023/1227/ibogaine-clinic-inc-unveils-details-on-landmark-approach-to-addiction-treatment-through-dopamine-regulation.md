# Ibogaine Clinic Inc Unveils Details on Landmark Approach to Addiction Treatment through Dopamine Regulation

Playa del Carmen, Mexico (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Dec 27, 2023 @ 7:00 AM Eastern — Ibogaine Clinic Inc, a pioneer in addiction treatment, has announced its cutting-edge approach to combating addiction by harnessing the unique properties of ibogaine, a natural occurring psychoactive substance, to regulate dopamine receptors, offering new hope for individuals struggling with addiction, depression, anxiety, and PTSD.

“After so many years successfully adapting our protocols to each individual's specific needs, we’ve had no shortage inquiries about the neurological functions on how we achieve it,” says facility founder Rabbi David Dardashti. “Ibogaine’s function on regulating dopamine receptors is one massive piece of the puzzle, which we incorporate with a wealth of other tools to achieve the desired healing result.”

Restoring Balance in the Brain

Ibogaine, derived from the roots of the iboga plant, is renowned for its ability to restore and modulate dopamine receptors in the brain. This psychoactive alkaloid increases levels of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), inducing a calming effect on the brain. This mechanism significantly reduces cravings and withdrawal symptoms, common challenges in overcoming drug addiction.

Addressing the Root Cause of Addiction

Addictive substances alter the brain's dopamine system, responsible for pleasure, motivation, and movement, leading to tolerance and dependence. Ibogaine's interaction with various neurotransmitter systems, particularly the dopamine system, is critical. By inhibiting monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity, ibogaine increases dopamine availability, counteracting the harmful effects of chronic drug use on the brain's reward system.

A key aspect of Ibogaine Clinic Inc's approach is the activation of the D3 dopamine receptor, a crucial element in addiction development and relapse. Activation of this receptor has demonstrated reduced drug-seeking behavior in animal models, highlighting its potential in human treatments.

Promoting Neuroplasticity for Lasting Change

Beyond its immediate effects in helping the subject access and process their traumas, ibogaine promotes neuroplasticity – the brain's ability to adapt and change. This is vital in reversing the long-term changes caused by addictive drugs and restoring normal functionality to the dopamine system.

Ibogaine by David Dardashti’s innovative use of ibogaine represents a significant advancement in addiction therapy, and is continuing to foster in the future of the ibogaine movement. The natural substance’s ability to regulate dopamine and promote brain healing offers a promising path for those seeking an effective treatment for addiction and related disorders, but only when used under strict protocols by individuals with an impeccable track record of working with the substance, and under medical supervision.
