# TMS Solutions: Transforming Lives through Revolutionary Depression Therapy

Salt Lake City, UT (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Nov 21, 2023 @ 6:00 PM Eastern â€” TMS Solutions, a leading provider of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) therapy, is redefining the treatment landscape for depression. With their drug-free, non-invasive approach, TMS Solutions is empowering individuals to overcome depression and regain control of their lives.

TMS therapy involves stimulating neurons in the brain by delivering magnetic pulses, resulting in improved or eliminated depression symptoms. As a groundbreaking alternative, TMS therapy offers patients a safe and highly effective treatment option. Unlike traditional methods, TMS therapy requires no sedation or anesthesia and, for the majority of patients, carries no side effects.

Since its FDA clearance in 2008, TMS therapy has been changing lives. In fact, TMS Solutions has achieved remarkable results, with 73% of their patients experiencing a reduction in depression symptoms. What's more, an impressive 49% have achieved complete remission. It comes as no surprise that TMS treatment is covered by most major medical insurance companies, Medicare, and Medicaid in select states.

At TMS Solutions, patient-centered care is paramount. With a dedicated technician for each patient and end-of-treatment evaluations conducted by licensed providers, individuals receive personalized attention throughout their treatment journey. Over the years, TMS Solutions has administered an astounding 80,000 treatments, making a profound impact on countless lives.

As pioneers in their field, TMS Solutions holds the distinction of being the only civilian TMS provider pre-qualified by the VA to treat veterans across the United States. This recognition underscores their commitment to serving those who have served our country. In addition, TMS Solutions is honored to be among the select group of ten providers chosen for a Mayo Clinic-led FDA adolescent clinical trial, further showcasing their dedication to advancing the field of TMS therapy.

Motivated by a desire to provide an affordable and proven effective treatment option, Christopher Blackburn founded TMS Solutions. Witnessing the struggles of individuals battling depression and undergoing ineffective treatments, he set out to make a difference. Today, TMS Solutions stands as a beacon of hope for those seeking an innovative solution for depression.

Patient testimonials offer a glimpse into the profound impact of TMS therapy. Individuals have expressed their gratitude for the life-altering benefits they have experienced after undergoing TMS treatment.
