# Vancouver Clinic Offers Groundbreaking TMS Therapy for the Treatment of Depression

Vancouver, WA (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Nov 21, 2023 @ 5:00 PM Eastern â€” TMS therapy involves the use of a small coil placed over the head to deliver magnetic stimulation to specific areas of the brain responsible for depression. This non-invasive procedure boosts brain activity and has been FDA-approved for the treatment of depression. TMS NW is proud to join the nationwide movement in utilizing this revolutionary treatment option.

Dr. John Smith, Medical Director at TMS NW, expressed his belief in the potential of TMS therapy, stating, "We have witnessed the transformative power of TMS therapy in countless individuals struggling with depression. It's incredibly rewarding to be able to offer this safe and effective treatment option to our patients."

TMS NW's treatment process begins with a comprehensive diagnostic assessment to determine whether TMS therapy is suitable for the individual. Once approved, the clinic assists patients in obtaining prior authorization from their insurance providers. This dedication to navigating the insurance process ensures that the therapy remains accessible to as many individuals as possible.

During the treatment process, TMS NW provides mapping and motor threshold determination to personalize each patient's therapy. Daily TMS treatments are administered under the supervision of highly trained professionals, with the option for refresher treatments if needed. The clinic works closely with patients' prescribing providers to ensure a holistic approach to comprehensive care.

While TMS NW does not manage client medications long-term, the clinic offers assistance with medication adjustments during the treatment period. After completing TMS therapy, clients are advised to continue medication management with their prescribing provider. The collaborative effort between TMS NW and other healthcare professionals provides a seamless transition for patients post-treatment.

TMS NW understands that the cost of treatment can be a concern for many individuals. As a result, the clinic works with most insurance providers and offers flexible payment options. Patients may be required to pay an insurance copay or percentage (coinsurance) at each session to make the therapy more affordable.
