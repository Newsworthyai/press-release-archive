Long Beach, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Dec 21, 2023 @ 3:00 PM Eastern â€” With a team of dedicated psychiatrists, therapists, and specialists, the clinic aims to provide comprehensive care for various mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, ADHD, bipolar disorder, sleep disorders, panic disorders, substance abuse, and schizophrenia.

"At Pacific Mind Health, our priority is to provide evidence-based treatments for mental health problems and substance use disorders," says Dr. Emily Parker, a renowned psychiatrist at Pacific Mind Health. "Our team of experts is committed to offering personalized medicine using genetic testing and a variety of therapeutic approaches to meet each individual's unique needs."

One of the cutting-edge treatments offered at Pacific Mind Health is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive therapy that uses magnetic fields to stimulate specific areas of the brain. Dr. Parker explains, "TMS therapy has shown great success in treating depression and is particularly beneficial for patients who have not responded well to medication or other traditional therapies."

Furthermore, Pacific Mind Health is excited to announce that they will soon be offering Ketamine/Spravato Therapy, another groundbreaking treatment option. Dr. Parker states, "Ketamine therapy has shown promising results for individuals with treatment-resistant depression and offers new hope for those who have exhausted other treatment options. We believe in providing cutting-edge therapies like Ketamine/Spravato to improve the quality of life for our patients."

In addition to medication management and innovative therapies, Pacific Mind Health also offers psychotherapy services, ADHD testing and treatment, and pharmacogenomic testing to further enhance treatment outcomes. Whether through in-person appointments or convenient telemedicine options, the clinic's dedicated providers are available to support individuals on their mental health journey.

Pacific Mind Health aims to make mental health care accessible to as many individuals as possible and accepts several insurance providers.
