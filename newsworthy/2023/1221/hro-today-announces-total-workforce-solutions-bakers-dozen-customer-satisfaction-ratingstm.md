# HRO Today Announces Total Workforce Solutions Baker’s Dozen Customer Satisfaction Ratings™

Philadelphia, PA (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Dec 21, 2023 @ 7:00 AM Pacific — SharedXpertise Media, publishers of HRO Today magazine and HRO Today Global, producers of the Baker’s Dozen Customer Satisfaction Ratings, and organizers of the HRO Today Forums and Educational Events announced the HRO Today  Total Workforce Solutions Baker’s Dozen Customer Satisfaction Ratings™.  Based solely on feedback from buyers of the rated services, the ratings are not based on the opinion of the HRO Today staff.  HRO Today collects feedback annually through an online survey which they distribute to buyers directly through the HRO Today mailing lists and indirectly through service providers.

Since 2018, a section was added to both the managed service program (MSP) and recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) Baker’s Dozen Customer Satisfaction Ratings™ questionnaires that addressed the use of total workforce solutions (TWS). If respondents indicated they use the same provider for both contingent and full-time employee needs, they were asked a series of questions pertaining to TWS. These study results were then combined with the relevant components of the MSP and RPO study findings and consolidated into one data set.

The methodology that produced the ranked list was very consistent with other Baker’s Dozen studies. To determine an overall ranking from this data, HRO Today analyzes results across three subcategories: service breadth, size of deals, and quality of service. Using a predetermined algorithm that weighs questions and categories based on importance, HRO Today calculates scores in all three subcategories as well as an overall score. These scores are the basis of the Baker’s Dozen Customer Satisfaction Ratings™ and are presented in the following tables to demonstrate the relative differences among the ranked service providers.

The only influence that HRO Today has on the outcome of this survey is that HRO Today discards incomplete surveys or surveys outside the normal distribution. This includes surveys that are too perfect as to be possible or so negative that they are spiteful and inaccurate.

Otherwise, HRO Today has no impact on the survey outcome. While HRO Today does not claim that its methodology is the only viable rating program available, HRO Today does vouch for its statistical validity. HRO Today hopes the TWS Baker’s Dozen Customer Satisfaction Ratings™ provide insight into a company's next RFP process.
