# TMS NW Introduces Transformative TMS Therapy for Mental Health Wellness

Vancouver, WA (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Dec 21, 2023 @ 3:00 PM Eastern â€” TMS therapy is FDA approved and has been successfully used in over 1 million treatments nationwide. With its exceptional track record, TMS NW is proud to bring this cutting-edge therapy to the Vancouver, Longview, and Tigard areas, ensuring more individuals can access the transformational benefits of TMS brain therapy.

"TMS therapy has truly revolutionized the way we approach mental health treatment," says Dr. Piper Buersmeyer, one of TMS NW's esteemed practitioners. "Through the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation, we are able to stimulate specific regions of the brain responsible for mood regulation, leading to an improvement in symptoms of depression. It's an incredible breakthrough that offers hope and relief to those struggling with mental health challenges."

TMS NW's treatment path begins with a comprehensive diagnostic assessment to determine the suitability of TMS therapy for each individual. With insurance coverage available, the team at TMS NW will assist clients in obtaining prior authorization, typically taking 3 to 10 days.

After the initial assessment, clients will receive tailored treatment sessions administered by highly skilled practitioners. The treatment process involves daily 19-minute sessions, Monday through Friday, for a duration of 3 to 9 weeks. Additional sessions can be requested as needed, and adjustments in medication can be facilitated during the treatment period for those who require it.

"Our goal is to provide effective, evidence-based mental health treatments that empower individuals to improve their quality of life," explains Dr. Buersmeyer. "We recognize that TMS therapy is just one part of a comprehensive plan to optimize mental wellness, and that's why we collaborate closely with a client's prescribing provider for ongoing medication management."

TMS NW is committed to making TMS therapy accessible to as many individuals as possible. The therapy is covered by most insurances, with clients potentially paying a copay or coinsurance at each session.
