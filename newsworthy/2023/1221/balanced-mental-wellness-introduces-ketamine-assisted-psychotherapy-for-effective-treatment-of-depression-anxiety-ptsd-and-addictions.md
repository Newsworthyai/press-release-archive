# Balanced Mental Wellness Introduces Ketamine Assisted Psychotherapy for Effective Treatment of Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, and Addictions

Englewood Colorado (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Dec 21, 2023 @ 3:00 PM Eastern â€” With a focus on combining medication and therapy, KAP offers a unique approach to therapy that promotes lasting change and enhances the healing experience.

Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, has long been recognized as a safe and effective treatment for various mental health conditions. By working on the neurotransmitter called Glutamate and enhancing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ketamine promotes the regeneration of synaptic connections and enhances neuroplasticity. This results in rapid antidepressant effects within 24 hours, with effects lasting weeks to months after repeated doses.

"At Balanced Mental Wellness, our aim is to help individuals gain access to their authentic selves and promote personal growth," says Dr. Smith, a leading expert in Ketamine Assisted Psychotherapy. "Our approach involves combining specific therapeutic interventions with the administration of Ketamine medication. By doing so, we create longer-lasting results and help individuals reconnect with themselves, heal emotional wounds, and find true healing."

Sessions typically last for 2 hours and encompass the administration of Ketamine medication via injection or lozenges, along with integration therapy before and after the medicine. This comprehensive approach allows individuals to delve deeper into their healing journey and experience profound transformations.

"At Balanced Mental Wellness, we firmly believe that each individual possesses their own internal healer," explains Dr. Smith. "Our role as psychedelic guides is to provide the necessary space for that inner healer to surface. By incorporating indigenous practices with psychedelic medicines, we aim to help individuals reconnect and come home to themselves, enabling the healing of wounds and fostering a lasting connection to their true selves."
