# Chicago Homeowner’s Life-Changing Journey with Curbio

Potomac, MD (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Dec 8, 2023 @ 9:23 AM Pacific — When Tiffany White’s father passed away, her world was rattled. Not only was she grieving her loss, but as an only child, she suddenly found herself responsible for a myriad of stressful tasks, including selling her father’s home. To help overcome the burden of selling an outdated home, White’s realtor enlisted the help of Curbio, the nation’s leading pre-listing contractor for real estate agents.

Curbio specializes in pre-sale home improvements that appeal to potential buyers. In consulting with White and her agent, Curbio recommended a list of projects that included a kitchen refresh, flooring updates and bathroom touch-ups.

“The whole consultation process was very pivotal for me. We talked about what homeowners want to see, and the experience that Curbio has had in the past helping clients bring their home to a point where buyers are elated and want to buy the home. Their recommendations took the home from 1989 to 2020,” said White.

Curbio takes a tech-powered approach to home improvement, providing clients with access to its app that enables real-time communication with their Curbio project manager. Curbio’s app allows clients to view photos and videos of the project and provide feedback from any location and on any device, removing the barriers to effective communication that have plagued traditional home improvement for decades.

“That app was fantastic because I could put things in the app, but I was also involved from the standpoint of being able to give my feedback. If there were things that I didn’t like about what was done, I could tell my project manager and the workers would fix it. I felt like I was part of the entire process,” said White. “I could stay focused on the things that I really needed to do. I would sum it up by saying Curbio was a lifesaver for me, they made my life so much easier.”

Once the project was completed and the house was put on the market, the house had multiple offers right away, including one over the asking price. White describes working with Curbio as, “the best decision that we ever could have made because Curbio was a great partner. They do great work, and the final product was excellent.”

Since working with Curbio, White has entered the world of real estate herself by becoming a real estate broker. Now, she uses her own experience to put herself in her clients’ shoes to help them navigate any barriers they may face in the home-selling process.

“Going through the process with my agent and selling my dad’s home, I know the capacity and I know the relationships that brokers have with their clients. I experienced firsthand these fears that a seller has when they’re selling their home. And my agent, Moe, gave me such a fantastic experience that I use that same experience when I’m working with my clients,” said White.

By providing pre-listing home improvements with zero payment due upfront, Curbio has helped countless homeowners like Tiffany White to get their homes market-ready with ease.

“While the core of our business is acting as a contractor partner to real estate agents, it makes us incredibly proud to hear stories like Tiffany’s. Curbio has set out to modernize home improvement for the real estate industry, making it as stress-free as possible for both agents and homeowners. We are so glad that we could take the burden of pre-listing improvements off Tiffany’s shoulders during a stressful time in her life, and ultimately contributed to a favorable outcome in the sale of her late father’s home,” said Darren Stewart, Chief Operating Officer at Curbio.
