# Neurofeedback Therapy: Transforming Lives at New Direction Functional Psychiatry

Lancaster, PA (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Dec 14, 2023 @ 6:00 PM Eastern â€” Neurofeedback Therapy is a non-invasive, drug-free approach that helps individuals retrain their brainwaves, improving their emotional well-being and mental performance. By providing real-time feedback on brainwave activity, this state-of-the-art technology allows patients to gain greater control over their brain function and helps them manage symptoms related to anxiety, depression, ADHD, and trauma, among others.

"We are thrilled to offer Neurofeedback Therapy to our patients as part of our commitment to providing advanced and effective treatments," said Dr. Sarah Gatumu, MD, founder of New Direction Functional Psychiatry. "We have witnessed firsthand the transformative power of Neurofeedback Therapy in helping individuals overcome their mental health challenges and achieve lasting wellness."

Neurofeedback Therapy works by utilizing specialized equipment that monitors brainwave activity and provides visual or auditory reinforcement to guide the brain toward healthier patterns. Through repetitive training sessions, patients learn to modulate their brainwave activity, resulting in improved mental clarity, emotional stability, and overall cognitive function.

Dr. Gatumu added, "What sets Neurofeedback Therapy apart is its ability to address the root cause of mental health conditions rather than simply managing symptoms. By allowing patients to visualize their brain activity and learn self-regulation, we empower them to take an active role in their mental health journey."

The team at New Direction Functional Psychiatry is highly trained and experienced in administering Neurofeedback Therapy to patients of all ages. They work closely with each individual to develop personalized treatment plans that target specific mental health concerns and adapt as progress is made.
