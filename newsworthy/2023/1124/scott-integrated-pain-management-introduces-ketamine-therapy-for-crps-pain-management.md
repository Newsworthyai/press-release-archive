Ketamine therapy has shown promising results in managing CRPS, and our goal is to provide comprehensive care to our patients by offering this alternative approach."

Scott Integrated Pain Management is one of the few clinics that accept insurance for Ketamine therapy, making it more accessible and affordable for patients. This groundbreaking treatment has shown great potential in relieving pain, reducing inflammation, and improving function for individuals suffering from CRPS.

The introduction of Ketamine therapy aligns with Scott Integrated Pain Management's commitment to finding opioid alternatives for challenging pain conditions. By offering this treatment, the clinic aims to provide comprehensive and personalized care to patients seeking relief from chronic pain.

Dr. Scott encourages patients with CRPS to explore the benefits of Ketamine therapy. He states, "Our team is dedicated to tailoring treatment plans that best suit the needs of our patients.
