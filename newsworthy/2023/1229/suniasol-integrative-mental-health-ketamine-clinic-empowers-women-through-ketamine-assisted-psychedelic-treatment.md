# Suniasol Integrative Mental Health & Ketamine Clinic Empowers Women Through Ketamine Assisted Psychedelic Treatment

Boulder, CO (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Dec 29, 2023 @ 7:00 AM Eastern â€” As experts in Ketamine Assisted Psychedelic Treatment, Suniasol Clinic offers a personalized approach to therapy, tailoring treatment to each individual's needs and goals. Through the use of Ketamine, commonly known as Consciousness Medicine, the clinic helps patients break free from negative thought patterns and distorted mental filters associated with the rumination that accompanies depression. This process allows individuals to experience hidden aspects of themselves that are typically inaccessible due to the constant chatter of the mind.

"Through our Women's Empowerment Ketamine Series, we aim to provide a safe and supportive environment for women to explore their inner selves and work towards healing and transformation," says Dr. Sarah Johnson, lead psychiatrist at Suniasol Clinic. "We understand the unique challenges faced by women, and we are committed to empowering them in their healing journeys."

Ketamine works by temporarily silencing the Default Mode Network (DMN) in the brain, enhancing the formation of healthier mental pathways and promoting the release of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). Research has shown the effectiveness of Ketamine in treating Treatment-Resistant Depression, PTSD, and anxiety.

Prospective patients can learn more about the Women's Empowerment Ketamine Series and other services offered by Suniasol Clinic by visiting their website and filling out the necessary forms. The clinic provides information about fees and insurance coverage, and testimonials from previous patients are available. Additionally, a regularly updated blog with relevant mental health articles provides valuable insights for individuals seeking information or support.
