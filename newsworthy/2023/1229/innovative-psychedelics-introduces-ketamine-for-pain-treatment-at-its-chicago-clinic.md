# Innovative Psychedelics Introduces Ketamine for Pain Treatment at its Chicago Clinic

Chicago, IL (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Dec 29, 2023 @ 7:00 AM Eastern â€” Ketamine treatment has shown remarkable results in alleviating severe depression, mood disorders, and now, chronic pain. Although ketamine for pain is considered off-label as it has not yet received FDA approval for this purpose, the clinic is committed to offering groundbreaking therapies that go beyond conventional methods.

"While ketamine may have potential side effects such as high blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, and perceptual disturbances, we strongly believe in the effectiveness of this treatment for pain patients," says Dr. Khare, a highly experienced board-certified emergency physician who administers ketamine therapy at Innovative Psychedelics. "By employing a carefully crafted treatment protocol involving a 3-hour infusion, scheduled once a month, we can significantly reduce the impact of chronic pain on our patients' lives."

Recognizing the unique nature of pain treatment with ketamine, the clinic has established protocols that employ higher doses of ketamine to maximize the therapeutic effects. This approach comes with a greater risk of side effects, which is why it is crucial to have a knowledgeable and experienced medical professional overseeing the process.

In addition to ketamine therapy, Innovative Psychedelics also provides Spravato treatments for both depression and pain. Patients have convenient access to their bills and records through the clinic's patient portal, simplifying the administrative aspects of their treatment.
