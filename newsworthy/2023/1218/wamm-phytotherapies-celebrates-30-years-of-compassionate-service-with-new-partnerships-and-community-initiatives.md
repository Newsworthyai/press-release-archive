# WAMM Phytotherapies Celebrates 30 Years of Compassionate Service with New Partnerships and Community Initiatives

Santa Cruz, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Dec 18, 2023 @ 10:30 AM Pacific — Wamm Phytotherapies, formerly WAMM (Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana), renowned as the nation’s oldest medical cannabis collective, proudly marks its 30th year of dedicated service. This significant milestone is further celebrated with the announcement of an empowering collaboration with local dispensaries The Hook Outlet and Treehouse.

Background

Established as a non-profit entity nestled under the Alliance for Compassionate Access, Wamm Phytotherapies continues to be a beacon of hope, providing medical cannabis and holistic care to those in dire need. The longstanding commitment to health and wellness is bolstered through partnerships with Treehouse Dispensary and The Hook Outlet, enhancing its ability to serve the community and providing a place for members to connect, meet, and access medicine.

Valerie Corral, co-founder of WAMM, reflects on the journey: “For more than three decades, WAMM Phyto's collective worked to transform the lives of seriously ill people through access, social and political work. Our services touch lives, give hope, and provide plant medicines, making illness and death a little less painful. Our vision to provide services and our commitment to holistic care and the health of our community remains unwavering. In growing a partnership with people who share our values and mission, an opportunity arises to serve more and to serve better. This is the only way for us to meet the ever-growing needs of the sick and dying.”

Wamm Compassion Program Re-launch

Treehouse Dispensary, a community-centric establishment located in Soquel, CA, has stepped up to support WAMM Phyto's mission. This collaboration has already resulted in weekly donations of medical cannabis products, benefiting almost 60 WAMM members. These efforts are further supported by generous contributions from local Santa Cruz Cannabis companies like Coastal Sun, Highway One Distribution, Bird Valley Organics, and others, including Lowell Farms, Wonder Extracts, Sauce Essentials, Heavy Hitters, House Cannabis, and Almora.

Bryce Berryessa, Co-founder of The Hook and Treehouse, expresses excitement about the partnership: “Joining forces with WAMM is not just about providing medical cannabis; it's about nurturing a community and making a real difference in the lives of those who need it most. We are privileged and honored to help collaborate and carry on the legacy of service that this wonderful organization has provided to our community for 30 years.”

Community Meetings

In a heartwarming return to normalcy post-pandemic, WAMM Phyto has resumed its regular in-person meetings (presently only once a month) at Treehouse on the first Tuesday of the month. These community-building gatherings rekindle the safe haven where members find emotional and social support. This is a stand as a testament to WAMM Phyto's dedication to problem-solving, personal attention, empowerment, consciousness and providing personal care during a time when isolation has replaced community. WAMM member, Arturo Ayala, who benefits from the compassion program, shares their experience: “I'm a veteran with PTSD on a fixed income and rely on WAMM Phyto's support & the help of its partners to bridge some of the challenges. This has been a lifeline for me. It's more than just medical; it's about trust, feeling valued, and being cared about during the tough times.”

Pay-It-Forward Round Up Program

Another significant stride in WAMM's journey is its partnership with The Hook Outlet. In a unique initiative called 'Pay-It-Forward Round Up Program,' The Hook Outlet encourages its members to donate coin change to the Alliance for Compassionate Access (ACA), the 501c3 non-profit arm of WAMM Phytotherapies. This initiative supports terminally ill members with end-of-life care and advocacy. Launched in September, this program has already raised an impressive $5,000 thanks to generous donations from Hook Outlet patrons.

Education and Outreach

“Wamm Phytotherapies and The Hook Outlet proudly present www.safecannabis.net, a key resource in our drive for safe, responsible cannabis use. This platform offers guidance on proper storage, youth substance prevention education, and responsible adult use. Our Q1 2024 plans include a major media campaign with local cannabis businesses to address youth substance prevention and impacts of teen use, highlighting our commitment to a well-informed, safe community." - Bayley Logan, Marketing Director, The Hook Outlet

Santa Cruz City Retail Expansion

Looking ahead, Wamm Phytotherapies, in collaboration with The Hook Outlet and Treehouse Dispensary, is set to expand its outreach. The trio is currently in the process of opening a new retail location in the city of Santa Cruz under the Hook Outlet brand at the former iconic Emily’s Good Things to Eat Bakery location on Mission St. This expansion will enable the WAMM Compassion program to serve over 200 members, with planned pick-up points in Watsonville, Soquel, and Santa Cruz City by the end of 2024.

As WAMM Phytotherapies commemorates its 30th anniversary, it stands as a symbol of hope, resilience, and unwavering support for those in need. The collective's journey, enriched by meaningful partnerships and community support, continues to be a source of inspiration and a beacon of compassionate care in the medical cannabis realm.
