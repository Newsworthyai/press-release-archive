# Straightening Teeth in Three Months Possible? New Science Says Yes.

Salt Lake City, Utah (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Dec 20, 2023 @ 11:45 AM Pacific â€” OrthodontiCell, Inc., an innovator in bioelectric-induced protein expression therapies for orthodontics, today announced the peer-reviewed publication of positive data for the Company's accelerated teeth straightening study. The published study results demonstrated a significant reduction in teeth straightening time compared to historical controls without any adverse effects reported.

The OrthodontiCell, Inc. publication demonstrates the clinical use of the patented procedure and devices that utilize a patient's biologic protein expressions to temporarily control softening bone, permitting more rapid teeth straightening. There were no safety-related adverse effects reported in the study. Additionally, there was a 70% reduction in pain and discomfort compared to patients with standard braces or aligners due to decreased inflammation.

"The positive data from our published OrthodontiCell study is very encouraging. Being able to treat patients in 4 - 6 months of treatment time helps address the major issue of drop off in compliance of patients at six months when using standard treatment approaches," said Dr. John Marchetto, President, Chief Orthodontic Officer of the Company and Co-Inventor of the patented technology platform. "To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the clinical efficacy of reducing teeth straightening time to 3 to 6 months combined with a 70% reduction in pain and discomfort. OrthodontiCell may represent an attractive option for millions worldwide who suffer from misaligned teeth and seek a more rapid and less painful solution."

The OrthodontiCell, Inc. patent estate covers the precise bioelectric controlled expression of the protein RANK-L to soften bone and the proteins SDF-1 and PDGF for homing stem cells to the stimulated area. It also includes signals for controlled expression of the growth factor, known as VEGF, for increased blood flow to the area which facilitates faster tooth movement.

"OrthodontiCell, Inc. has hundreds of issued, pending, and in-process patent claims for its unique one-of-a-kind technology platform. We have the only known method to control precisely (not too much, not too little) the key protein expressions essential for rapid, pain-free teeth straightening and stabilization. Straight teeth help people live more confidently in social settings, and data shows straight teeth improve your income-making ability in commerce and your ability to attract a mate of choice. This technology is on a path to improve millions of lives potentially. No one wants to wear braces for 18 to 24 months," stated Howard J. Leonhardt, executive chairman and Co-founder of the technology platform.
