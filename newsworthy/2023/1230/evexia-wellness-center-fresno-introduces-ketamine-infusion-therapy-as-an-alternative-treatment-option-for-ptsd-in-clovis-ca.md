# Evexia Wellness Center Fresno Introduces Ketamine Infusion Therapy as an Alternative Treatment Option for PTSD in Clovis, CA

Clovis, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Saturday Dec 30, 2023 @ 12:40 AM Eastern — Traditionally, PTSD has been treated with a combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and medication such as Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). However, SSRIs can take up to 4-6 weeks to show significant improvement. Recognizing the need for a faster and more effective treatment, Evexia Wellness Center Fresno is now offering Ketamine Infusion Therapy.

Ketamine works by binding to NMDA receptors in the brain, increasing the levels of the neurotransmitter glutamate. This, in turn, activates AMPA receptors, which play a crucial role in regulating mood, cognition, and thought patterns. Unlike SSRIs, which require weeks to take effect, Ketamine Infusion Therapy can begin to show noticeable improvements after just a single 45-minute treatment.

While not every patient will have the same response to treatment, the team at Evexia Wellness Center Fresno will work closely with each individual to develop a personalized Ketamine Infusion Therapy plan tailored to their unique needs.
