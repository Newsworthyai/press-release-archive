# Conventions Psychiatry & Counseling Introduces Revolutionary Treatment Option for Depression: TMS Therapy

Warrenville, IL (Newsworthy.ai) Saturday Dec 30, 2023 @ 12:45 AM Eastern — TMS therapy utilizes a magnet to stimulate specific nerve cells in the brain that are associated with mood regulation. These magnetic pulses can positively impact neurotransmitter levels, resulting in a significant decrease in the severity of depression symptoms.

During a TMS treatment session, patients are comfortably seated in a specialized treatment chair, and a magnet, similar to the one used in an MRI machine, is placed on their head. This magnet delivers precise and focused magnetic stimulation to the targeted areas of the brain. The treatment is completely non-invasive, has no impact on alertness or memory, and typically lasts between 19 and 37 minutes.

The TMS therapy provided by Conventions Psychiatry & Counseling has garnered positive feedback from patients who have experienced profound improvements in their mental well-being. Chris, a former patient, shared, "TMS therapy was a game-changer for me. After struggling with depression for years, I finally found a treatment that worked. It gave me the chance to start my road to happiness."

Conventions Psychiatry & Counseling invites individuals seeking effective and life-changing treatment options for depression to explore the transformative benefits of TMS therapy. With its non-invasive nature and potential for long-term remission, this breakthrough treatment provides hope for a brighter future.
