# Ketamine Infusion Therapy: Revolutionizing Treatment for Psychiatric Disorders and Chronic Pain

Rochester, NY (Newsworthy.ai) Saturday Dec 30, 2023 @ 12:30 AM Eastern — According to a recent study, over 70% of patients reported improved function and mood after just one session of ketamine infusion therapy. Patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), chronic pain, and fibromyalgia have experienced promising results. Even combat veterans with PTSD have found solace in this groundbreaking treatment.

The benefits of ketamine infusion therapy extend beyond mental health. It can provide relief from chronic pain, reduce depressive symptoms, and decrease the need for opioid medications. Conditions such as headaches, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), substance abuse, and suicidal ideations have also shown positive responses to this treatment.

Receiving IV ketamine infusion therapy is a straightforward process. Prospective patients are advised to contact the office to determine their candidacy. Once approved, patients attend an initial appointment and complete the necessary intake forms. During the treatment, patients are comfortably seated in a private room, connected to a monitoring device, and administered a small IV catheter. The infusion typically lasts around 40 minutes.

As the efficacy and safety of ketamine infusion therapy continue to be validated through rigorous research and positive patient outcomes, it is becoming increasingly recognized as a cutting-edge option for those struggling with severe psychiatric disorders and chronic pain.
