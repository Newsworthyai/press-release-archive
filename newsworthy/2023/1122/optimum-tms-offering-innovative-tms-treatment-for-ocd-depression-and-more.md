Columbus, OH (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Nov 22, 2023 @ 1:00 AM Eastern â€” Optimum TMS, a leading center in Columbus, OH, is garnering attention for its highly effective TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) treatment for OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) and depression. Patients are raving about the center's welcoming staff and the remarkable results they have experienced.

"I was skeptical at first, but after undergoing TMS treatment at Optimum TMS, my life has completely changed," shared a satisfied patient. "The warm and friendly environment, coupled with the expertise of their team, made the entire experience worthwhile."

Studies reveal that approximately 70% of patients at Optimum TMS report a significant reduction in symptoms, and nearly 50% achieve complete remission. Such impressive success rates further establish Optimum TMS as a trusted provider of effective treatments for OCD and depression.

Optimum TMS understands the importance of exhausting other treatment options before considering TMS therapy. Patients are required to have tried at least two antidepressant medications, undergone talk therapy, and experienced persistent depression. This ensures that TMS is administered to those who genuinely need it.

TMS therapy stands out as the most advanced and breakthrough non-invasive treatment for depression. This groundbreaking approach is medication-free and only takes 20 minutes a day. Its minimal side effects make it highly tolerable among patients.

"We pride ourselves on providing the most advanced treatments for our patients," stated Dr. Emily Watson, Chief Medical Officer at Optimum TMS. "TMS therapy has proven to be a game-changer in the field of mental health, and we are thrilled to offer this life-changing treatment."

Most insurance companies cover TMS treatment, and Optimum TMS assists patients in determining their insurance benefits and potential out-of-pocket costs. In addition, the center provides financing options through CareCredit and in-house payment arrangements, ensuring that financial constraints do not hinder access to treatment.

Optimum TMS offers Brainsway Deep TMS and NeuroStar Advanced Therapy TMS as non-drug treatment options for depression. These cutting-edge therapies have revolutionized the mental health sector, providing hope and relief to countless individuals.

TMS treatment is non-invasive and non-systemic, making it a preferred choice for patients seeking effective treatments for OCD, depression, and other mood disorders.
