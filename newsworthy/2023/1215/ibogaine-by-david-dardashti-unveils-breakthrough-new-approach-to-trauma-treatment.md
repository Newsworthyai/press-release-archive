# Ibogaine by David Dardashti Unveils Breakthrough New Approach to Trauma Treatment

Playa del Carmen, Mexico (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Dec 15, 2023 @ 7:00 AM Eastern — Ibogaine by David Dardashti (Ibogaine Clinic Inc.), a pioneering addiction and trauma treatment center, today announced a groundbreaking approach to trauma therapy, offering new hope to individuals struggling with the often debilitating effects of deep-seated emotional trauma and PTSD.

“For years, many traditional methods of treating trauma have focused on managing symptoms rather than addressing the root cause,” says the clinic’s founder David Dardashti. “We’ve worked hard to change this narrative by introducing an innovative treatment protocol that targets the core embedded memories at the root of the trauma, bringing about profound and lasting healing.”

The Role of the Subconscious in Trauma

Trauma often resides in the subconscious, influencing behaviors and emotions in ways that are not always apparent to the individual. The facility’s approach involves helping an individual reach a state where they can access these hidden aspects of the psyche, bringing deeply repressed moments to the forefront for effective processing and resolution.

Patient-Centric and Holistic Care

At Ibogaine Clinic Inc., each patient's journey is unique. The clinic's team of experienced professionals tailors treatment plans to individual needs, ensuring a holistic approach to recovery. This personalized care extends beyond the physical aspects of trauma, encompassing emotional and spiritual healing. In total, there are over 350 unique protocols that address personal medical needs, issues such as substance abuse, specific neurological disorders, and overall health, to create a specific combination of treatments to bring about lasting results.

The Power of Ibogaine in Trauma Treatment

Central to the clinic's toolkit is the use of ibogaine, a naturally occurring psychoactive compound. Ibogaine has shown remarkable efficacy in not only treating addiction but also in facilitating deep psychological introspection and healing, making it a valuable tool in trauma therapy.

However, the correct, safe use, and the ability to leverage it to create true permanent change for the most extreme traumas, is something that the team at Ibogaine Clinic Inc. has excelled in.

Patients at Ibogaineclinic.com have reported transformative experiences, with many overcoming long-standing emotional hurdles and reclaiming control over their lives. These success stories are a testament to the clinic's commitment to providing effective and compassionate care and can be viewed on the facility’s YouTube Channel.

The clinic invites individuals grappling with the effects of trauma to explore this innovative treatment option by calling 1-800-818-4511 or filling the confidential admissions form. The clinic's approach offers more than just symptom relief; it promises a path to true healing and a brighter, more fulfilling future.
