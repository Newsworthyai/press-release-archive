# Rooted Wellness Retreats Announces 6-Day Functional Medicine Immersion in Kona, Hawaii for February 2026

Bellingham, Wa. (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Nov 13, 2025 @ 12:00 PM Pacific — Kona, Hawaii – Rooted Wellness Retreats has opened applications for its next transformational experience: a 6-day functional medicine retreat in Kona, Hawaii, running February 26 through March 3, 2026. Limited to just 12 participants, this immersive program is designed to restore the body, reignite the spirit, and reset life — not through theory, but through lived experience.

 Guests are invited to step away from routine and into a deeply restorative rhythm where every detail is handled. From chef-prepared organic meals to daily education and one-on-one care, each moment is crafted to support healing from the inside out.

 “This retreat was the reset I didn’t know I needed. I left feeling clear, energized, and truly supported,” said past participant Kaley S.

 What Participants Can Expect * Six Days, Five Nights in Paradise: Ocean-view home with pool and sauna, steps from the beach. Wake up to the sound of waves, unwind under Hawaiian sunsets.
* Root-Cause Wellness Education: Functional medicine principles simplified and taught by Lyndsay Smith, BSN RN, a medical professional with over 20 years of experience.
* Nourishment That Heals: Twelve chef-prepared organic meals designed by Chef Ty, a culinary artist and chocolate maker whose food is as restorative as it is delicious.
* Personalized Care: A private 1:1 case review with Lyndsay ensures each guest’s unique health story receives the attention it deserves.
* Somatic Support: Licensed bodyworker and spiritual teacher Jamie offers optional sessions for nervous system regulation and body-based integration.
* Stress-Free Travel: Airport pickup, drop-off, and local transportation are included. Guests simply arrive in Kona ready to heal.

 Every element of the retreat works in harmony — education, nourishment, connection, and rest — creating the conditions for vibrant health to return naturally.

 Meet the Team Lyndsay Smith, BSN RN, brings 20 years in medicine and 13 as a registered nurse to the program. With extensive training in functional medicine, nutrition, and lifestyle transformation, she now dedicates her work to helping people reverse fatigue, restore digestion, and rediscover vitality.Chef Ty designs each meal as medicine — fresh, organic, and aligned with nervous system healing, including artisan chocolate moments that spark joy.Jamie ensures guests feel grounded and supported, creating a sense of safety and calm from arrival to departure.

 Your Investment Includes * 15 hours of integrative health education
* 1:1 case review

 Rates range from $1,750–$2,550, depending on room selection. Options include king ocean-view suites, private queen rooms, shared twins, or a queen Murphy option for budget-friendly comfort.

 Airfare is not included, but shuttle service and local transport are. Roundtrip flights from Seattle to Kona are often under $400 during Black Friday sales.

 Why It Works This isn’t a lecture-based program. It’s an experience that rewires how you live, eat, rest, and think. Each day builds momentum — education in the morning, nourishment and rest in the afternoon, reflection in the evening. By the end, you feel lighter, clear-minded, and alive in your body again.

 Spots are limited to ensure depth, safety, and individualized care. Once rooms are gone, they’re gone.

 Applications are now open at RootedWellnessRetreats.org.
