# The One Plant Alliance: A New Way Forward for America’s Cannabis Future

Oakland, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Nov 13, 2025 @ 11:15 AM America/Phoenix — Today, a coalition of leaders from all cannabis sectors announces the One Plant Alliance, a unified alliance designed to heal the divisions that have fragmented America’s cannabis economy and to build one common sense, science-based regulatory future for all.

 The One Plant Alliance proposes a single policy for regulating all industry sectors—Legacy, Licensed, and Hemp—anchored by three simple, universal principles:

 * Age Verification for responsible access.
* Testing for purity and potency.
* Labeling for transparency and safety.

 This pragmatic structure, known as the Three Golden Pillars, coupled with removing “marijuana” from the schedules, establishes a level playing field that can be adopted federally and by all fifty states without new bureaucracy or costly enforcement mechanisms. By creating one consistent standard for the regulation of all cannabis products (including hemp), we will protect public health, promote entrepreneurship, and restore fairness to small farmers and businesses across the country.

 “America’s cannabis consumers don’t need a patchwork of conflicting cannabis laws,” said Steve DeAngelo, lifelong cannabis entrepreneur and activist, as well as co-founder of the One Plant Alliance (“OPA”). “What we need is one clear set of rules for all industry sectors—Licensed, Hemp and Legacy.”

 The Alliance believes this approach will protect public safety, ensure consumer confidence, open new opportunities for all industry sectors, and unleash massive market expansion. "

 “Dennis Peron and Jack Herer taught us that the cannabis plant is a bridge, not a wall—and that the needs of patients and consumers should always come first: safe, affordable, and accessible cannabis,” said Andrew DeAngelo, co-founder of OPA and a decades-long activist for cannabis reform.

 By adopting common sense, science-based standards– rather than politically motivated ones– the framework advances both public safety and economic liberty.

 “Americans should be free to make THC consumption choices without fear of the lingering consequences of prohibition, such as arrest, loss of income, loss of parental custody and more,” said Amber D. Lengacher, long-time cannabis attorney and OPA co-founder. “It’s time for all sectors of the cannabis industry–hemp, licensed, and legacy–to unite.”

 The One Plant Alliance calls on industry leaders, farmers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, scientists, and policymakers to join in supporting the OPA’s New Way Forward—a vision of one plant, one people, and one transparent and fair policy.
