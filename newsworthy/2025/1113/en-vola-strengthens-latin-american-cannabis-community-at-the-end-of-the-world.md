# En Volá Strengthens Latin American Cannabis Community at the End of the World

Ushuaia, Argentina (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Nov 13, 2025 @ 2:30 PM Eastern — En Volá, one of Latin America’s leading voices in cannabis education and culture, brought together creators, cultivators, and advocates in a landmark gathering in Ushuaia which is the southernmost city on Earth. The event celebrated the power of community, collaboration, and knowledge-sharing at the literal end of the world.

 “They say the real journey isn’t the one that takes you far, but the one that brings you closer to others,” said the En Volá team. “In Ushuaia, we felt that truth come alive. This was more than a trip, it was a collective experience where we learned, shared, and witnessed the community more alive than ever.”

 A Collective Achievement The Ushuaia gathering symbolized the strength and unity of the Latin American cannabis movement. En Volá connected with local partners and international allies who share the same purpose: cultivating knowledge, sparking dialogue, and celebrating the plant responsibly.

 The initiative was declared of regional importance by the Municipality of Ushuaia, a recognition that highlights its cultural impact. It also achieved massive organic digital reach, amplifying the voice of Latin American cannabis from Tierra del Fuego to the world.

 En Volá extended its gratitude to DC Grow Ushuaia, the Chamber of Commerce of Tierra del Fuego, and the Municipality of Ushuaia for their support and belief in the power of collaboration.

 Special Thanks to Sponsors This project was made possible through the support of brands that share En Volá’s mission to uplift cannabis culture globally:

 * Storz & Bickel, pioneers of vapor innovation, whose design and technology continue to shape the future of cannabis experiences.
* Blimburn Seeds, a global genetics leader whose dedication to cultivation culture made this journey bloom at the end of the world.
* Mary Jane Berlin, Europe’s flagship cannabis culture and activism event, bridging continents through responsible dialogue.
* Grove Bags, innovators in sustainable preservation, demonstrating that industry progress can align with environmental care.

 “These partners helped us create a cultural moment that brought people together from across continents,” said the En Volá communications team.

En Volá thanks DC Grow, Underground Capsule, Living Ushuaia, Cannelo Cooperativa, Cumelen Tours, Hotel Tierra del Fuego Ushuaia, Councilman Gabriel de la Vega, Plantagonia, and Enriqueta Lodge for their hospitality, energy, and cultural commitment.
