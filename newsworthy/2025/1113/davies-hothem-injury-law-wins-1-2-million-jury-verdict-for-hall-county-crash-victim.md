# Davies Hothem Injury Law Wins 1.2 Million Jury Verdict for Hall County Crash Victim

Gainesville, Georgia (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Nov 13, 2025 @ 7:00 AM US/Eastern — Davies Hothem Injury Law secured a $1,200,000 jury verdict in the Superior Court of Hall County for a man seriously injured in a four-vehicle collision on January 1, 2023. The defense had offered $25,000 to settle the case.

 Witnesses reported the defendant was speeding and passing in a no-passing zone before striking the rear of another vehicle at an intersection. The impact pushed that vehicle across the center line into the oncoming path of the firm’s client, causing a violent head-on collision. The defendant then left the roadway and came to rest in a ditch.

 First responders transported the client by ambulance to the emergency room. In the days that followed he developed numbness, tingling, and radiating pain through the left neck, shoulder, arm, and hand. After months of therapy he was diagnosed with neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome, a condition that can result from blunt force trauma or rapid acceleration and deceleration in motor vehicle collisions. He underwent a rib resection to decompress the injured nerves at Northeast Georgia Medical Center and later required two surgeries to repair an avulsion fracture of the thumb. Following two years of treatment and multiple surgeries, he made a full recovery.

 At trial, the defense presented a neurologist who billed more than $20,000 and claimed the client did not suffer from neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome and that surgery was unnecessary. During cross examination, Partner Kristy Davies used the neurologist’s own cited literature to undermine his conclusions and secure key admissions that other injuries were caused by the crash. Partners Dustin Davies and Kristy Davies tried the case to verdict.

 Despite medical bills of approximately $200,000, the only offer made to resolve the case was $25,000. After a week of testimony, the jury returned a 1,200,000 verdict.

 This result highlights the importance of experienced trial counsel who are prepared to challenge defense experts and present complex medical evidence clearly. Car crashes remain a leading cause of serious injury in Georgia, and speeding and aggressive driving are persistent contributors to severe collisions. For victims, the effects can last long after the initial impact.
