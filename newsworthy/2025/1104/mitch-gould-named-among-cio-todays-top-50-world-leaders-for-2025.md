Boca Raton, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Nov 4, 2025 @ 7:00 AM US/Eastern — Mitch Gould, Founder and CEO of Nutritional Products International (NPI), has been named one of CIO Today’s Top 50 World Leaders for 2025. The annual list honors global executives whose innovation, influence, and leadership are shaping the future of business, technology, and commerce.

 Gould’s feature, titled “Architect of Retail Innovation,” highlights his four-decade career transforming how consumer brands enter and thrive in the U.S. retail market.

 “It’s an honor to be recognized alongside such visionary global leaders,” said Gould. “This acknowledgment reflects the commitment of our entire NPI and InHealth Media team, who work every day to help brands succeed in the world’s most competitive retail environment.”

 A third-generation distributor, Gould’s career began by placing household brands such as Igloo, Rubbermaid, Sunbeam, and Miracle-Gro into major U.S. retailers including Home Depot, Lowe’s, Walmart, and Walgreens. He later helped pioneer Amazon’s wellness and sports nutrition categories, partnering with Muscle Foods to onboard more than 100 brands to the platform in its early years.

 Gould’s track record also includes collaborations with global icons such as Hulk Hogan, Steven Seagal, Chuck Liddell, Ronnie Coleman, and Wayne Gretzky—merging celebrity partnerships with strategic retail distribution. His upcoming memoir, The Blonde, the Ferrari, and the Kwan: The Quintessential American Success Story, chronicles these experiences while sharing lessons in resilience, entrepreneurship, and leadership.
