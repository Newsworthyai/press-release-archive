# ORGANA International Expands U.S. Reach — Coming Soon to OneLavi.com

Springville, UT (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Nov 4, 2025 @ 12:10 PM US/Mountain — ORGANA International, a pioneer in natural mineral-based wellness since 1997, announced that its products will soon be available on OneLavi.com, a leading online health and wellness retailer. The move represents another step forward in the company’s nationwide expansion, building on its recent availability on Amazon.com and growing consumer demand for natural, earth-derived supplements.

 “For nearly 30 years, ORGANA has built its reputation on honesty, purity, and effectiveness,” said Larry Mills, CEO of ORGANA International. “Our upcoming launch on OneLavi.com gives health-minded consumers another convenient way to experience the benefits of our living mineral products. It’s about accessibility — bringing natural wellness to everyone.”

 Restoring What Modern Diets Lack ORGANA International was founded by Sam Curtis, who discovered a unique method to filter decomposed plant matter containing 76 trace minerals and fulvic acid—nutrients essential to human health. Today, under the leadership of Larry Mills, ORGANA continues that mission by formulating bioavailable supplements that help replenish the minerals and nutrients often missing from modern diets due to soil depletion and over-farming.

 ORGANA’s flagship product, the Multi-Mineral Drink, delivers a balanced blend of 76 trace minerals and fulvic acid in a highly absorbable form. The brand’s broader line includes magnesium cream, liquid oxygen supplements, silver-based immune support, and Essiac tea for natural detoxification. All products are made with pharmaceutical-grade water and tested under a microscope for Brownian movement — proof that the mineral particles are still “alive” and active at the cellular level.

 Expanding Access to Natural Wellness The upcoming launch on OneLavi.com reinforces ORGANA’s commitment to expanding accessibility and reaching consumers wherever they shop for trusted wellness solutions.

 “Our customers are families, athletes, seniors — people who simply want to feel better and live healthier,” Mills added. “By bringing ORGANA to platforms like OneLavi.com, we’re continuing to make that possible.”
