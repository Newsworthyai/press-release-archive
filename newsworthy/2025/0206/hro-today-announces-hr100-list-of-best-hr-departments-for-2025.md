# HRO Today Announces HR100 List of Best HR Departments for 2025

Philadelphia, PA (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Feb 6, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Eastern — SharedXpertise Media, publishers of the award-winning HRO Today magazine, producers of the HRO Forum and Educational Events, and creators of the Baker's Dozen Customer Satisfaction Ratings for HR providers, is announcing the 2025 edition of the HR100, a data-driven ranking of the most exemplary Human Resources departments in business today.

HRO Today has annually ranked HR service providers through Baker’s Dozen Customer Satisfaction Ratings™ for nearly two decades. Its research revealed that while there are many rankings of various aspects of HR, there isn’t one definitive source of which companies are the best for human resources. Enter HRO Today’s HR100.

The HRO Today research team reviewed nearly 1,000 companies to come up with the top 100 HR departments. HRO Today’s HR100 scores and ranks HR departments in eight core areas: workplace culture, employee benefits, diversity and inclusion, employee development and talent management, human resources innovation, leadership development, talent acquisition, and employer brand. Performance in these core categories is aggregated, forming an index that provides a reasonable score for overall HR excellence.

"This year's HR100 has a lot of names we know, but also plenty of companies that aren't household names," said Elliot Clark. "What it shows is that there are HR teams in all industries, of all company sizes, doing quality work for their companies and employees."For the methodology used to create the HR100, visit HRO Today's HR100: A Ranking of the Top 100 HR Teams - HRO Today. The top 10 companies on this year's HR100 are:
