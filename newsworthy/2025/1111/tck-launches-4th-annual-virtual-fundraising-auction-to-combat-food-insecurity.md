# TCK Launches 4th Annual Virtual Fundraising Auction to Combat Food Insecurity

Truro, MA (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Nov 11, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Pacific — The Truro Community Kitchen (TCK) announces its fourth annual virtual auction, open from November 22 to December 2. This online fundraising event features an array of exciting items, including Broadway tickets, travel packages and artwork created by local Truro artisans. All proceeds directly support TCK’s mission to provide free, nutritious meals and strengthen connections at a time of growing food insecurity. A link to the auction can be found on TCK’s website at www.trurocommunitykitchen.org or at Bidding For Good.

 "TCK prides itself on delivering nutritious meals to anyone in our community, no questions asked. With rising food costs, a tight job market and reductions in federal food aid, more families and seniors than ever need assistance,” said Wendy Lurie, TCK Co-Founder and Board President. “This auction is a great way for community members to support TCK’s mission of ensuring that everyone in Truro and the Outer Cape has access to food during these increasingly challenging times - while also getting a little something in return.”

 TCK often receives heartfelt handwritten notes from meal recipients expressing gratitude for "wonderful meals, so clearly prepared and delivered with TLC." These meals, and the contact with TCK’s volunteer drivers, highlight the ways in which TCK serves as a lifeline for many residents.

 How the Auction Supports the CommunityBidders can browse and place bids on a variety of items through Bidding For Good. Proceeds from the auction go directly to TCK’s meal programs, which now also include a free monthly dinner open to anyone from Truro, Provincetown and Wellfleet, hosted at the Truro Central School.

 Beyond fundraising, the auction celebrates community spirit and mutual support. TCK encourages everyone to participate by bidding, sharing the campaign and spreading awareness about this vital initiative. TCK believes that together, we all have the ability to take action to help those experiencing hunger or social isolation.
