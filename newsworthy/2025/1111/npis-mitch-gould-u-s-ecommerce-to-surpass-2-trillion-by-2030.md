# NPI’s Mitch Gould: U.S. eCommerce to Surpass $2 Trillion by 2030

Boca Raton, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Nov 11, 2025 @ 7:00 AM US/Eastern — U.S. eCommerce market continues to expand at a record pace, driven by the convergence of mobile technology, generative AI, and new retail infrastructure designed for speed and personalization. According to Mordor Intelligence, U.S. eCommerce is projected to grow from $1.25 trillion in 2025 to $2.08 trillion by 2030, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.7 percent.

 “NPI has been at the forefront of helping brands adapt to market shifts for more than two decades,” said Mitch Gould, Founder and CEO of Nutritional Products International (NPI). “What’s happening now is not just growth in numbers — it’s a complete redefinition of how consumers discover, evaluate, and buy products. Mobile and AI are merging convenience with intelligence, and that’s changing the entire distribution playbook.”

 Mobile and AI Transform Retail Dynamics Mobile commerce now drives the majority of online checkouts in the U.S., while generative AI is improving conversion rates by aligning search intent with product discovery (Mordor Intelligence). At the same time, eCommerce sales climbed 7.5% year-over-year in 2024, reaching $1.1 trillion, and now represent 16.3% of all U.S. retail sales, according to Digital Commerce 360 and the U.S. Census Bureau.

 “Generative AI is bridging the gap between awareness and action,” Gould said. “It’s helping consumers find what they actually want — and helping brands tell their story in ways that resonate faster and more authentically.”

 The Consolidation of Retail Powerhouses Amazon remains the dominant force, holding roughly 40% of the U.S. eCommerce market, nearly triple the combined online sales of its next three competitors. Walmart is quickly closing the gap, reporting 23% year-over-year growth in online sales in 2024 and more than $120 billion in digital revenue.

 “Amazon, Walmart, and emerging players like Temu are setting the standard for logistics and personalization,” Gould noted. “But their growth also opens the door for smaller, high-quality brands that can prove readiness — from compliance to category alignment — before they go to market.”

 Strategic Readiness Defines the Next Decade Through its ‘Evolution of Distribution’ model, NPI prepares international and domestic brands to compete across both digital and physical channels. The system combines regulatory and operational readiness, retail positioning, relationship-driven introductions, and post-placement support to sustain long-term success.

 “Success in eCommerce today is about orchestration,” Gould said. “You can’t treat online and retail as separate worlds anymore. The winners are those who synchronize data, fulfillment, and storytelling across every platform consumers use.”
