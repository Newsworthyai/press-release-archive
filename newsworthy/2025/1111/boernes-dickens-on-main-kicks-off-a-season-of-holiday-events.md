This cherished tradition transforms Boerne’s famous Hill Country Mile into a vintage snowy Christmas wonderland.

 Food trucks and unique vendors of all types will be spread throughout the event. Visitors will be surprised and delighted as carolers, Victorian-themed characters and street performers entertain along Main Street.

 The following weekend, December 5 & 6, Boerne hosts a separate event, which includes the annual Weihnachts Parade on Saturday, where shops will once again stay open late as more than 100 lighted floats make their way down beautiful Main Street, and Friday’s Wassail Walk and Caroling Contest.
