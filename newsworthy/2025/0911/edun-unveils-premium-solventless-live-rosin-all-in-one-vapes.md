# Edun Unveils Premium Solventless Live Rosin All-In-One Vapes

Parachute, Colorado (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Sep 11, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Mountain — Edun, the Colorado-based cannabis company known for its regenerative cultivation practices and solventless extractions, has launched Solventless Live Rosin All-In-One Vapes. Designed for discerning consumers who value purity, potency, and flavor, these premium vapes are filled with 100% solventless live rosin extracted from flower grown in Edun’s regenerative “super natural” garden using no-till Living Soil methods.

Living Soil is the foundation of Edun’s cultivation philosophy—nurturing a biologically rich ecosystem of beneficial microbes, fungi, and organic matter that supports plant health without synthetic inputs. This approach naturally enhances terpene development and cannabinoid expression, resulting in a more vibrant, flavorful, and full-spectrum cannabis experience—from soil to cart.

Edun’s All-In-One vapes are crafted without solvents, additives or cutting agents – delivering a true-to-plant experience through advanced extraction methods that preserve the full complexity of each strain’s terpene profile. Encased in sleek, high-performance hardware and available in a potent 1000mg format, each offering highlights the distinct character of its cultivar.

“Our extraction process preserves the plant’s natural integrity, allowing each strain’s unique flavor profile and effects to truly shine,” said Jimmy Brinkerhoff, founder of Edun. “When you start with regenerative living soil, you cultivate cleaner flower—and ultimately, craft superior products. The result is a premium cannabis experience that’s as clean and complex as the plant itself.” “As a vertically integrated company, Edun controls the entire production cycle—from seed to live rosin—ensuring uncompromising quality, sustainability, and transparency at every step.” Images available at this link.
