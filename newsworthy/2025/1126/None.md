# TNT Highlights the Daily Benefits of Creapure® Creatine — Supporting Strength, Endurance, and Cognitive Health

Boca Raton, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Nov 26, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Pacific — True Nutrition Technology (TNT), the German sports nutrition brand trusted by athletes throughout Europe, announced an educational initiative highlighting the importance of daily creatine supplementation — emphasizing its role in strength, endurance, and cognitive performance.

 At the center of the announcement is TNT Creatine Monohydrate Creapure®, a 99.99% pure, ultra-fine creatine monohydrate powder produced exclusively in Germany under the strictest quality controls.

 “Creatine isn’t just for bodybuilders — it’s one of the most researched and beneficial daily supplements for general health,” said Markus Himmelstoss, Managing Director of True Nutrition Technology. “From energy production to mental performance, endurance, and healthy aging, creatine supports every cell in the body. That’s why we use Creapure®—the purest creatine in the world.”

 Why Daily Creatine Matters — Beyond the Gym While creatine is best known for improving strength and muscle performance, new research continues to show benefits far beyond athletic performance:

 * Cognitive Health & Mental Performance: Creatine supports ATP production in brain cells, helping improve focus, memory, and mental clarity — especially during stress, fatigue, or sleep deprivation.

 * Healthy Aging & Muscle Preservation: Studies show daily creatine intake enhances the effects of strength training in adults over 55 and helps maintain functional strength.

 * Endurance & Energy Levels: Creatine acts as an energy buffer, helping sustain performance across high-intensity intervals, athletics, and everyday physical tasks.

 * Vegan & Plant-Forward Diets: Because creatine is naturally found only in meat and fish, TNT’s supplement is ideal for vegans and those who consume limited animal protein.

 German-Made Purity: Creapure® at Its Highest Standard TNT uses Creapure®, a patented German raw material manufactured by AlzChem — widely recognized as the highest-purity creatine monohydrate in the world.

 Key Quality Advantages of TNT Creapure® Creatine: * Manufactured in Germany under IFS-certified facilities
* 99.99% purity — free of impurities and contaminants
* Micronized for superior solubility and absorption
* 100% vegan formula
* Regularly tested by an external laboratory for microbiological safety
* Available as capsules or powder

 TNT Creatine Monohydrate is tested rigorously to ensure consistent purity, solubility, and safety — exceeding typical global supplement manufacturing standards.

 Daily Use Made Simple TNT recommends 5g of creatine per day, with no cycling required. Creatine stores water inside muscle cells — increasing volume and performance, not subcutaneous water retention.

 “Creatine is one of the safest, most researched supplements ever created,” Himmelstoss added. “We’re proud to offer a German-made product of unparalleled purity that athletes, fitness enthusiasts, and everyday individuals can trust for long-term use.”
