# Breaking New Study: mRNA Vaccines Trigger 620% Heart Risk Surge in Young Men

Washington, DC (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Apr 14, 2025 @ 10:22 AM Eastern — A groundbreaking new study published in the International Journal of Cardiovascular Research & Innovation is sounding alarms about the safety of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, directly challenging claims from public health officials and raising urgent questions about transparency and trust. Using hard data from disease trends, patient outcomes, and immune system analysis from multiple research reports, the study reveals that heart inflammation risks tied to the vaccines may be far greater—and more dangerous—than previously reported, particularly among young men, shaking confidence in official narratives.

For example, South Korea’s massive 4.5 million-person study found a stunning 620% spike in myocarditis risk and a 175% jump in pericarditis risk after mRNA vaccination. That’s not a typo—six times the normal rate of heart inflammation, often hitting within days of the shot. Chest pain, racing hearts, and crippling fatigue are just the start—many cases morph into “myopericarditis,” a dangerous combination of heart and sac inflammation confirmed by MRI scans. Young men under 40, especially teens aged 12-24, are up to seven times more likely to exhibit these symptoms than girls their age.

These findings also paint a stark picture: the public may have been misled about the true costs of these vaccines. “Our findings demand a hard look at what we’ve been told,” said Dr. Kirk Milhoan, IMA Senior Fellow, Pediatric Cardiology and one of the study’s authors. “Transparency is non-negotiable when lives are at stake.”

“To get your papers published, you’ve had to say ‘safe and effective’ over and over, and that’s a real problem in our field,” added Jessica Rose, IMA Senior Fellow, Computational Biology and one of the study’s authors. “It’s shocking. People need to understand the dangers here. Political correctness has no place in medicine.”The study’s bombshell conclusions specifically debunk three major claims pushed by health agencies:

1. Vaccines Cause More Heart Issues Than the Virus: Contrary to assurances that COVID-19 infections posed a bigger threat for myocarditis (heart inflammation), the study shows mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna may trigger more cases than the virus itself, including during Omicron waves.
2. Heart Risks Aren’t “Mild” or “Rare”: Health officials called vaccine-related myocarditis mild, short-lived, and uncommon. The study counters that these cases can be severe, long-lasting, and more frequent, with potential for lasting heart damage in some patients.
3. Risks Outweigh Benefits: Agencies insisted the vaccines’ benefits far outweigh any downsides. The researchers argue the opposite, pointing to a higher-than-expected toll of vaccine-related harm that calls the ongoing push for mRNA shots into serious question.

This revelation lands as Americans grapple with growing distrust in institutions, from government to Big Pharma, including revelations that high-ranking CDC personnel may have deleted critical mRNA injury data. The study calls for immediate scrutiny of vaccine policies and a renewed focus on individual choice in healthcare decisions.

Heart Risks Much Higher than Previously Reported; Younger Men Bear the Brunt of Growing Crisis

“Any doctor who has practiced medicine for any reasonable amount of time will view these findings as a major alarm. The continued use of mRNA risks generational harm to the American people.” – Dr. Kirk MilhoanAbout Dr. Kirk Milhoan
