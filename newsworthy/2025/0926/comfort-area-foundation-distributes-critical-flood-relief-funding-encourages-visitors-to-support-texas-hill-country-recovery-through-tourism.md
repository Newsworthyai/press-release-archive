# Comfort Area Foundation Distributes Critical Flood Relief Funding, Encourages Visitors to Support Texas Hill Country Recovery Through Tourism

Comfort, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Sep 26, 2025 @ 10:00 AM Pacific — Following the devastating July 4th flooding in the Texas Hill Country, the Comfort Area Foundation (CAF) announced they have mobilized critical resources to the community in the form of financial funding raised through grants and fundraising activities. Distribution of funding is the first step in the ongoing recovery of small businesses in the areas devastated by the July flooding.

Thanks to the generosity of donors and two grants awarded by the Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country, more than $442,000 was raised and deployed directly into the community. These Funds provided assistance to 93 local businesses, 78 property owners and families most impacted by the flooding.

“The response from our community and our partners demonstrates the strength and resilience of the Greater Comfort Region,” said Chris Havens, President at the Comfort Area Foundation. “These funds represent more than financial assistance for residents of Center Point, Comfort, Waring, and Sisterdale, they represent hope, stability and the commitment we share to stand together during times of crisis.”Now that the rebuilding efforts are in full swing, CAF invites visitors to return to the region to help support local businesses, restaurants and nonprofits that continue to drive recovery and revitalization of the affected community. Support through tourism will be the next step in the process of helping to rebuild communities.

“Support small businesses and local nonprofits that continue to support the Hill Country Region. Without the traditional summer tourism in the region, the long-term recovery includes a significant need for weekend tourism and local shopping to return to the Greater Comfort region," Havens said when asked how people can best support the region through the next phase of recovery.As communities across the affected areas reopen, supporting Texas Hill Country tourism and local commerce remains vital to ensuring the region continues to thrive for generations to come. Every visit, purchase and engagement with local businesses and nonprofits directly contributes to the resilience and sustainability of the Texas Hill Country.

Additionally, Rebuild Kerr has released vital public data which is available through their Central Texas Flood Needs Assessment for those interested in what is needed within the affected communities.

Looking ahead to the future, visitors and residents are invited to explore the Comfort Vision 2050 document, which captures the collective voice and priorities of the Hill Country community prior to 2019. The plan highlights key areas such as flood mitigation, TXDOT safety planning, and continued economic diversification.
