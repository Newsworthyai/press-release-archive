# New Year's Comedy Show in NYC at the Comedy Village

NEW YORK, NY (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Dec 16, 2025 @ 3:00 PM Eastern — Every New Year’s Eve, more than 1 million people flood into Times Square to wait for the ball drop. Once inside the viewing zones, people are required to stand for hours. They cannot sit, eat, drink alcohol, or access public bathrooms. If they leave their assigned area, they are not allowed back in.

 ComedyVillage.com is offering a simpler option, just a four-minute walk from the heart of Times Square.

 Comedy Village Times Square will host two New Year’s Eve comedy shows on December 31, with showtimes at 8:00 PM and 10:00 PM. Guests can enjoy a reserved seat, indoor restrooms, food and drinks, and a warm space to celebrate before heading back outside to take in the New Year’s energy.

 The 8:00 PM show runs from 8:00 to 9:30 PM and is ideal for guests who want to enjoy a full comedy experience before exploring Times Square later in the night.

 The 10:00 PM show runs from 10:00 to 11:30 PM and includes a built-in New Year’s countdown. The show pauses shortly before midnight so guests can celebrate the moment together indoors.

 Tickets are $50 per person for the 8 p.m. show and $65 per person for the 10 p.m. show. To purchase tickets, visit ComedyVillage or call (347) 788-1781.

 Each show will feature the city's top comedic talent, including Dante Nero seen on NBC's Blacklist and "Chappelle Show", Eagle Witt from MTV's "Wild 'N Out", PJ Landers seen on Netflix. Guests attending the 10 p.m. show will ring in midnight from inside the club and can watch the ball drop live on the club’s multiple monitors. After the ball drops, guests will be allowed to enter Times Square to enjoy the electric energy at The Crossroads of the World.

 Party favors will be provided, and a complimentary champagne toast will be offered at the close of the 10 p.m. show, just before midnight.

 We’re thrilled to be back for our second New Year’s Eve in Times Square, and the excitement is bigger than ever,” says PJ Landers, Comedy Village owner and comedian.“ There’s nothing like celebrating the biggest night of the year just a block from the ball drop. We can’t wait to welcome guests for a night filled with laughter, community, and everything that makes New York the greatest city in the world.

 “If you are coming to Times Square, you might as well be comfortable” said PJ Landers, owner of Comedy Village. “You can get food, drinks, a great comedy show and clean restrooms. Then step right back into the New Year’s atmosphere without giving up your entire night.”

 Comedy Village is located at 352 West 44th Street, placing guests close enough to experience the excitement of Times Square without dealing with the strict street-level restrictions.

 Tickets are available now, and both shows are expected to sell out.
