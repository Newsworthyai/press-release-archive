# Mayor Javier Villalobos Highlights McAllen’s Economic Strength, Regional Collaboration, and Border Advantage on The Building Texas Show

McAllen, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Dec 16, 2025 @ 12:05 PM US/Central — In a new episode of The Building Texas Show, host Justin McKenzie sits down with McAllen Mayor Javier Villalobos for an in-depth conversation on why McAllen has emerged as one of Texas’ most stable, collaborative, and economically resilient border cities .

 Now serving his second term, Mayor Villalobos traces his path from municipal law to city leadership and explains the unique, often misunderstood role of a Texas mayor. While the position is unpaid, Villalobos describes it as a full-time commitment centered on stewardship, visibility, and economic diplomacy — particularly across the U.S.–Mexico border.

 Throughout the episode, Villalobos challenges national narratives about border cities by sharing hard data and on-the-ground realities. McAllen ranks among the safest cities in the United States, maintains one of the lowest costs of living in Texas, and has become a top destination for small business growth, conventions, and cross-border commerce. He emphasizes that McAllen functions as the economic engine of the Rio Grande Valley, supporting a regional workforce that transcends city boundaries.

 A central theme of the discussion is collaboration. Villalobos explains how cities across the Rio Grande Valley — McAllen, Edinburg, Pharr, Mission, Brownsville, Harlingen, and beyond — have shifted from competition to coordination. This regional mindset, combined with strong partnerships with Hidalgo, Cameron, and Starr counties, has positioned South Texas to capitalize on major investments such as SpaceX, advanced manufacturing, logistics, and international trade.

 Education and workforce development also take center stage. Villalobos points to institutions like UTRGV, Texas A&M–RGV, and South Texas College as critical pipelines for skilled talent in welding, advanced manufacturing, healthcare, and technical trades. With one of the youngest populations in Texas, McAllen is investing deliberately in human capital to support long-term economic growth.

 The mayor also outlines McAllen’s disciplined financial strategy, noting more than 130 days of working capital in reserves and consecutive property tax rate reductions. Major projects discussed include the redevelopment of a 70-acre reservoir into a mixed-use destination, expansion of the McAllen Convention Center, and the opening of a full cargo facility at the international bridge — all designed to grow sales tax revenue, tourism, and global connectivity.

 As the conversation turns toward 2026, Villalobos expresses optimism about McAllen’s future, citing fiscal strength, strategic incentives for value-add manufacturing, and the city’s unique position between two of the world’s most powerful economies.

 “McAllen sits at the center of a fluid, working border,” Villalobos explains in the episode. “That collaboration — locally, regionally, and internationally — is what makes this city strong.”

 The episode also highlights McAllen’s community-driven quality of life, from large-scale holiday events like the South Pole of Texas and the McAllen Holiday Parade to year-round tourism and convention activity that continues to attract first-time visitors.

 The Building Texas Show is a statewide multimedia platform hosted by Justin McKenzie, focused on telling the stories of Texas communities, civic leaders, and economic builders shaping the state’s future.
