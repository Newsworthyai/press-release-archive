# Skills Frameworks Are Key to Unlocking Talent Mobility Success - Study by HR Research Institute in Partnership with SHL

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Jun 23, 2025 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — A newly released research report from the HR Research Institute, in partnership with SHL, reveals a clear differentiator between thriving internal mobility programs and those that underperform: a strong, structured skills framework.

The study, titled “Talent Mobility Programs 2025,” explores how organizations are tackling the complexities of internal mobility and what sets high-impact programs apart. While the majority of organizations recognize the value of internal mobility—54% of HR professionals report noticeable improvements in retention and business outcomes—few have the infrastructure in place to realize its full potential.

One standout finding from the report: organizations that assess both employee skills and job requirements are significantly better positioned to match people to opportunities—quickly and at scale. However, more than half of respondents say translating and measuring skills using their current frameworks is “somewhat” or “very” challenging, often due to bloated skill libraries or unclear role profiles.

While talent mobility has significantly improved retention and performance, execution remains a hurdle. Only 8% say they have a concise, easy-to-use skills framework—an essential enabler of successful mobility. The most common barriers include managers prioritizing external hires (33%), limited budgets (28%), and outdated technology (18%).

Despite the clear benefits, many organizations still lack the infrastructure to scale internal talent strategies. To close the gap, HR leaders should embed mobility into their core talent strategy, train managers on the business value of internal advancement, invest in scalable technology, and refine skills frameworks for clarity and actionability.

“Reskilling and internal mobility go hand in hand,” says Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator and CEO of HR.com. “But without a clear, structured view of employee skills and job needs, even the best intentions fall flat. This study shows that skills frameworks may be the connective tissue organizations need to execute on mobility effectively.”[DOWNLOAD REPORT]
