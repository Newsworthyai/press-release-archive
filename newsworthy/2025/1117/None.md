# Alamo Unveils the Alamo Promenade: A New Gateway Connecting Texas Heritage and San Antonio’s Future

San Antonio, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Nov 17, 2025 @ 7:00 AM US/Central — The Alamo will celebrate the grand opening of the Alamo Promenade, a welcoming gateway to the Alamo grounds that features statues honoring key historical figures and shaded seating areas.

 The Promenade will create a sense of arrival from Commerce Street onto the historic site by converting a traditional street into a pedestrian-friendly walkway. The statues will lead toward the nearby Briscoe Western Art Museum, creating a powerful connection between two cultural destinations.

 This event, called "Happy Trails," will also be the culmination of the Alamo Statewide Stampede where we will announce the winning counties of the fundraising challenge issued earlier this year. The friendly competition encouraged all Texans to preserve Texas history by giving back to the Alamo. It will be judged on a per capita basis - even the smallest county can win!

 "Happy Trails" will take place next Friday, November 21, at 11 a.m. on Plaza de Valero, the Alamo's public greenspace in front of the historic Menger Hotel.

 Speakers will include Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick and Alamo Trust, Inc., President and CEO Hope Andrade. Together, they will cut the ribbon on a new chapter of the Alamo's 300-year history.

 The Building Texas Show is a proud supporter of the Alamo Promenade project and the vision it represents for Texas. As a statewide platform dedicated to telling the stories of Texas communities, The Building Texas Show celebrates how the Promenade strengthens the bridge between Texas heritage and the future of San Antonio and the state as a whole. The project exemplifies the ongoing work to honor the past while shaping a more connected, vibrant, and forward-looking Texas.
