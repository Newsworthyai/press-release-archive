# Lionheart Health and ElectroMedical Technologies Announce Joint Venture in Accelerated Wound Healing

Mission Viejo, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Mar 25, 2025 @ 3:15 PM Pacific — Two industry innovation leaders have teamed up to transform the field of accelerated wound healing. The Lionheart Health, Inc. and ElectroMedical Technologies (OTC:EMED) joint venture combines Lionheart Health's patented bioelectric signaling software for regeneration and accelerated healing with ElectroMed's advanced device technology platform. This partnership is intended to make great leap strides in addressing critical patient needs such as avoiding limb amputation by significantly enhancing treatment outcomes in wound care.

Lionheart Health, Inc. is a spin out of Leonhardt Ventures LLC known for over 4 decades of breakthrough innovations in healthcare. Over 600,000 patients have been treated with Leonhardt inventions that generated over $2 billion in annual revenues for licensees and acquirers in 2024 alone.

Matthew Wolfson, CEO of ElectroMed Technologies, stated, "By integrating Lionheart Health's patented bioelectric accelerated healing protein expressions and our first in class device technology, we have created the ultimate accelerated wound healing solution that we believe is destined to transform patient wound care forward for the next 100 years. The encouraging results from our respective initial tests are a testament to the potential of this partnership. We believe this technology may contribute most in treating diabetic ulcers."A Partnership of Continued Research and Commercialization

Following the promising safety and efficacy outcomes of pilot studies of both firms' wound healing products the joint venture is preparing to launch new combination clinical studies. The intended aim of these new studies is to significantly accelerate complete healing and long term outcomes in wound management and to prevent limb amputations.

A new planned wound care clinical study will have these arms (about to be submitted for independent IRB approval):

1. Bioelectric stimulation alone.

2. Bioelectric stimulation + bioelectric enhanced Super PRF TM.

3. Bioelectric stimulation + bioelectric enhanced Super PRF TM + amniotic sourced membrane grafts

4. All of the above (3) + stromal fraction derived from adipose tissue injections or klotho expressing stem cells (where available).

* PRF centrifuges for this study will be provided by BioPRF Florida https://bio-prf.com
* Adipose tissue processing devices will be provided by SynovaLife Pasadena https://www.synovalife.com

Lionheart Health-ElectroMed 240 Stimulator

In previous stand-alone pilot studies completed in patients with non-healing wounds on the soon to be amputated list in The Czech Republic, Mexico and the USA > 90% of limbs treated were saved.

Lionheart Health, Inc. has over 500 patent claims related to bioelectric protein expressions, tissue regeneration and accelerated healing. Electromedical Technologies founded in 2007 has over 18 years' experience developing and manufacturing electrical stimulation devices for treating pain and inflammation and other related disorders. The two organizations have a shared vision of enhancing patient outcomes in wound care and reducing long term care and lost opportunity costs for society. There are 185,000 amputations in the USA every year, most of them related to non-healing wounds, and this joint venture team has a goal to cut that by more than 1/2 within the decade.

Lionheart Health, Inc. is in the process of opening up, primarily via licensing, 124 clinics worldwide that will be trained and certified to practice their patented bioelectric treatment protocols. The plan is to make this wound care technology available to qualified clinics as an add on module license. The joint venture will receive 7% gross sales royalty on each patient service.
