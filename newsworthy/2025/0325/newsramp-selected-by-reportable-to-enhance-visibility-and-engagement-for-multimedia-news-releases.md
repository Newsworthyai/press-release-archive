# NewsRamp Selected by Reportable to Enhance Visibility and Engagement for Multimedia News Releases

Boerne, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Mar 25, 2025 @ 6:00 AM Pacific — NewsRamp.com, a media technology platform that amplifies press release visibility and engagement, has been selected by Reportable, a leading communication platform, to boost the reach and impact of its clients’ news announcements.

This partnership leverages NewsRamp’s advanced distribution capabilities to ensure Reportable’s clients achieve maximum visibility and engagement in today’s competitive digital landscape.

The press release distribution landscape is rapidly evolving, driven by changing SEO algorithms, duplicate content penalties, and the rise of AI-driven search trends. NewsRamp addresses these challenges by transforming press releases into unique, multi-modal content.—including news articles, blog posts, persona-based TLDRs, videos, audio, and Zero-Click Marketing assets—and syndicating them across its proprietary network of websites, social platforms, podcasts, newsletters, and forums.

“We partnered with NewsRamp to enhance our content syndication and amplification offerings,” said Tom Baker, co-founder of Reportable. “This collaboration ensures our clients can cut through the noise and deliver news that resonates with their audiences.”“We recognize that content publishers may not have the resources or technical expertise to keep pace with advancements in AI and large language models,” explains David McInnis, founder of [NewsRamp.com](http://newsramp.com/) and PRWeb. “With [NewsRamp.com](http://newsramp.com/), newswires and content publishers gain access to a team continuously developing pioneering solutions for news distribution.”“Most internet activity happens outside of search,” added Mark M. Willaman, co-founder of NewsRamp. “By distributing releases in multiple formats across diverse platforms, NewsRamp ensures news surfaces organically where audiences spend their time.”Key Benefits of NewsRamp Distribution:
