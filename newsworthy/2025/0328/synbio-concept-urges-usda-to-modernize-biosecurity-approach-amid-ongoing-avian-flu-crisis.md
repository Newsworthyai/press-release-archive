# Synbio Concept Urges USDA to Modernize Biosecurity Approach Amid Ongoing Avian Flu Crisis

Washington DC (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Mar 28, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Central — With over 166 million birds culled since 2022 and egg prices skyrocketing 237%, the U.S. poultry industry remains in crisis. While the USDA has allocated $500M to biosecurity efforts, current reactive measures, which are focused on culling and short-lived chemical disinfection, fail to provide lasting protection. Synbio Concept is calling for a shift toward microbiome-based biosecurity solutions that support long-term environmental stability and disease prevention.

"Right now, biosecurity in the U.S. is defined by what we react to, rather than what we prevent," said KristyPhillips, founder and managing partner of Synbio Concept. "We have the tools to help poultry farms build microbial resilience rather than simply resetting surfaces after every outbreak. The USDA has an opportunity to lead this shift."A Smarter Approach to BiosecurityCurrent biosecurity methods rely heavily on chemical disinfectants that degrade within hours, leaving farms vulnerable to rapid recontamination. Synbio Concept’s 4-Layer Defense System applies microbiome science to all critical vectors of disease spread:

* Air Quality: Synbiotic fogging reduces airborne pathogen loads and ammonia levels.
* Water Systems: Probiotic water treatments improve hydration and break down biofilms.
* Food & Gut Health: Pre- and Probiotics supports microbial balance and overall cleanliness, which can contribute to improved farm management practices.
* Manure & Waste: Microbial stabilizers lower moisture and cross-contamination risks.

"Poultry farmers are on the front lines of this crisis, and they need solutions that work beyond a single cleaning cycle," said Michael Alonzo, Chief Operations Officer. "Probiotic biosecurity is a cost-effective, scalable approach that aligns with USDA’s funding priorities while reducing reliance on chemicals."A Call for USDA ActionSynbio Concept proposes a 6-12 month federally backed pilot program to integrate microbiome-based cleaning into poultry biosecurity protocols. The initiative would cover 100-500 farms with USDA-funded cost-sharing to drive adoption and data collection.

"If we take national security seriously, we must ‘Provide for the Common Defense’—not just against foreign threats, but against preventable biological crises," Kristy Phillips added. "The USDA has the funding. Now it’s time to act."For more information, to request a pilot, or to speak with a Synbio specialist, visit: https://synbioconcept.com
