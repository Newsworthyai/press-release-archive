# HR.com Launches New Program to Boost Visibility for HR Consultants

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday May 27, 2025 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — HR.com, the world’s largest community of human resources professionals, is excited to unveil a new subscription-based HR consultant branding program, designed specifically to give HR consultants an affordable and powerful multifaceted strategy to elevate their visibility, build brand authority, and connect directly with HR leaders actively seeking guidance, content, and solutions.

With three levels of brand-building subscriptions to choose from, participants earn reward points through active engagement—contributing insights and connecting with the HR community across multiple channels. These rewards are applied to lowering their subscription costs.

With a community of over 2 million HR professionals, HR.com offers this new option for consultants across all HR disciplines—recruitment, talent management, employee benefits, compliance, learning and development, HR tech, and more—to showcase their expertise and expand their reach in the HR industry. The newly expanded branding and advertising options give these thought leaders the chance to position themselves as trusted experts while helping HR professionals navigate the complex challenges of today’s workplace.

By subscribing, consultants can:

* Build authority via event speaking opportunities, publishing trusted content through HR.com’s platform, and being featured in HR Excellence magazines
* Boost their name recognition and grow their networks
* Send InMails to HR.com members (number varies by subscription level)
