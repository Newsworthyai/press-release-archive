Round Rock, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Oct 13, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Central — Winner of Best of Round Rock 2024 Award Continues to Raise the Standard in Home Care

A Place At Home – North Austin is honored to announce its nomination for the 2025 Best of Round Rock award in the Senior Care Services category. This recognition follows the community’s overwhelming support that led the home care agency’s win in 2024. The locally owned agency proudly serves seniors, veterans, and adults with disabilities across the North Austin area.

Senior care expert and owner Stacey Eisenberg expressed deep appreciation for the community’s continued trust.

“Being nominated again means everything to us. Our families know we don’t just send caregivers to fill a schedule—we build relationships. Every match we make is thoughtful and personal because real care starts with connection. We’re on a mission to put the care back in caregiving, and this nomination tells us it’s making a difference. We’re so grateful that Round Rock sees the heart behind what we do,” said Eisenberg.
