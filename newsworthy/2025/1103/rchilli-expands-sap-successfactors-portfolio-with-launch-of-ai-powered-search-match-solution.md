# RChilli Expands SAP SuccessFactors Portfolio with Launch of AI-Powered Search &amp; Match Solution

San Ramon, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Nov 3, 2025 @ 10:30 AM America/Phoenix — RChilli, a global leader in intelligent recruitment automation, today announced the addition of —Search & Match—to its SAP SuccessFactors integration suite. Designed for modern enterprises, this AI-driven solution brings unparalleled precision, speed, and intelligence to candidate-job matching workflows inside SAP SuccessFactors.

 This latest enhancement empowers recruiters to automate the once-manual process of extracting candidate data, ranking, and searching resumes against job descriptions. By offering full support for resume and job ingestion via email and browser extensions, along with a real-time, custom-weighted scoring engine, Search & Match helps SAP SuccessFactors customers shorten time-to-hire and elevate hiring accuracy.

 “In today’s competitive hiring landscape, recruiters don’t just need more candidates—they need better matches,” said Vinod Kumar Bhardwaj, CTO at RChilli. “Our Search & Match AI solution ensures that recruiters using SAP SuccessFactors can identify the right talent faster, more accurately, and at scale—all while staying compliant with global data standards.”

 Transforming Talent Matching with Intelligent Automation Our Search & Match supports seamless ingestion of resumes and job descriptions through either email or browser extension, features already trusted in RChilli Email Importer and Browser Assistant. Once data is added, the AI-powered engine instantly extracts candidate data and standardizes it using RChilli proprietary taxonomy for skills, experience, job roles, and education.

 From there, recruiters can:

 * Get matching candidates from both the applied candidates and the existing talent pool.
* Add candidates and job profile via email or browser extension
* AI -powered search through thousands of profiles using weighted search parameters.
* View match scores with a detailed breakdown for complete hiring transparency.

 This intelligent, automated process replaces guesswork with data-backed fitment, allowing hiring teams to focus on strategic decisions rather than manual screening.

 Built with Enterprise-Grade Compliance and Trust As with all RChilli products, the Search & Match module is backed by the company’s robust commitment to security and data privacy. It adheres to global compliance standards, including ISO 27001:2022, SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA, and NYC AEDT. Importantly, RChilli ensures no candidate data is stored post-processing, aligning with strict enterprise and regional data protection norms.

 With talent shortages intensifying and recruitment cycles tightening, Search & Match addresses critical pain points for HR decision-makers: reducing time-to-hire, improving candidate quality, and minimizing compliance risks. For HRIS teams and operations leaders, the integration means reduced manual effort, improved system accuracy, and enhanced recruiter productivity.
