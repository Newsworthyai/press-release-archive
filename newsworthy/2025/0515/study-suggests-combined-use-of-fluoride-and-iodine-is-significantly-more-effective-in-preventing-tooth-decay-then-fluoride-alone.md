# Study Suggests Combined Use of Fluoride and Iodine Is Significantly More Effective in Preventing Tooth Decay Then Fluoride Alone

Boynton Beach, FL (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday May 15, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Eastern — Tooth decay remains one of the most widespread chronic health conditions globally, affecting individuals of all ages. While fluoride has long been recognized for its ability to strengthen enamel and prevent cavities, a recent study published in the International Journal of Clinical Pediatric Dentistry (2020;13(5):559–565)* highlights the enhanced benefits of combining fluoride and iodine to improve oral health and proactively reduce the incidence of cavities.

The study aimed to determine whether adding iodine to traditional fluoride treatments could further reduce tooth decay. Researchers also examined the impact on bacteria commonly linked to cavities, including Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus.

Researchers reviewed several prior clinical trials from reputable medical databases involving children aged 1 to 12. Seven studies met the researchers' criteria, of which four were selected for further in-depth analysis. The quality of each study was carefully evaluated, and statistical tools were used to ensure accuracy.

The analysis revealed that children who received the combined fluoride and iodine treatment developed significantly fewer new cavities than those treated with fluoride alone. While no significant difference was found in post-treatment levels of Streptococcus mutans, the results suggest a promising benefit to using both agents together. The authors suggested additional clinical trials to confirm these early findings and to shape future dental care recommendations.

“This dual-therapy approach is an important step forward in dental care for all ages,” said Dr. Herb Moskowitz, DDS, Chairman of Iotech International. “As a leading developer and manufacturer of oral care products using molecular iodine technology, we understand the powerful role molecular iodine can play in oral health. Its natural antimicrobial properties help reduce harmful bacteria in the mouth. Studies have shown that tooth decay cannot form in the absence of decay-causing bacteria. Independent testing confirms that Strep mutans, the principal cavity-causing bacterium, is completely destroyed by molecular iodine within 15 seconds. When used together with fluoride, they have the potential to significantly and safely enhance cavity prevention efforts.”Dr. Moskowitz further explained that molecular iodine (I₂) stands out among iodine forms due to its broad-spectrum antimicrobial action and low toxicity. “Unlike other iodine compounds, molecular iodine effectively disrupts harmful oral bacteria like Streptococcus mutans without staining, harming healthy tissue or promoting resistance,” he said. “Other studies have shown that molecular iodine helps prevent plaque buildup.”

The ioTech Chairman’s remarks coincide with the release of the company’s new oral rinse, ioRinse™ AC, a first-of-its-kind, advanced formula containing fluoride and molecular iodine. ioRinse™ AC incorporates the most recent research findings designed to make it the most effective and safest to use anti-cavity rinse available.

“Daily oral hygiene is essential for maintaining dental health, and oral rinsing plays a crucial role in this routine,” said Dr. Moskowitz. ioRinse™ AC is available on Amazon.com or directly from ioTech International at www.iotechinternational.com.
