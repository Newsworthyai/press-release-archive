Reflecting on the significance of the Ice Ball event, Vice President of Cowboy Auctioneer, Emily Hardt, shared her perspective, stating, "Ice Ball is one of Austin's premier events and it's so encouraging to watch the community come together in support of a truly life-changing mission. Big Brothers Big Sisters mentors encourage, empower, and ultimately support their littles in reaching their full potential. These children are the future of our community and it's an honor to be a part of a mission that is shaping who they become."

The 2025 Ice Ball is set to commemorate over two decades of Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central Texas' dedication to providing mentorship opportunities for the youth in the region.
