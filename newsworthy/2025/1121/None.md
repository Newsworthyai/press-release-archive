# Bringing the Bakersfield Sound Back to Texas Dance Halls

Albert, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Nov 21, 2025 @ 8:00 AM US/Central — The Building Texas Show has released a new episode featuring Zane Adamo, frontman and fiddle player for The Soda Crackers, a Bakersfield, California band reviving the storied Bakersfield Sound and reconnecting it with its Texas roots. The episode, now live on YouTube, highlights the band’s recent Texas–Oklahoma tour, their musical heritage, and their much-anticipated debut album launching December 1, 2025.

 In the conversation, filmed shortly after the band’s performance at Albert Dancehall in Albert, Texas, host Justin McKenzie explores how The Soda Crackers have embraced Texas dance hall culture—an environment where the Bakersfield Sound naturally belongs.

 A Historic Texas Dance Hall Welcomes a New Generation of Western Swing Albert Dancehall, a restored 1920s venue located between Stonewall and Blanco, served as a perfect backdrop for the interview. Its weathered wood stage, family-friendly atmosphere, and loyal community of dancers mirror the spaces where Western Swing and early honky-tonk music once thrived.

 Zane recalls the night at Albert as a powerful reminder of why these halls still matter: multi-generational families dancing together, young children twirling between boot-stomping regulars, and a crowd that truly understands the roots of the music. “The music we play is meant for dancing,” Adamo says in the episode. “It came from people who worked hard, lived through the Dust Bowl, and wanted a great time on a Friday night.”

 Honoring the Bakersfield–Texas Connection Though known as “California country,” the Bakersfield Sound was shaped heavily by Texans and Oklahomans who migrated west during the Dust Bowl. Buck Owens, originally from Sherman, Texas, and Tommy Collins, born in Oklahoma City, helped define a style of music that blended honky-tonk grit, country swing, and dance hall energy.

 Zane and The Soda Crackers are committed to reviving that lineage. Their Texas-Oklahoma tour included stops at iconic venues such as the Broken Spoke in Austin, historic dance halls, and even a pilgrimage to Turkey, Texas—home of Bob Wills and the annual Bob Wills Day celebration.

 Debut Album Releasing December 1, 2025 The Soda Crackers’ upcoming self-titled album, releasing December 1, 2025, will feature:

 * 10 tracks, including 6 original songs written by current and former band members
* 4 classic covers honoring the Bakersfield Sound
* Available on all major streaming platforms
* A limited-edition vinyl pressing, including a special color variant for collectors

 “Capturing the classic spirit is incredibly important to us,” Adamo noted. “From instrumentals to dance-hall-driven arrangements, we want this album to feel like it belongs on a stage in Texas.”

 Celebrating Texas Dance Hall Heritage McKenzie and Adamo close the episode by highlighting the urgent need to support historic dance halls across Texas—many of which are disappearing in places like Bakersfield. Venues such as Albert Dancehall stand as living reminders of the state’s cultural heritage, where community, music, and history come together on a wooden floor.

 “This band is helping rebuild that bridge between Texas and Bakersfield,” McKenzie said. “Dance halls like Albert are where that story comes alive.”
