# HR Must Secure a Seat at the Strategy Table to Drive Business Success - New Study by HR Research Institute

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Mar 10, 2025 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — HR.com today announced the release of its latest research report, HR.com’s Future of HR Skills and Strategies 2025, providing a comprehensive look at the evolving role of HR in strategic business operations. The report reveals that when HR is empowered with a seat at the strategic table, organizations tend to reap more significant benefits.

Organizations with robust HR strategies are emerging as industry leaders, as they are:

* nearly seven times more likely to allocate substantial time to strategic planning and implementation
* more than twice as likely to view HR as an equal partner in these processes.

Despite this growing recognition of HR as a strategic asset, significant skill gaps persist. In fact, only 38% of HR professionals currently rate their expertise as expert-level. Critical areas for improvement include leveraging HR data and analytics, facilitating change, and thinking strategically:

* Gap 46 points: While 80% of respondents acknowledge that HR data and analytics are essential or important, just 34% believe that HR demonstrates the necessary proficiency in this area.
* Gap 42 points: Even though 89% view the ability to facilitate change as critical, only 47% consider HR to be proficient or highly proficient in driving change.
* Gap 41 points: An overwhelming 92% recognize the importance of strategic thinking, yet merely 51% feel that HR has achieved a high level of proficiency in this key competency.

“Our findings underscore the urgent need for HR leaders to not only adapt but also to lead transformational change within their organizations,” said Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator and CEO of HR.com. “Bridging these skill gaps will be pivotal in ensuring both HR and overall business success.”

The full research report, HR.com’s Future of HR Skills and Strategies 2025, is available for free download and offers a detailed look at strategies to help HR professionals develop the right competencies and transform HR from a primarily administrative function into a strategic leadership role.

The recording of the research webcast presentation, The HR Edge: Winning Strategies for a Disruptive Future, is available for viewing 24/7 on demand.
