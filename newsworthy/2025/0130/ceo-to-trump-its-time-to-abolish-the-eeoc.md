# CEO to Trump: "It’s Time to Abolish the EEOC”

Moscow, Idaho (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Jan 30, 2025 @ 12:30 PM Central — In an open letter to the President, Andrew Crapuchettes, CEO of RedBalloon, called on the Trump administration to abolish the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, citing the damage the overreaching organization has done to American business leadership, employee morale, and entrepreneurship.

"Agencies like the EEOC and DOL are sucking resources and destroying workplace relationships. We urge the Trump administration to end agency overreach and allow America to get back to work."The call for eliminating the EEOC is the first of several suggested actions which would immediately free businesses from needless bureaucracy, such as protecting the gig economy, removing restrictions on salaried roles, offering protection for employers from frivolous lawsuits.

"May the whine of frivolous complaints, fueled by misguided policy, distract our businesses no longer," the letter reads, "Make American Workplaces Great Again!" Read the entire letter here.
