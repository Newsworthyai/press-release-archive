# Caitlin Rourk Announces Campaign for Texas Congressional District 10 Following Landmark Redistricting Shift

Round Rock, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Dec 11, 2025 @ 7:00 PM Central — Caitlin Rourk, a military intelligence officer, mother, and first-time candidate for federal office, has officially launched her campaign to represent Texas Congressional District 10. Her announcement comes after a whirlwind week in Texas politics, as statewide redistricting prompted multiple shifts across the congressional map. For Rourk, the decision to run in CD-10 was both practical and deeply personal: the new boundaries placed her home—and her children’s future—directly inside the district she now seeks to serve.

 Rourk originally entered the race for Texas’ 31st District in July, building a fast-moving grassroots campaign centered on listening to residents and engaging independents and disengaged voters. But when the Supreme Court ruling reshaped the district map, she saw an undeniable opportunity to represent her own community more authentically. “Putting a yard sign in my own yard and asking my neighbors to vote alongside me—that mattered,” she said. “This is home.”

 Her campaign focuses on economic relief for Texas families, protecting and strengthening public schools, supporting military and veteran communities, and restoring trust in government. Voters across the region—spanning Bryan–College Station, Austin, and the rural heart of the district—have expressed rising concerns about housing affordability, insurance premiums, childcare access, and the relentless financial pressures shaping their daily lives.

 Rourk’s service-minded approach mirrors her upbringing in a family of educators and her years in uniform. She believes CD-10’s unique intersection of defense innovation, higher education, and rural communities requires a representative with both lived experience and the stamina to meet constituents where they are.

 She also highlights voter turnout as a critical issue: “People are frustrated and often feel their vote doesn’t matter. But the truth is, primaries and local elections shape the future of our state long before November. Texas needs more engaged, informed voices—and we’re building a campaign to help make that possible.”

 Rourk invites Texans across the political spectrum to learn more, volunteer, or connect directly through her campaign website: www.CaitlinRourk.com.
