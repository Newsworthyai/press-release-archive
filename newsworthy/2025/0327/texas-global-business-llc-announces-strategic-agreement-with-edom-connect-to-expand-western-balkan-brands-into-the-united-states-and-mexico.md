# Texas Global Business, LLC Announces Strategic Agreement with EDOM Connect to Expand Western Balkan Brands into the United States and Mexico

Austin, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Mar 27, 2025 @ 7:00 AM US/Central ‚Äî Texas Global Business, LLC, a premier consulting firm specializing in international business and economic development, is pleased to announce a strategic partnership with EDOM Connect, a global business service platform providing financial and market intelligence, strategic development, supply chain integration and nearshoring solutions across the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland), the Balkans, and Morocco.

This collaboration will accelerate the expansion of leading Western Balkan brands into the U.S. and Mexican markets, strengthening market access and supply chain connectivity. By combining the expertise of both firms, this partnership will introduce high-quality, cost-competitive products and services to key industries in automotive, aerospace, defense, construction, and high-end interior design across North America. This includes high-quality precision components and custom-made metal and composite parts for the automotive and aerospace sectors as well as premium furniture and interior solutions for luxury residential and commercial projects such as hotels, public halls and restaurants.

Western Balkan suppliers within EDOM Connect‚Äôs portfolio are already integral to premium European automotive and transportation manufacturing, supplying leading manufacturers such as Mercedes, Siemens, and SF with precision components. They are also key players for interior furnishings across Europe and North Africa, serving as major suppliers for Ikea and providing high-end furnishings for luxury hotels, state houses, and restaurants throughout Western and Eastern Europe.

Amid evolving U.S. trade policies, this initiative will enhance supply chain resiliency by providing reliable, cost-effective sourcing alternatives from a region that remains underrepresented in North American trade. Moreover, this strategic alliance will facilitate the entry of these proven, high-caliber suppliers into the U.S. and Mexican markets at a pivotal time when advanced manufacturing sectors‚Äîincluding aerospace, defense, automotive, and electronics‚Äîare expanding across Texas, the broader U.S., and Mexico. The timing is particularly significant for Texas, as the state seeks to strengthen and grow its regional advanced manufacturing capacity in aerospace and defense, creating a need for strategic supplier partnerships with reliable, high-quality precision metal and composite material manufacturers.
