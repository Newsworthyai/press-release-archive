Gainesville, Georgia (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Aug 8, 2025 @ 7:00 AM US/Eastern â€” Davies Hothem Injury Law proudly marks its fourth anniversary, reflecting on a steadfast mission to deliver justice for clients and restore hope in the Northeast Georgia community. Founded in 2021 by Kristy Davies and Jennifer Hothem, with Dustin Davies joining as a partner in 2023, the firm has secured over $150 million in verdicts and settlements, including a landmark $10 million motorcycle accident settlement for a client with permanent injuries. Their commitment extends beyond the courtroom, supporting women, children, and veterans through initiatives like the Davies Hothem Domestic Violence Legal Fund.

A Legacy of Advocacy and ResultsWith over 100 trials and a proven track record, Kristy, Jennifer, and Dustin bring unparalleled expertise to personal injury and wrongful death cases. Notable achievements include a $2 million settlement for a traumatic brain injury from a head-on collision, a $1.25 million policy limit settlement, nearly nine times the medical expenses, for a hand injury from a single-vehicle accident, and a $1 million settlement for a child critically injured in an agritourism accident.
