Our previous office at 551 S IH-35, Round Rock, TX 78664 has served us well from the day we opened. It was the place where we first built our team, met our clients, and began making a difference. Now, we’re ready for the next chapter.

This expansion is more than just a new address. It reflects our commitment to providing exceptional in-home care for seniors, veterans, and individuals with disabilities. We meet people where they live and where they feel most comfortable.

“We’ve seen steady growth, especially after being voted [Best of Round Rock in senior services](https://www.bestofroundrocktx.com/category/5172/best-senior-care-service),” said Stacey Eisenberg, Owner of A Place At Home – North Austin”. “This new office gives us room to grow with our community. It’s not just about space. It’s about impact.”The new location includes a dedicated caregiver training room for our home health aides and CNAs, a first for our North Austin branch. This space allows our team to stay sharp, prepared, and compassionate. It helps us better support the unique needs of every client we serve.

Whether we’re helping a veteran get back on their feet or supporting a family managing Alzheimer’s care, our team focuses on one thing. Making aging in place easier, safer, and more comfortable.
