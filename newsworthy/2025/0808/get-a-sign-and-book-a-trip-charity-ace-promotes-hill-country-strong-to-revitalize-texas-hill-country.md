# Get a Sign and Book a Trip: Charity Ace Promotes “Hill Country Strong” to Revitalize Texas Hill Country

Boerne, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Aug 8, 2025 @ 11:00 AM Pacific — Following the July 4, 2025 floods in Texas’ Hill Country, volunteers, first responders, and local businesses have stepped forward to help communities rebuild. Acts of kindness and resilience are shaping the recovery, from neighbors lending a hand to organizations uniting around a common cause.

One standout effort is Signarama’s “Hill Country Strong” campaign, which has produced and donated thousands of yard and storefront signs as symbols of hope and solidarity. Proceeds from sign sales directly benefit small businesses and nonprofits impacted by the floods, providing both financial aid and a visible show of support.

Charity Ace, an impact and fundraising company, has announced its support for the campaign and is encouraging individuals and organizations across the country to get involved.

“The Texas Hill Country Flood devastated so many lives, but it also reminded us that strength is contagious,” said Justin McKenzie, COO of Charity Ace. “Every ‘Hill Country Strong’ sign ordered from your local Signarama is more than decoration—it’s a pledge of support and a reminder that recovery is something we do together.”

Supporters can participate by visiting any Signarama location to order or sponsor a “Hill Country Strong” sign, displaying it in a visible location, and sharing it online with the hashtag #HillCountryStrong to inspire others.
