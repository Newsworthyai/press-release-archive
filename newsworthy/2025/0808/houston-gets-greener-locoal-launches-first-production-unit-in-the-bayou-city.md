# Houston Gets Greener: LOCOAL Launches First Production Unit in the Bayou City

Houston, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Aug 8, 2025 @ 8:00 AM US/Central — Big news for Texas innovation: LOCOALLOCOAL, the pioneering sustainability company you heard about on The Building Texas Show in 2024, has officially launched its first production unit in Houston — turning the city’s wood waste into Biochar, Bioliquids, and clean-burning Biogas.

This milestone builds on the story told by host Justin McKenzie and LOCOAL Co-Founder Miles Murray in their August 2024 episode, “Sparking Innovation: Transforming Waste into Wealth.” In that conversation, Murray detailed LOCOAL’s flagship RAINMAKER™ technology, which converts wood waste into sustainable products that restore soil health, create renewable energy, and generate measurable carbon credits through IMPCT.AI™ tracking.

“Houston is the perfect stage for our next chapter,” says Murray, a West Point graduate and veteran recognized for his leadership in global sustainability initiatives. “This city thrives on big ideas and hard work — and we’re here to turn waste into opportunity, right here in Texas.”

The Houston production unit not only keeps valuable carbon out of the atmosphere but also fuels its own operation with LOCOAL’s AFTERBURN™ technology, which uses biogas to power the process. The result? A self-sustaining, scalable model that benefits agriculture, industry, and the environment.

From helping pecan farmers increase yields with Biochar, to supporting the circular economy with clean energy products, LOCOAL’s impact stretches well beyond waste diversion. And they’re looking for partners — from investors to agricultural cooperatives — to help expand their mission.
