# AKARUI Solutions Deploys MedCognetics’ AI Imaging Platform to Expand Breast Cancer Screening Access in Rural India

Dallas, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Aug 21, 2025 @ 10:30 AM Central — MedCognetics, Inc., a company focusing on medical imaging AI, and AKARUI Solutions LLP (“AKARUI”), a medical imaging equipment and healthcare IT solutions provider, today announced the deployment of MedCognetics’ AI mammography platform under an IRB (Institutional Review Board) agreement in mobile screening vans serving rural communities in India. This collaboration marks a significant milestone in the global push to close healthcare access gaps and demonstrates the power of real-time, AI-embedded diagnostics in resource-constrained environments.

India faces a dramatic shortage of qualified radiologists, with fewer than 500 breast imaging specialists available to serve a population of over 1.35 billion. By embedding MedCognetics' advanced AI software into AKARUI’s diagnostic workflows, this initiative enables mobile mammography units to deliver instant analysis - even in areas where no radiologists are present.

“We created our AI medical imaging technology to positively impact lives in every corner of this earth,” said Debasish “Ron” Nag, CEO of MedCognetics. “This partnership with AKARUI is a real-world testament to that mission, allowing us to bring critical early detection capabilities to regions that have historically lacked access to specialized care.”The deployment leverages MedCognetics’ CogNet AI-MT® software, which is FDA-cleared for triage of mammogram images and developed to reduce bias in cancer detection by incorporating imaging data representative of a wide range of patient populations.

“AKARUI’s software is designed to optimize medical imaging processes, ensuring high-quality care and efficient operation. Our goal has always been to build technologies that empower healthcare providers to serve communities more efficiently,” said Suhas Pokale, CEO of AKARUI Solutions LLP. “Integrating MedCognetics’ AI platform into our systems allows us to deliver enterprise-grade diagnostic power in even the most remote parts of India.”This collaboration also aligns with MedCognetics’ broader strategy to globalize equitable access to diagnostic imaging, using AI as a force multiplier in regions with limited radiology resources. The technology is specifically engineered for real-time use in portable deployments, such as mammography vans, without compromising performance or accuracy.

Key Benefits of the AKARUI / MedCognetics Integration:

* AI at the Edge: On-device cancer detection eliminates the need for cloud connectivity.
* Faster Results: Triaging and imaging streamline patient throughput.
* Workforce Extension: Bridges the diagnostic gap in regions with few breast imaging specialists.
* Scalable Infrastructure: Portable, upgradable platform designed for cost-effective deployments.

This deployment supports AKARUI’s upcoming regional product launch with global imaging OEMs and reinforces MedCognetics’ position as a pioneer in unbiased AI for healthcare.
