# Mitch Gould and Nutritional Products International Spotlight Proven Model for Rapid U.S. Retail Expansion and Brand Growth

Boca Raton, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Aug 21, 2025 @ 9:00 AM US/Eastern — Action star Steven Seagal may be best known for his blockbuster films, but behind the scenes he turned to Mitch Gould, founder and CEO of Nutritional Products International (NPI), to bring his vision for a consumer product brand to life. Together, they launched Steven Seagal’s Lightning Bolt Energy Drink from concept to store shelves in under a year—an achievement that continues to define NPI’s reputation as one of the fastest and most effective brand launch firms in the United States. Within months, Lightning Bolt was on Amazon, in Walmart supercenters and 7-Eleven stores nationwide, ultimately generating millions in sales.

Lightning Bolt is just one of many success stories. Gould and his team have helped a diverse range of brands achieve rapid sales growth and national distribution:

* Flora Herbal Supplements – NPI placed more than 100 SKUs of Flora’s supplements on Amazon, positioning the century-old brand for another hundred years of growth
* Native Remedies – By applying its “evolution of distribution” strategy, NPI helped this South African herbal remedies brand achieve millions in new U.S. sales in record time
* SlimFX – Partnering with industry veteran Tim Richerson, Gould brought SlimFX, an all-natural diet pill, from concept to thousands of retail stores nationwide. The brand was stocked by GNC, CVS, and health food outlets across the country, with sales in the millions.

* Scitec Nutrition – guided the European sports nutrition powerhouse into the U.S. market, securing premium placement in The Vitamin Shoppe through NPI’s system.

Additional High-Profile Collaborations, underscoring NPI’s ability to convert attention into retail traction and sustained sales growth.

* Chuck Liddell’s Iceman RX – backed by unique promotional campaigns.
* Hulk Hogan’s Hogan Energy – introducing a supplement in novel delivery formats.
* Bob Wall’s KO Fitness Water – mineral-enhanced hydration drink launched with NPI into Amazon and national retailers.

A Blueprint for Growth“These case studies remain my favorites because they perfectly illustrate NPI’s formula for success,” said Mitch Gould, CEO of Nutritional Products International. “From day one, our mission has been to deliver speed-to-market, retail penetration, and profitability. What we achieved with Lightning Bolt, Flora, Native Remedies, and SlimFX is exactly what we continue to achieve today for major brands across categories.”Watch the NPI case study video.
