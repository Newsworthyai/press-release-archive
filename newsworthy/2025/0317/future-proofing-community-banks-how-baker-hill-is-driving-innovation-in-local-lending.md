# Future-Proofing Community Banks: How Baker Hill is Driving Innovation in Local Lending

Boerne, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Mar 17, 2025 @ 11:15 AM US/Central — As digital-first banks and fintech disruptors reshape financial services, community banks face a crucial turning point—adapt or risk being left behind. In a recent episode of Building Texas (watch here), Bryan Peckinpaugh, SVP, National Sales Manager at Baker Hill, discusses the urgent need for community banks to embrace technology while preserving their core mission: serving local businesses and economies.

 “Banking isn’t just about deposits and loans—it’s the foundation of our communities,” said Peckinpaugh. “The money that community banks lend powers small businesses, funds local infrastructure, and supports the dreams of entrepreneurs. Without them, our towns and cities would look vastly different.” The Critical Role of Community Banks in AmericaCommunity banks and credit unions fuel economic growth, yet many struggle to compete with the speed and efficiency of digital banking. Peckinpaugh highlights how traditional institutions are hindered by legacy systems that prevent them from delivering the seamless experience customers expect.

“In today’s market, a consumer can order nearly anything online in minutes, yet getting a business loan from a traditional bank often takes months,” he explained. “That’s not a sustainable model. If community banks don’t modernize, they will lose their relevance—and that’s a loss no town or small business can afford.”

“We believe the future of banking isn’t just digital—it’s digital with purpose,” said Peckinpaugh. “Our mission is to free up bankers to do what they do best: serve as trusted advisors and advocates for their customers.”With its platform facilitating over $1 billion in monthly lending activity across 400 financial institutions, Baker Hill is proving that technology and tradition can work together to create stronger financial institutions. The company is also launching innovation campuses across the U.S., with its latest venture in Santa Barbara, CA, and an upcoming expansion in Texas.

The event will feature renowned thought leaders, including Malcolm Gladwell, alongside industry experts discussing the future of financial services.

“This isn’t just a conference—it’s a movement,” said Peckinpaugh. “We’re calling on community banks to take control of their future, embrace innovation, and reclaim their leadership in local economies.”Take Action: The Future of Community Banking Starts NowCommunity banks must evolve to remain the backbone of local economies.
