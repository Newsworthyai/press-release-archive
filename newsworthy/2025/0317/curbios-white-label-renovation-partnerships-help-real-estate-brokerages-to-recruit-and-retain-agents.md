# Curbio’s White Label Renovation Partnerships Help Real Estate Brokerages to Recruit and Retain Agents

Potomac, MD (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Mar 17, 2025 @ 4:45 PM Eastern — Curbio, the leading national residential listing renovation specialist, has launched a white label concierge partnership program for real estate franchisers and brokerages of all sizes. A Powered by Curbio® partnership enables brokerages to earn significant marketing fees by integrating an on-demand concierge market-readiness solution into their suite of value-added services.

“To recruit and retain successful agents, brokerages need to support them with a suite of concierge services that help them win listings. Mortgage, title, warranty, and inspection are no longer enough,” said Matthew Siegal, Curbio’s co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer. “Agents expect brokers to provide an on-demand renovation solution that they can rely on to prep every listing without having to schedule contractors, source materials, and manage projects.”Under the Powered by Curbio® partnership program, agents offer Curbio’s concierge renovation services to their sellers and buyers under their brokerage’s white label brand. Their local Curbio project manager oversees every aspect of the projects, from scheduling contractors, to sourcing materials, to on-site inspections, to ensuring on-time completion.

“Successful agents don’t have time to manage renovation projects, and with Curbio they don’t have to,” added Siegal. “Agents regard their local Curbio project manager as a member of their team, someone who knows what they expect and is on call to prep every listing.”Curbio provides a full range of interior and exterior services, from minor repairs, staging, and refreshes to kitchens, baths, and complete makeovers. However, Curbio has built its reputation on providing unique features and services that typical contractors don’t offer. For example, to avoid delays, the company maintains a curated catalog of readily available materials, fixtures, and appliances in various grades from builder to luxury. It also uses proprietary project management software that optimizes contractor scheduling and minimizes non-productive days.

Curbio created the concierge renovation concept in 2017 to help agents get their listings ready for market without having to manage projects. The company preps buy and sell side properties in dozens of U.S. markets and has served thousands of agents from nearly every major brokerage, including eXp, RE/MAX, Weichert, HomesServices, Redfin, Keller Williams, Coldwell Banker, and Century 21.
