# Comedy Village Releases Black Friday 2025 Deals With $20 NYC Laugh Pack and $44 Unlimited Laughs Pass VIP

New York, NY (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Nov 28, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Eastern — Comedy Village in Times Square is launching two powerful Black Friday 2025 deals that give locals and visitors a rare chance to enjoy top-tier comedy at a fraction of the normal cost. These offers run from Black Friday through Cyber Monday. Once the window closes, buyers will wait until next year to see savings this strong again.

 The first offer is the NYC Laugh Pack. It includes two tickets and one drink each. The regular price is $80. The Black Friday price is $20. The pack is valid for any show through the end of 2026, which lets buyers secure a full year of plans in one simple purchase. Because it is digital, buyers can send it instantly as a holiday gift.

 The second offer is the Unlimited Laughs Pass VIP. It covers two people for one full year. The regular price is $150. The Black Friday price is $44. Holders pay nothing at the door. They can walk in any night and enjoy unlimited shows. A two item minimum still applies. Couples and friends use it as an easy way to see new talent without thinking about ticket fees.

 Comedy Village is the only full time comedy club in New York that is owned and run by a working comic. PJ Landers has been on stage for more than twenty years. He grew up in Woodside and Sunnyside in Queens and began performing in the early nineties. He trained at HB Studios, acted in House of Cards and Spike Lee’s She’s Gotta Have It, and produced several indie projects shaped by sharp humor and New York culture. His time running the historic Boston Comedy Club and the original Comedy Village guides every decision he makes in the room today.

 The club reopened in 2024 at 352 West 44th Street. It now runs shows seven nights a week and has earned more than 2,100 reviews. It ranks in the top three comedy clubs in New York City on Google and continues to grow through consistent live shows and strong crowd response.

 “Comedy has carried me through every part of my life. These offers are my way of opening the door for more people to experience it,” PJ said.

 Comedy Village is also taking bookings for corporate and private holiday events. Groups can secure catered parties that include food, drinks, and a live show. Availability is limited during December.
