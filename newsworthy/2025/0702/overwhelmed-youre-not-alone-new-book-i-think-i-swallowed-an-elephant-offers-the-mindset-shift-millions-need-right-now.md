# Overwhelmed? You’re Not Alone. New Book I Think I Swallowed An Elephant Offers the Mindset Shift Millions Need Right Now

Austin, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Jul 2, 2025 @ 5:00 AM Pacific — In a world moving faster than our hearts and heads can keep up with, Bryan and Jeffrey Eisenberg, New York Times bestselling authors of Call to Action and Waiting For Your Cat to Bark, have released a new kind of business book. I Think I Swallowed An Elephant isn’t just about getting more done. It’s about how to stop carrying things that don’t belong to you in the first place.

This book lands at a time when burnout isn’t a buzzword. It’s a baseline.

People feel buried under expectations, distractions, and to-do lists that never end. But Bryan and Jeffrey aren’t offering another hustle strategy. They’re holding out a mirror and handing you a map.

“I wrote this book because I needed it,” says Bryan. “We all swallow invisible elephants. Beliefs, responsibilities, even goals that aren’t ours. It weighs us down until we forget who we are.”I Think I Swallowed An Elephant leads readers through a personal transformation arc. It starts with overwhelm, moves through clarity, and ends with belief and purpose in action. Yes, there are insights for marketers and entrepreneurs. But it also speaks to anyone who’s asked, How did my life get so far off track?

The Eisenbergs teach readers how to:

* Let go of limiting beliefs and outdated stories
* Redefine success around values, not volume
* Break big problems into digestible, winnable pieces
* Build forward momentum through small, deliberate actions

The book draws from decades of work in behavioral science, marketing, and leadership. But its voice is personal, direct, and human. Each chapter invites readers to pause, reflect, and realign.

“Every once in a while, a book comes along that doesn’t just inform. It reshapes how you think, act, and live,” said Melissa Burdon Cameron, CMO of NSA Storage. “I recommend it to anyone in a season of self-reflection or growth—whether you’re navigating a career shift, seeking clarity in your personal goals, or looking to elevate your business strategy.”Already praised for its depth, warmth, and practicality, I Think I Swallowed An Elephant is available in Kindle, paperback, and audiobook formats.
