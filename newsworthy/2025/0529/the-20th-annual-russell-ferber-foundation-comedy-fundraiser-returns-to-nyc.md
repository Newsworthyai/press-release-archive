# The 20th Annual Russell Ferber Foundation Comedy FUNdraiser Returns to NYC

Village Community School 272 West 10th Street, NYC (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday May 29, 2025 @ 1:00 PM Pacific — One of New York City’s most cherished comedy benefit events celebrates two decades of heart and humor this summer. On Wednesday, June 25th, the 20th Annual Russell Ferber Foundation Comedy FUN!draiser returns for an unforgettable evening of laughter, community, and giving back.Hosted by stand-up comedian and podcaster Jordon Ferber, this special night brings together top comedic talent, delicious bites, wine and beer, and a host of incredible raffle and silent auction prizes — all in support of empowering aspiring culinary students and honoring the memory of Russell Ferber.

This year’s all-star comedy lineup includes:

* Jordan Carlos (The Nightly Show, First Wives Club)
* Greg Wilson (Comedy Central, The Neighborhood)
* Janeane Garofalo (SNL, Wet Hot American Summer, Reality Bites)

The Foundation’s Story Russell Ferber was just 21 years old when his life was tragically cut short in a car accident on July 6, 2002 — just days after completing his Baking and Pastry Arts degree at The Culinary Institute of America (CIA). To honor his memory and keep his passion alive, the Ferber family founded The Russell Ferber Foundation in 2003. Its mission: to help young people pursue dreams that mirror Russell’s own—through culinary education, scholarship, and support for those with learning differences.

Where Your Support Goes The Foundation proudly partners with C-CAP (Careers through Culinary Arts Program), offering inner-city high school students access to culinary training and mentorship. It also funds a fully endowed scholarship at CIA, and contributes to the VCS Russell Ferber Memorial Fund, which provides educational and psychological services to students with learning differences at Village Community School.

Come Celebrate and Support a Great Cause This year’s event is generously sponsored by Grandaisy Bakery and Jeremy’s Ale House. Guests will also meet some of the Foundation’s talented pastry scholars—and even sample a few of their creations.
