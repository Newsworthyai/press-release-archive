# Flower Bar Design Studio Selected to Present with Monet’s Water Lilies at Legion of Honor

Santa Cruz, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday May 29, 2025 @ 9:00 AM Pacific — Flower Bar Design Studio, Santa Cruz's premier florist renowned for its innovative floral artistry, has been honored with an invitation to showcase their floral design alongside Claude Monet’s iconic masterpiece, "Water Lilies," at San Francisco's prestigious Legion of Honor museum.

Sharon Schneider, founder and owner of Flower Bar Design Studio, brings nearly three decades of dedication, artistry, and expertise to this momentous event.

“It's an honor to translate my own creative vision inspired by Monet's deep appreciation for the natural world," Schneider shared. "His ability to draw inspiration from nature resonates deeply with my own passion to use natural elements for my floral design and the endless creativity it offers.”Having recently transitioned from her café and retail floral shop (Flower Bar) to focusing more on custom floral design at her new studio location, Flower Bar Design Studio now specializes in creating bespoke floral arrangements for weddings, funerals, corporate events, and other special occasions.

The new studio website, flowerbardesignstudio.com, crafted by Demian, highlights their custom floral services with an elegant showcase complementing their exquisite designs. Customers can continue shopping online for Sharon's floral arrangements and gifts at shopflowerbar.com.

The presentation will be part of the deYoung museum’s 100th-anniversary Bouquets to Art celebrations, an annual exhibition featuring botanical interpretations by leading Bay Area floral designers inspired by deYoung and Legion of Honor artwork and architecture. Flower Bar Design Studio’s arrangement will be on display from June 3rd through June 8th.

Flower Bar Design Studio invites art and flower enthusiasts alike to experience this unique collaboration, celebrating beauty and artistry that transcends mediums.
