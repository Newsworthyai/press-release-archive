# Colorado Judicial Institute Addresses the Influence of AI on the Legal Community

Denver, CO (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Oct 28, 2025 @ 10:50 AM US/Mountain — Colorado Judicial Institute (CJI), the state’s only independent, nonpartisan nonprofit dedicated to promoting excellence, equity, impartiality, and public trust in Colorado’s courts, announced it will host a Thought Leadership Forum on one of the most pressing issues facing the legal profession: the influence of artificial intelligence.

 The forum, “AI Today: What the Legal Community Needs to Know Right Now,” will take place November 6 and bring together judges and legal experts to explore how AI is reshaping the practice of law — from courtroom ethics to law firm innovation.

 “AI is no longer a future trend. It’s here now, and it’s already testing the boundaries of ethics, professionalism, and trust in our courts,” said CJI Board Chair Thor Nelson. “This forum will provide Colorado’s legal community with the insights needed to navigate the risks and seize the opportunities that AI presents.”
