LAS VEGAS, NV (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Apr 30, 2025 @ 4:00 AM Pacific — Survale, the leading provider of candidate experience management solutions, today announced its acquisition of the CandE Candidate Experience Research and Awards Program from ERE Media. The deal, finalized earlier this month and announced today at the ERE Recruiting Innovation Summit, sees Survale acquire all assets of the renowned CandE program. As part of the acquisition, Kevin Grossman, VP of Research at ERE, will join Survale as Vice President of CandE Benchmark Research. Survale and Grossman will jointly service all current CandE Research and Awards Program participants for 2025 and will continue the program beyond. Survale has served as the technology platform powering the CandE program since 2017.

"We are thrilled to officially welcome the CandE program into the Survale family," said Jason Moreau, CEO of Survale. "Having been the technology backbone for the CandEs for nearly a decade, this acquisition is a natural evolution. The integration of this prestigious program will significantly enhance our already robust candidate experience benchmark data, provide us with access to a valuable network of talent acquisition leaders, and add unparalleled industry expertise to our team and for the benefit of our clients."For participants in the CandE program, the acquisition by Survale promises a more streamlined and integrated experience. "This transition to Survale, the long-standing technology partner of the CandE program, will create a more seamless research process and the ability to better scale by unlocking exciting new features and benefits for participants in the future," stated Kevin Grossman, the newly appointed Vice President of CandE Benchmark Research at Survale. "I am eager to join the Survale team and continue to drive the CandE program forward, providing even greater value and insights to organizations committed to exceptional candidate experiences."

The acquisition strategically benefits Survale by expanding its already extensive database of candidate experience benchmark data, gaining access to the CandE program's large and established client base, and incorporating deep domain expertise into the company and for its existing clients. CandE program participants will benefit from a more tightly integrated research platform, simplifying the process and paving the way for the introduction of advanced features and enhanced program offerings.

The Impact of Candidate Experience on Recruiting Outcomes

Research from the CandE Program underscores the importance of candidate experience: organizations with high candidate satisfaction scores see up to 60% of candidates willing to apply again, 55% more likely to refer others, and 40% more likely to become brand advocates. Conversely, poor experiences lead to 66% of candidates sharing negative feedback with their networks and 34% posting publicly on platforms like Glassdoor, impacting employer brand and revenue. Survale’s real-time feedback platform, now fully integrated with CandE, enables organizations to address these challenges proactively, improving hiring outcomes and employer reputation
