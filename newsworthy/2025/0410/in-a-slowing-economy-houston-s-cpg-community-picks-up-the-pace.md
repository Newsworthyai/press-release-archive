# In a Slowing Economy, Houston's CPG Community Picks Up the Pace

Houston, TX USA (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Apr 10, 2025 @ 2:40 PM Pacific — As unemployment rates climb and headlines grow shakier, a different story is taking shape in Houston. On Wednesday, April 23, a wave of emerging consumer brands will take over Lustre Pearl East Downtown for the first-ever CPG Houston Market Happy Hour. Business, creativity, and real connection will take center stage.

With food, wellness, and lifestyle brands expected, the event offers a rare chance to meet the makers behind some of Houston's most dynamic consumer products — from emerging names to those already landing on store shelves. It's a key opportunity for retail buyers, category managers, distributors, investors, and advisors to tap into Houston's growing CPG scene.

The event is free to attend and open to the public, but space is limited. RSVP at lu.ma/yqwqcn0p.

FOR BRANDS:

The CPG Houston Market Happy Hour isn't about big stages or polished pitch decks — it's about showing up and being part of positive growth. Share your product with new faces, build local awareness, or connect with others building in the same space.

Showcasing to this community is a great way to plug in, gather feedback, capture content, make new friends (and customers), and meet the folks who care to make a difference.

Even when news headlines are rough, this community shows up, builds, and bets on the future.
