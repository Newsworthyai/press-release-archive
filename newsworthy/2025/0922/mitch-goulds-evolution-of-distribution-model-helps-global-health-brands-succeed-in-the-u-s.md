# Mitch Gould’s “Evolution of Distribution” Model Helps Global Health Brands Succeed in the U.S.

Boca Raton, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Sep 22, 2025 @ 7:00 AM US/Eastern — Breaking into the U.S. retail market can be overwhelming for international brands. Nutritional Products International (NPI), founded by veteran retail expert Mitch Gould, has become the go-to partner for health and wellness companies looking for a cost-effective, streamlined way to reach American consumers.

“Companies often underestimate how different the U.S. market really is,” said Gould, CEO of NPI. “You’re not only dealing with a unique retail culture but also navigating regulatory agencies like the FDA. That’s why we created a system that brings every piece of the puzzle under one roof.”The Evolution of Distribution™To solve these challenges, Gould pioneered the Evolution of Distribution™, a one-stop solution that integrates sales, marketing, logistics, and regulatory expertise. Instead of managing multiple partners, brands can rely on NPI to handle the entire U.S. launch process from importation to retail placement.

* Regulatory Expertise: NPI employs a food scientist with extensive FDA experience to ensure compliance.
* Logistics Support: The company’s logistics professionals coordinate overseas shipping and customs clearance before products arrive at NPI’s Florida warehouse.
* Sales & Retail Access: Once in the U.S., NPI’s sales team promotes and places products with major retailers, e-commerce platforms, and distribution partners nationwide.

Decades of Retail RelationshipsThroughout his career, Gould has visited, and procured orders, at the headquarters of Costco, Sam’s Club, Home Depot, Lowe’s, CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid, Kmart, Target, Walmart, and 7-Eleven, among others. These longstanding relationships have helped him place hundreds of products into some of the most recognized retailers in the country.

“Being inside those corporate offices gave me a front-row seat to how America’s biggest retailers operate,” Gould said. “That knowledge is what allows us to guide international companies through the complexities of U.S. distribution.”Marketing That Moves the NeedleRecognizing that new brands can’t always afford traditional Madison Avenue agencies, Gould also launched InHealth Media (IHM), NPI’s in-house marketing arm. IHM specializes in high-impact campaigns across digital, social, influencer, and retail-focused media, giving health and wellness companies the visibility they need without the excessive costs.

A Proven Formula for GrowthOver his career, Gould has visited nearly every major retail headquarters in the United States and has helped place hundreds of products on store shelves and online platforms. His “Evolution of Distribution™” model has proven to be a winning formula by combining cost-efficiency with speed-to-market.

“International brands don’t just need a distributor—they need a partner that understands how to succeed in America,” Gould said. “That’s exactly what NPI delivers.”
