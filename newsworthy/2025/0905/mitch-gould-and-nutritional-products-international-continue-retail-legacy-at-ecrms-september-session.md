# Mitch Gould and Nutritional Products International Continue Retail Legacy at ECRM’s September Session

Boca Raton, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Sep 5, 2025 @ 10:19 AM US/Eastern — Nutritional Products International (NPI), a leading global brand management and retail distribution firm, announced today that its executive team will attend the ECRM Vitamin, Weight Management & Sports Nutrition Session beginning Monday, September 8th, at the PGA National Resort & Spa in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.

ECRM (Efficient Collaborative Retail Marketing) events connect product manufacturers with retail buyers through private, one-on-one meetings designed to spark lasting business relationships. For NPI, these sessions represent a streamlined alternative to the decades its founder and CEO, Mitch Gould, spent traveling across the United States to personally meet buyers at corporate headquarters.

“Before ECRM, I personally traveled to virtually every major retail headquarters in the country — Costco, Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, Rite Aid, Kmart, Sam’s Club, 7-Eleven — and secured millions of dollars in orders,” said Gould. “Some of these headquarters are like small cities, and walking their halls was an education in how retail really works.”A Career Spanning Every Retail ChannelFor more than 35 years, Gould has been at the forefront of U.S. retail distribution, working with consumer goods across health, wellness, sports nutrition, and general merchandise. His track record includes placing products in major retailers such as Walmart, Costco, CVS, GNC, Rite Aid, The Home Depot, and Lowe’s.

In the early 2000s, Gould also played a pivotal role in helping Amazon.com establish its sports nutrition category. By placing more than 100 brands onto Amazon’s then-new health and wellness platform, he helped lay the foundation for what would become one of the largest online marketplaces for supplements and fitness products.

Gould’s career has also intersected with major celebrities and athletes. He has collaborated with Steven Seagal, Hulk Hogan, Chuck Liddell, Ronnie Coleman, Steve Garvey, Joe Theismann, Wayne Gretzky, and Roberto Clemente Jr., leveraging their reach to accelerate product launches such as Seagal’s Lightning Bolt Energy Drink, which landed on Walmart and 7-Eleven shelves nationwide within a year.
