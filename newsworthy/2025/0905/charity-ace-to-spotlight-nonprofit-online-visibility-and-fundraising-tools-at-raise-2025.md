# Charity Ace to Spotlight Nonprofit Online Visibility and Fundraising Tools at Raise 2025

San Antonio, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Sep 5, 2025 @ 4:15 PM Central — Charity Ace is proud to announce its sponsorship of Raise 2025, the premier fundraising conference hosted by OneCause, bringing together nonprofit leaders, fundraisers, and innovators to explore the future of philanthropy. Raise 2025 will take place September 8-9, 2025 in San Antonio, Texas, with Charity Ace executives and team members in attendance.

At this year’s conference, Charity Ace will debut Charity Ace News, a groundbreaking news marketing service designed to help charities and nonprofits gain visibility in search engines, online news streams, and even AI-powered chat results. The service provides nonprofits with an affordable, high-impact way to amplify their mission and reach wider audiences.

In addition, Charity Ace continues to curate a portfolio of risk-free consignment travel packages, giving nonprofits exciting new tools to raise funds through auctions without financial risk.

Justin McKenzie, COO of Charity Ace, will be on hand to connect with attendees and share the company’s vision for expanding nonprofit fundraising opportunities.

A highlight of the conference will be a special one-on-one session with David McInnis, online news marketing expert and founder of PRWeb and Newsworthy.ai. McInnis will personally guide nonprofits in issuing their very first press release through Charity Ace News—free of charge. Each press release distributed during the event carries an estimated value of over $250 and represents a meaningful opportunity for charities to gain immediate media exposure.

Charity Ace will also contribute to the community by making a donation to Texas Hill Country Flood Relief for every press release distributed during Raise 2025.
