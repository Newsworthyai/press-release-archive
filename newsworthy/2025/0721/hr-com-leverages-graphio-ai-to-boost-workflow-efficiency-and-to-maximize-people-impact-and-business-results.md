# HR.com Leverages Graphio.ai to Boost Workflow Efficiency and to Maximize People Impact and Business Results

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Jul 21, 2025 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — HR.com, the world’s largest global community of HR professionals, is leading the way in transforming workforce intelligence by partnering with Graphio.ai—an AI-powered analytics platform designed to revolutionize how organizations understand and optimize workforce processes and talent flow.

Through this innovation, HR.com is not only transforming its own approach—it’s also providing the broader HR community with a model for how modern technology and AI-driven insights can empower faster, smarter decision-making and drive organizational success.

Using Graphio.ai’s technology, HR.com is pioneering real-time "corporate health checks" that uncover hidden blockers, inefficiencies, and productivity gaps that traditional tools often overlook. This automation continuously collects and analyzes large-scale data across departments to assess current processes, efficiencies, and policies for different roles and teams within an organization. Rather than simply tracking output, the platform assesses whether employees are taking the right actions aligned with desired outcomes—without singling out individual performance.

“HR.com isn’t just talking about the future of HR—they’re living it,” said Dmitry Norenko, CEO of Graphio.ai. “By using Graphio internally, they’re setting a standard: aligning their own teams around automatically generated procedures and continuously tracking execution against those expectations. It’s a shift from managing people by gut feel to managing operations by fact - and we’re proud to be the system making that shift possible”Key Features Include:* Aggregated Team Insights: Assess performance and identify bottlenecks by team or role—balancing privacy with productivity.
* Continuous Monitoring: Receive ongoing insights into what’s working and what needs improvement, with actionable plans to guide change.
* Cross-Departmental Analysis: Combine data from multiple systems to reveal breakdowns in cross-functional workflows.
* Guided Next Steps: Smart, AI-driven recommendations help managers and employees stay aligned and improve results.

“Evaluating individual and team performance has always been subjective—until NOW. For the first time, leaders can access all key data points that measure productivity and performance. Leadership has long needed a smarter, scalable solution,” stated Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator and CEO of HR.com. “With this technology, we’re making operational excellence and employee alignment measurable and manageable for organizations of any size.”

About Graphio.aiGraphio.ai is an early warning system that auto-generates SOPs from API-enabled metadata, compares them to real team execution, and flags deviations.Built on best practices and actual team execution, these SOPs can be customized by leadership. When teams go off track, Graphio sends targeted nudges to get them back in flow. We detect silent execution risks - like rep disengagement, broken handoffs, flight risk, and misaligned tasks - before they stall deals, delay projects, or cause client churn.Contact: Dmitry Norenko, Graphio.ai. dn@graphio.ai
