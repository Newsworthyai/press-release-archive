# Debut Album for The Soda Crackers, Spotify to LP

Bakersfield, California (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Dec 5, 2025 @ 8:00 AM US/Central — Once again original Bakersfield Sound country music is back on vinyl! In the spirit of the long-gone legendary local record label Tally Records, the label that first put the Hag’s one-of-a-kind voice to wax, the tradition of original music on vinyl right here in Bakersfield lives on!The Soda Crackers are happy to announce their self-titled debut album “The Soda Crackers” is now streaming on all platforms & available on vinyl record featuring all new original music from your Sun-Fun-Stay-Playboys! “It’s been about a full year long process but we’re excited to release our first album” said Zane Adamo, 32, who serves as The Soda Crackers’ rhythm guitarist, lead vocalist, and fiddler.

 “This project was a ‘Bakersfield’ inspired endeavor, start to finish. This album was inspired by all the legendary Bakersfield Sound artists that came before us.”

 Back in mid December 2024, the six-piece band set out to start recording their new original music written by band members. Much of the recording took place at Ecco-Fonic Studio in Northridge, CA under the direction of SoCal traditional Country & Western guru Deke Dickerson. Auxiliary recording sessions also took place in Oklahoma City, OK at Angel Cowboy Studio & by Alex Clark in Norman, OK. Recording finished up this past July 2025.

 “We didn’t want to rush this first album. Really wanted to solidify our identity and sound as a band before we started putting out music”, says Adamo. “I know it’s something we’ve always wanted to do as a band but all the starsaligned these past 11 months or so to put out our first album.”

 The Crackers’ lead guitarist Ben McCarthy wrote two of the new originals on the album, “Don’t Start A Fire” & "Blackboard Boogie” and Adamo wrote two new originals “Goin’ Broke, Livin’ Rich” and “Tomorrow’s Used To Be” while also re-recording the band’s debut single’s A-side “Two-Step Solution.” The album features ten songs, six originals by current and former Soda Crackers and four covers by some of the Crackers’ biggest influences. Mixing & mastering was done between both Dickerson of Ecco-Fonic Studio & Kyle Appleton of Appleton Productions.

 All tracks are streaming now on all platforms but for those who still celebrate & value the classic drop of the needle on vinyl, The Soda Crackers, your Sun-Fun-Stay-Playboys, debut album is now available online, at Going Underground Records in downtown Bakersfield & Little Tokyo, and at all SodaCrackers shows.
