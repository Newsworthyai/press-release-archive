Ross Dunn, host of "SEO 101," shared his thoughts on this achievement: "Hosting the SEO 101 Podcast since 2009 has been and continues to be an absolute pleasure. I cemented my friendship with the late John Carcutt over a decade of shows, and I now enjoy hanging with my buddy, Scott Van Achte. On top of that, I've been fortunate to work with Jorge Hermida and the WMR.FM production team! All in all, this show has changed my life for the better."Dunn added, "The SEO 101 Podcast is one of the reasons I still enjoy what I do. Working with a golden production team, great co-hosts, amazing guests, and fielding questions from listeners from all over the world has simply blown my mind. I still can't believe a recorded conversation between two nerdy SEOs is listened to... never mind becoming as incredibly successful as it has!"
