# Gilley International Group Showcases South Side Development Strategy on The Building Texas Show

San Antonio, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Dec 9, 2025 @ 7:00 AM US/Central — The Building Texas Show, hosted by Texas business leader Justin McKenzie, features a powerful new episode with developer Gilley Mendoza, founder of Gilley International Group, whose ambitious, community-driven real estate projects are reshaping the future of South San Antonio.

 Mendoza, a first-generation developer with deep roots on the South Side, shares how his journey from college student to land developer began with an early fascination for real estate and a desire to build long-term generational opportunity. “I’ve always envisioned building a brand that could go international,” Mendoza said. “But it starts here, with my own community.”

 Building the Future Where It’s Needed Most Gilley International Group has identified the South Side—specifically the corridor between Loop 410 and Loop 1604—as one of Texas’ most promising growth regions. While North San Antonio has long been fully developed, the southern arc remains almost entirely greenfield. “For the next 20 years, there is room for growth for everybody,” Mendoza noted.

 The region’s momentum is fueled by major institutional anchors, including:

 * Palo Alto College, directly across from Mendoza’s flagship development
* Texas A&M University–San Antonio, now one of Texas’ fastest-growing universities with a 700-acre master plan
* Expanding advanced manufacturing from Toyota, JCB, and other major employers

 These factors position the South Side as one of Texas’ next major workforce, education, and housing clusters.

 Spotlight Project: Villaret Commons During the episode, Mendoza unveiled new details about Villaret Commons, an 80-unit mixed residential community designed to meet the needs of first-generation homeowners, students, and the region’s expanding workforce.

 Located directly across from Palo Alto College, the project will feature:

 * 19 duplexes (38 doors)
* 42 single-family homes
* Thoughtful “horizontal” development including roads, utilities, and modern infrastructure

 With horizontal construction scheduled for completion in the next 45 days, Villaret Commons is positioned to become one of the most accessible and strategically located new communities in South San Antonio.

 Approachable Housing for a Growing Workforce Unlike large institutional builders moving into sensitive neighborhoods, Gilley International emphasizes “approachable housing”—homes priced to match the salaries of South Side manufacturing and trade jobs without compromising quality.

 “I didn’t say it was ‘affordable’ housing,” Mendoza explained. “But we are intentionally building homes in the $250,000 to $300,000 range because that’s where the community’s workforce is. That’s the opportunity.”

 A Development Philosophy Rooted in Community Mendoza openly discussed both the challenges and opportunities of building in the neighborhoods where he grew up. While some residents express skepticism toward developers, he believes transparency and engagement are essential.

 “You can’t make everyone happy,” he said. “But most people on the South Side want better retail, better housing, better options. I grew up here. I’m willing to do the work, have the conversations, and build what this community deserves.”

 Host Justin McKenzie praised Mendoza’s commitment:

 “This is the best kind of development we can hope for—local investors reinvesting in their own community with intention, long-term thinking, and respect for San Antonio’s heritage.”
