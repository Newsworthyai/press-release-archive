# TNT Highlights CLEAR WHEY as a Light, Refreshing Protein Option for Athletes and Everyday Wellness

Boca Raton, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Dec 9, 2025 @ 2:00 PM Pacific — True Nutrition Technology (TNT) announced today a renewed emphasis on the growing popularity of its CLEAR WHEY Protein, a refreshing whey isolate formula long favored by European athletes seeking a lighter, easier-to-digest protein source. As TNT prepares for expanded U.S. availability, the company is educating consumers on why CLEAR WHEY has become a staple in Germany’s performance nutrition community.

 “CLEAR WHEY stands out because it delivers elite whey isolate performance without the heaviness of typical protein shakes,” said Markus Himmelstoss, Managing Director of True Nutrition Technology. “It’s crisp, refreshing, highly digestible, and made in Germany to the strictest quality standards.”

 A Refreshing Alternative to Milky Protein Shakes TNT CLEAR WHEY mixes into a beverage more similar to an iced tea or soft drink, offering athletes a clean, light experience — ideal during workouts or any time of day.

 Key Benefits of TNT CLEAR WHEY

 * 81% whey protein isolate
* Extremely low carbs and fat
* Not milky — light, refreshing, soda-like taste
* Very high in BCAAs and amino acids
* Soy-free, lactose-free, and easy to digest
* Superior solubility with minimal foam
* Perfect intra-workout protein source
* Suitable for vegetarians (microbial rennet)

 Clear Whey provides a unique advantage: it delivers full-strength whey isolate nutrition without the thickness that causes many athletes to avoid protein shakes — especially during training.

 German-Made Quality With Rigorous Testing TNT CLEAR WHEY is manufactured in Germany under IFS-certified conditions, using whey sourced from the EU. To ensure continuous purity and safety, TNT conducts routine external laboratory microbiological and hygienic testing.

 “Consumers trust TNT because of our uncompromising German manufacturing standards,” Himmelstoss added. “Every batch of CLEAR WHEY meets the quality expectations athletes rely on.”

 Why TNT’s Clear Whey Tastes Better To address the common problem of dry or thin-tasting Clear Whey formulas, TNT uses a specialized blend of isolates that improves taste, reduces foaming, and creates a smoother mouthfeel.

 “Our Clear Whey is built on a specialized formula that blends multiple isolates to achieve a balance other products simply can’t match,” said Rupert Heilmeier, Product Developer at True Nutrition Technology. “This approach delivers exceptional taste, minimal foaming, and a smooth, satisfying mouthfeel. Many Clear Whey products on the market have a noticeably dry or “chalky" taste profile — our formulation overcomes that limitation, which is why it stands out as one of the best in its category.”

 A Versatile Protein for Any Lifestyle CLEAR WHEY can be mixed with cold water or shaken with ice for a protein iced tea experience. Its refreshing taste profile has made it a favorite among:

 * Endurance athletes
* Strength and performance athletes
* Individuals seeking a low-calorie, high-protein soft drink alternative
* Anyone who dislikes thick, milky protein shakes

 Because it is lactose-free and extremely easy on digestion, CLEAR WHEY is also a preferred choice for individuals with sensitive stomachs.

 As demand continues to grow in the U.S., TNT plans to make CLEAR WHEY available to American consumers through Amazon, expanding access to its German-made, performance-driven protein products.
