# Celebrate “JoshStock” at Kushstock on April 19th

Phoenix, AZ (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Apr 16, 2025 @ 12:40 PM Pacific — Two icons of the legacy cannabis industry and culture – RAW® Rolling Papers and its visionary founder Josh Kesselman – are coming to Los Angeles at Kushstock on 4/19 to celebrate two major milestones – Josh’s birthday and the 20th Anniversary of RAW® and its place as a favorite rolling paper of the cannabis community.

“I can’t wait to see the Los Angeles community at Kushstock for our ‘highest’ of holidays!” says Kesselman, who is also CEO of [HBI Innovations](https://hbiinternational.com/), the company behind the [RAW®](https://rawthentic.com/) brand of rolling papers and accessories. “RAW wouldn’t be where it is today without events like Kushstock. This year is extra special as we are celebrating 20 years of RAW® and my birthday! There’s no place I’d rather be on April 19!” Kesselman will also be debuting the latest edition of the RAW® Fireblazer Helmet, his ingenious invention for the extreme cannabis blazer that allows the wearer to light and smoke six joints at the same time. As part of Kesselman’s RAW Giving initiative, Kesselman donated a portion of the proceeds of the initial rollout to a major animal rescue non-profit severely impacted by the Southern California wildfires earlier this year.

Tickets to Kushstock are free and can be reserved here at EventHi.
