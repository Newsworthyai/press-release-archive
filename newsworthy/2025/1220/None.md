Arlington, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Saturday Dec 20, 2025 @ 7:00 AM US/Central — In a new episode of The Building Texas Show, host Justin McKenzie sits down with Mayor Jim Ross of Arlington, Texas for a wide-ranging conversation about civic leadership, economic development, and how one of Texas’ most visible cities is quietly becoming one of its most future-focused.

 While Arlington is globally recognized for hosting marquee events at AT&T Stadium and Globe Life Field, Mayor Ross explains that the city’s true strength lies in its people, its welcoming culture, and its long-term commitment to innovation. From workforce development and higher education to aerospace manufacturing and startup growth, Arlington is positioning itself as a destination for both opportunity and inclusion.

 Mayor Ross shares his personal path into public service, emphasizing that mayors in many Texas cities serve largely as unpaid civic leaders motivated by love for their communities rather than financial reward. “You don’t do this for the paycheck,” Ross explains. “You do it because you care deeply about the place you call home.”

 The episode explores Arlington’s distinction as one of the most diverse cities in Texas, its ability to host massive global events such as the upcoming FIFA World Cup matches, and its growing role in advanced industries. Mayor Ross highlights the city’s partnership with aerospace and satellite manufacturing firms, redevelopment projects like Anthem in North Arlington, and efforts to retain engineering talent graduating from the University of Texas at Arlington.

 “Arlington was built to host the world,” Ross notes, pointing to the city’s track record of safely and successfully welcoming hundreds of thousands of visitors for major events—while continuing to invest in neighborhoods, education, and economic opportunity.

 Throughout the conversation, McKenzie frames Arlington as a case study in modern Texas city leadership: balancing global visibility with local impact, and pairing private-sector investment with strong public stewardship.
