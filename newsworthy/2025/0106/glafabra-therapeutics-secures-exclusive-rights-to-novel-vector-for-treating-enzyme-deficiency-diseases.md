# Glafabra Therapeutics Secures Exclusive Rights to Novel Vector for Treating Enzyme Deficiency Diseases.

Park City, Utah (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Jan 6, 2025 @ 7:00 AM US/Mountain — Glafabra Therapeutics, Inc. secures exclusive rights to yield-enhancing lentivector configuration from Medical College of Wisconsin. The cutting-edge technology behind this novel composition enables the creation of a lentivector-transgene combination with significantly higher packaging efficiency. The result is elevated titers in vector preparations, which leads to more efficient transformation of hematopoietic stem cells and a more potent cell therapy product is achieved.

According to Dr. Chris Hopkins, the CEO of Glafabra, "Access to this innovative vector backbone will allow the creation of more effective LV gene therapies and allow Glafabra to better address the unmet needs in enzyme deficiency diseases." This breakthrough development opens up new possibilities for the treatment of various genetic diseases, providing hope for patients in need of advanced medical solutions.

Patients who have undergone treatment with Glafabra's LV gene therapy for Fabry disease have reported remarkable improvements in their health and quality of life. One patient expressed their gratitude by stating, "The stem cell transplant with LV gene therapy has made me literally feel like I have no disease, and my life became so much more normalized than before."

Building on its success in Canadian clinical studies, Glafabra is now exploring opportunities to establish clinical sites in the USA. The company aims to introduce their clinically-demonstrated therapy for Fabry disease to American patients and ease their therapeutic burden with a one time transfusion that last for at least 5 years (for more detail see https://doi.org/10.1002/ctd2.70028). Furthermore, Glafabra is extending its platform approach to address a wide range of enzyme deficiency diseases, demonstrating its commitment to advancing medical innovation on a global scale.

Through strategic partnerships and innovative research collaborations, Glafabra Therapeutics continues to push the boundaries of genetic medicine, bringing cutting-edge treatments closer to those in need. Stay tuned for more updates as Glafabra works to revolutionize the field of gene therapy and improve the lives of patients worldwide.
