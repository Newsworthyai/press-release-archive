# WaterMalones CTO Team Leads Community Efforts to Secure MEXC Innovation Zone Listing

Toronto, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Sunday Jan 5, 2025 @ 8:00 PM America/Toronto — The WaterMalones CTO Team is proud to announce a remarkable collective effort by its growing community to maintain $WMN’s presence on MEXC Global. As the token undergoes a critical assessment period, the focus remains on achieving consistent daily trading volume, which is essential for securing $WMN’s place in the prestigious Innovation Zone.

Recent trading activity, surpassing $4,000 in daily volume, highlights the collective strength of the WaterMalones ecosystem. MEXC Global plays a pivotal role in providing $WMN with global visibility and liquidity. The current assessment period requires sustained trading performance, and the community’s commitment is already showing results.

Potential Outcomes of the Assessment Period

1. Innovation Zone Listing

Securing an Innovation Zone listing would unlock new opportunities for market growth and investor engagement.

2. Delisting Risks

Failure to meet benchmarks would pivot $WMN to alternative platforms like PancakeSwap and LBank.

3. Extended Assessment

MEXC may extend the evaluation timeline, giving the community additional time to demonstrate trading viability.

“The WaterMalones community is the driving force behind our success,” said the WaterMalones CTO Team. “This is a moment to showcase the power of collaboration and commitment. Together, we’re ensuring $WMN’s presence on MEXC and other global platforms.”Looking ahead, the WaterMalones CTO Team is launching an aggressive marketing campaign, including influencer collaborations and cross-platform promotions, to solidify $WMN’s long-term accessibility and liquidity.
