# Critical Gap Emerges Between Mental Health Needs and Support in the Workplace — New Study by HR.com Research Institute

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Jun 30, 2025 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — A new research report, HR.com's State of Employee Mental Health & Stress in the Workplace 2025, reveals a troubling disconnect between employee mental health needs and the support offered by organizations. While 89% of organizations provide mental health benefits, far fewer are actually equipped to help employees manage stress and mental health challenges in meaningful ways.

A staggering 61% of respondents say they often feel personally stressed at work—yet only 28% believe their organizations are effective at helping employees manage that stress. Less than half of companies have systems in place to respond effectively to mental health issues among employees.

While 45% of respondents believe their organizations go beyond benefits to truly address mental health challenges, 34% actively disagree—a 15-point change from last year. This sharp decline signals a worsening trend that organizations can no longer ignore. Just 9% of organizations have any way to measure employee mental health, leaving most employers without the insights needed to track progress or improve support.

Further analysis uncovers several key findings that highlight the severity of the issue. Only 15% managers are equipped to guide employees who are experiencing stress. Even fewer—just 14%— agree that managers in their organizations are able to recognize signs of employee stress. Additionally, only 35% of respondents say their work environment actively supports mental health.

This lack of manager readiness compounds the problem: most managers are unequipped to identify stress, intervene early, or support mental wellness, despite being on the front lines of employee experience.

“The message is clear,” said Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator and CEO of HR.com. “Mental health programs aren’t enough. Organizations must prioritize culture, manager training, and leadership accountability to close this critical gap.”
