About Pratesi

Pratesi’s story began with love and craftsmanship. In 1906, Remigio Pratesi, a young wine merchant, founded the house in Tuscany after commissioning an extraordinary set of embroidered linen for his bride-to-be. This gesture marked the start of a legacy in Italian luxury.

Today, Pratesi’s collections are crafted exclusively in Italy, using the finest Egyptian cotton. Renowned for their softness, refinement, and durability, these linens epitomise the harmony of tradition and innovation, making Pratesi a global symbol of luxury living.
