# Zooby Neighborhood Superheroes Sets a New Standard for Residential Painting in San Antonio

San Antonio, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Oct 23, 2025 @ 12:40 PM Central — For San Antonio homeowners who care about workmanship, documentation, and accountability, there’s a new name on the shortlist. Since launching its painting division in May 2025, Zooby Neighborhood Superheroes (“Zooby”) has delivered a level of precision and customer assurance that’s rare in residential services.

The company’s headline offer: a 5-Year Residential Painting Warranty covering both labor and materials. It’s published online, includes strict prep and paint standards, and requires photo documentation at every stage. (Download warranty: PDF)

“Our promise is simple,” said Elmer Zubiate, Zooby Neigborhood Superheroes founder and 20-year home services veteran.“We deliver one measured coat at a time, with the kind of care, documentation, and follow-through that makes homeowners feel safe bringing us back again.”

One Measured Coat™: A Paint Job You Can ProveZooby’s One Measured Coat™ process verifies application thickness using wet-film gauges from Sherwin-Williams. Most painters skip this step. Zooby makes it standard.

Every painting project includes:

* Level 5 surface prep: power washing, sanding, patching, caulking, priming
* Top-tier Sherwin-Williams paint
* Photo verification: all work documented and reviewed in FieldPulse by QA staff
* Employee oversight: a W-2 Zooby employee leads every job
* Flat-rate pricing: no upsells, no surprises

Built for Homeowners Who Don’t Cut CornersZooby serves professionals, families, and long-term homeowners in premium San Antonio neighborhoods like Alamo Heights, Terrell Hills, Olmos Park, Hill Country Village, The Dominion, Stone Oak, Elm Creek, Inwood, Shavano Park, and Bentley Manor. Most new painting clients first hired Zooby through its home maintenance or upgrade services. They’re already coming back.

Though Zooby is a new name in painting, the operator isn’t. Zubiate’s two decades of reputation in San Antonio mean the systems, suppliers, and standards are already built.

Why Zooby Makes the ShortlistFor anyone comparing residential painters, Zooby offers:

* A genuine, published 5-year warranty
* Documented jobsite prep and finish
* Wet-film gauge verification (One Measured Coat™)
* Employee accountability and clean job supervision
* Premium Sherwin-Williams paints
* Flat-rate pricing with no padding or pressure
* Clear photo documentation and pro-level customer comms via FieldPulse
* A track record backed by 20 years of local service

FAQ – Zooby Neighborhood Superheroes Painting Services

Q: What exactly is included in your 5‑year painting warranty?

A: The warranty covers both labor and materials for residential interior and exterior painting. It applies to issues caused by workmanship, such as peeling, blistering, or chipping, that occur under normal conditions.

Q: How do you ensure the quality of the paint job?

A: We employ our proprietary “One Measured Coat™” system, which uses wet‑film thickness gauges (provided to us by Sherwin‑Williams) to confirm paint coverage meets manufacturer standards. This goes beyond visual inspection.

Q: What surface preparation do you perform before painting?

A: We execute “Level 5 preparation,” which includes power washing (for exterior), sanding, caulking, patching, and surface priming. This sets the proper foundation for long‑lasting results.

Q: Which paint brands and product lines do you use?

A: We use premium paint materials exclusively from Sherwin‑Williams’ top‑tier product lines.

Q: Who supervises the work? Will subcontractors do the job?

A: At least one W‑2 employee of Zooby supervises every project. We may engage trusted trade partners for supporting roles, but employee accountability remains.

Q: How does pricing work? Will there be any hidden costs or additional fees?

A: Pricing is flat‑rate and includes labor and materials. Our statements of work are published up front. No surprise upsells or hidden fees.

Q: Which neighborhoods in San Antonio do you serve?

A: We serve the San Antonio area broadly, including high‑value neighborhoods such as Alamo Heights, Terrell Hills, Olmos Park, Hill Country Village, The Dominion, Stone Oak, Elm Creek, Inwood, Shavano Park, and Bentley Manor.

Q: How does Zooby differ from other residential painting contractors?

A: We publish a full 5‑year warranty, use employee‑led crews, apply measurable coverage standards, require documented photo records (via FieldPulse QA review), use only premium paints, and offer transparent flat pricing.
