# ORGANA International Expands Accessibility — Now Available on Amazon.com

Springville, UT (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Oct 23, 2025 @ 2:10 PM US/Mountain — ORGANA International, a pioneer in natural mineral-based wellness since 1997, announced today that its complete line of products is now available for purchase on Amazon.com. The move marks a significant milestone in the company’s mission to make its natural, earth-derived wellness solutions accessible to health-conscious consumers across the United States.

“For 30 years, ORGANA has been helping people restore what modern diets and depleted soils have taken away,” said Larry Mills, CEO of ORGANA International. “Making our products available on Amazon allows anyone, anywhere, to easily access the benefits of our mineral-rich, bioavailable formulas. This expansion helps fulfill our promise of putting better health within everyone’s reach.”Bringing Natural Wellness to More PeopleORGANA’s growing popularity stems from its unique formulations, which deliver 76 trace minerals and fulvic acid in a living, bioavailable state. Unlike synthetic supplements, ORGANA’s products are naturally derived from decomposed plant matter and tested under a microscope for Brownian movement — proof that the particles are active and “alive.” At just 20 nanometers in size, the minerals can penetrate the skin barrier and reach the cellular level, supporting optimal absorption and effectiveness.

The company’s flagship product, the ORGANA Multi-Mineral Drink, provides a convenient way to replenish daily nutrients, while its broader line includes magnesium cream, liquid oxygen, silver-based immune support, and detoxifying Essiac tea. All formulations use pharmaceutical-grade water and natural ingredients to ensure safety, purity, and performance.

The company’s “customer-first” philosophy continues to guide every aspect of its operations.
