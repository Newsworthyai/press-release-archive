# Beyond Brick and Mortar: How NPI Helps Health Brands Win in an Omnichannel World

Boca Raton, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Oct 23, 2025 @ 8:00 AM US/Eastern — The line between online and in-store shopping has vanished. For health and wellness brands, success now depends on mastering both sides of the retail equation — and everything in between.

Under the leadership of Founder and CEO Mitch Gould, Nutritional Products International (NPI) has evolved its proprietary “Evolution of Distribution” platform to help brands thrive in this new omnichannel environment — where visibility, pricing, and logistics must align seamlessly across Amazon, Walmart, Walgreens, and traditional retail shelves alike.

“The question isn’t ‘Amazon or Walmart?’ anymore,” said Gould, whose career spans from the rise of big-box retail in the 1980s to helping launch Amazon’s health and wellness category in the early 2000s. “It’s ‘How do we win everywhere consumers shop?’ Today’s brands need one coordinated strategy that connects every channel into a unified customer journey.”The New Retail RealitySeventy-three percent of shoppers now use multiple channels before making a purchase — often researching online, buying in-store, and re-ordering digitally.

“Consumer habits changed permanently after COVID-19,” Gould explained. “E-commerce growth jumped five years ahead of projections, yet brick-and-mortar didn’t die — it adapted. The winners are the brands that show up consistently across every touchpoint with synchronized pricing, messaging, and availability.”Five Retail Ecosystems NPI Manages for Clients1. E-Commerce Marketplaces — The Digital Foundation

NPI brings deep experience across Amazon and Walmart.com — the twin engines of online health and wellness. Gould was instrumental in placing more than 150 brands on Amazon in the early 2000s and continues to guide companies through listing optimization, Buy Box strategy, compliance, and advertising performance.

“Every platform has its own rules,” Gould said. “We tailor each listing, image, and keyword to fit what actually converts on that site.”2. Mass Market Retail — The Power of Physical Presence

In-store placement at major chains such as Walmart, Target, CVS, Walgreens, Kroger, Albertsons, and Publix remains vital for brand legitimacy and consumer trust.

“Seeing your product on a shelf signals that a retailer has vetted you,” said Gould. “That credibility drives conversion online too.”NPI helps brands navigate slotting fees, planogram strategy, and promotional velocity to stay on shelves and grow sell-through.

3. Specialty Health Retail — Where Expertise Meets Innovation

Retailers like Vitamin Shoppe, GNC, Sprouts, and Whole Foods attract educated shoppers seeking premium, clinically backed products. NPI positions brands for these audiences with in-store education materials, sampling programs, and staff training tools.

“Specialty retail is the proving ground for innovation,” Gould noted. “It’s where emerging brands earn credibility before scaling to mass retail.”4. Club Stores — Bulk Value, Big Visibility

Costco, Sam’s Club, and BJ’s require distinct pricing, packaging, and demo programs. NPI’s experience with test runs, seasonal buying calendars, and in-store roadshows helps brands break into this highly profitable but complex segment.

“Even in bulk, club stores run on impulse,” said Gould. “Your packaging has to shout value in one glance.”5. Direct-to-Consumer — Owning the Relationship

NPI helps brands connect retail presence with owned channels through QR codes, registration programs, and loyalty initiatives that turn one-time retail shoppers into lifelong customers.

“Retail builds awareness; DTC builds relationships,” Gould said. “The strongest brands do both.”Navigating Omnichannel Pricing and ComplexityMaintaining price integrity across platforms is one of the hardest challenges brands face.

“Amazon enforces price parity; brick-and-mortar chains don’t want to be Amazon showrooms,” Gould explained. “We build strategies using exclusive SKUs, MAP policies, and promotional calendars that protect all sides.”NPI’s integrated model covers every moving part — from inventory management and data analytics to coordinated marketing calendars — ensuring consistent execution across online and offline channels.

Case Study: Coordinated Launch SuccessRecently, NPI guided an international collagen brand into the U.S. market with a synchronized rollout across five retail ecosystems. Within 90 days, the company secured Amazon Brand Registry, placement in 4,500 CVS locations, a specialty chain listing, Costco roadshow approval, and a fully integrated DTC site.

The outcome: first-year revenue beat projections by 240%, and visibility in one channel fueled momentum in others.

“That’s the omnichannel advantage,” Gould said. “Each channel amplifies the others when everything works together.”Looking Ahead: The Future of Retail ConvergenceGould sees the next evolution already underway:

* Retail Media Networks turning retailer data into high-ROI ad platforms.
* Same-Day Fulfillment through Amazon, Walmart, and Instacart partnerships.
* Social Commerce driven by TikTok Shop and livestream retail.
* Smart Packaging connecting physical products to digital experiences.

“Retail will only get more complex,” Gould concluded. “But complexity creates opportunity. Brands that manage it strategically — and integrate every moving part — build the kind of advantage competitors can’t easily copy.”The NPI Omnichannel AdvantageThrough its Evolution of Distribution platform, NPI provides brands with turnkey omnichannel capabilities, including:

* Simultaneous online and retail launches
* Channel-specific SKU and pricing strategy

“We effectively become the U.S. headquarters for international and domestic brands,” said Gould. “After 40 years, I’ve seen retail change constantly — but the fundamentals never do.
