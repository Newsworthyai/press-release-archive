# Superior Insurance Advisors Launches Midwest-Wide Employer Pharma-Funds Recovery Drive

Gary, IN (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Oct 23, 2025 @ 4:44 AM US/Central — Superior Insurance Advisors (SIA) today announced the launch of a Midwest-wide Employer Pharma-Funds Recovery Drive, a large-scale initiative helping employers, municipalities, and benefit trusts claim their share of the Department of Justice’s $600 billion Pharma Overcharge Recovery Fund.

The effort, spearheaded by Paul H. Flowers Jr. — a nationally recognized fiduciary-certified healthcare advisor and three-time best-selling author — aims to bring transparency and justice to a system long plagued by overpricing, pharmacy-benefit collusion, and misaligned incentives. The campaign also positions Gary, Indiana, as a regional hub for healthcare accountability and multi-state cooperation across the Midwest.

“This is a defining moment for business leaders,” said Flowers. “For too long, the truth about drug pricing has been buried under layers of middlemen and conflicts of interest. Employers finally have the opportunity to take back what’s theirs.” The Department of Justice and several states have filed and consolidated lawsuits, including Insulin Pricing Litigation, alleging that major pharmaceutical manufacturers and PBMs—such as Prime Therapeutics (Blue Cross), Optum (United Healthcare), CVS Caremark (Aetna), and Express Scripts (Cigna)—systematically inflated prices.

Recovery efforts are being supported by national legal teams like Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP, Keller Rohrback LLP, and Pearl Logic LLC. The fund allows self-insured employers, unions, and municipal plans to submit claims for reimbursement of excess payments going back more than a decade. The cutoff for insulin-related claims is January 15, 2026, and the newly announced cutoff for generic medications is November 15, 2025.

Flowers warns that “employers who fail to act now will leave millions of dollars on the table.” In partnership with Life Health & Legal Education Partners (LHALEP), Superior Insurance Advisors is hosting a series of open-access workshops to educate CFOs, HR leaders, and municipal administrators on claim eligibility, data collection, and filing strategies.

“This is about restoring fiduciary stewardship to healthcare,” Flowers explained. “We’re not just recovering dollars — we’re rewriting the rules of fairness in American benefits.”The initiative briefly aligns with Opioid Free America, helping cities and counties responsibly utilize national opioid settlement grants to reduce dependence and improve community health outcomes.

Media Availability Media professionals are invited to contact Paul H. Flowers Jr. for live interviews and press briefings.

Given the short timeline before the federal claim deadline, coverage is considered time-sensitive and of public interest.
