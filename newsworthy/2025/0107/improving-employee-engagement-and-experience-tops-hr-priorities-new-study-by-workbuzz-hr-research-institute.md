# Improving Employee Engagement and Experience Tops HR Priorities - New Study by Workbuzz & HR Research Institute

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Jan 7, 2025 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — According to new research from Workbuzz and HR.com’s HR Research Institute, enhancing employee engagement and experience is currently the foremost priority among HR professionals. However, this focus doesn’t exist in isolation. HR leaders also prioritize boosting worker productivity, attracting top talent, fostering a positive organizational culture, and promoting employee well-being.

The research also shows that better communication plays a role in addressing these HR priorities. It looks at both survey frequency and communication with frontline workers, who are typically harder to reach because they lack designated offices and computers. It turns out there is a positive correlation between the frequency of employee surveys and organizational success in key HR areas. Companies conducting surveys at least quarterly report significantly greater improvements in:

* Retention: 53% versus 21% for those surveying less frequently.
* Talent Attraction: 58% versus 27%.
* Productivity and Performance: 62% versus 30%.
* Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB): 64% versus 43%.

The study also found that organizations that say their employee experience and engagement levels rose over the last year are much more likely to say it is easy or very easy to communicate with frontline workers (70% versus 20%). The bottom line is that better communication may well help drive improvements among these other top HR priorities.

“Employee engagement and communication are more than just buzzwords; they are a cornerstone of organizational success,” said Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator and CEO of HR.com. “Organizations that prioritize them not only tend to retain their top talent better but also tend to see measurable improvements in productivity and overall performance. When employees feel heard and valued, businesses thrive.”“Annual surveys are a start, but they’re not enough in today’s fast-paced workplace,” added Ryan Tahmassebi, People Science Director, WorkBuzz. “Organizations that create real-time feedback loops and maintain open communication channels are better equipped to respond to employee needs and drive engagement.”The full research report, Trends in Employee Engagement 24/25, is available for free download and offers a detailed look at engagement practices and strategies to provide actionable insights to help HR practitioners and leaders to develop more sophisticated approaches that meet future needs.
