# Ed Howie and Justin McKenzie Champion Branding, Storytelling, and Economic Impact Across Texas

Boerne, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Feb 25, 2025 @ 7:00 AM US/Central — In today’s hyper-competitive business environment, branding is no longer just about marketing—it’s about movement-building. Few understand this better than Ed Howie, founder of BTY Creative, and Justin McKenzie, entrepreneur, media producer, and host of The Building Texas Show. Through their work with brands across Texas and beyond, they are proving that the key to business growth isn’t just about products—it’s about purpose.

Howie, whose career includes work with Chick-fil-A, H-E-B, and Greater: SATX, has built BTY Creative into a strategic force that helps companies define and amplify their boldest, truest identities. His philosophy is simple: brands that communicate their story with clarity and authenticity outperform those that rely on transactional marketing alone.

"If people don’t know you have it, they can’t buy it," says Howie. "The best businesses don’t just sell products—they create impact. They make customers, employees, and communities feel something. That’s what we do at BTY: we help businesses tap into their boldest, truest selves and turn that into real-world influence."This philosophy extends to The Wonder of woooo, Howie’s podcast, where he shares insights into branding, leadership, and consumer behavior. His conversations explore how businesses, from startups to legacy brands, can craft compelling narratives that drive both engagement and loyalty.

Justin McKenzie: Building Texas Through Stories and StrategyMcKenzie, a regional business leader and a Founding Partner of Das GreenHaus, is taking a similar approach through The Building Texas Show, where he showcases the untold stories of Texas entrepreneurs, small-town economic revival, and industry disruptors. Through in-depth interviews, McKenzie highlights how businesses can scale by blending smart strategy with authentic storytelling.

"Entrepreneurship isn’t just about having a great idea—it’s about knowing how to tell your story in a way that attracts the right partners, customers, and investors," McKenzie says. "That’s what I focus on with The Building Texas Show—bringing those stories to life and connecting founders with the ecosystems that can help them grow."McKenzie’s work extends beyond media into real-world impact. With Das GreenHaus, he is actively fostering innovation by helping startups navigate the complexities of business growth, from securing investment to brand positioning. He has also been instrumental in strategic initiatives across Texas, including his involvement with regional economic development efforts like Greater: SATX.

Branding as a Catalyst for Business SuccessHowie and McKenzie’s collaboration underscores a critical shift in today’s business landscape: strong branding isn’t an afterthought—it’s the foundation for success.

"A business without a clear identity is like a ship without a rudder," Howie explains. "It doesn’t matter how great your product or service is—if you can’t articulate why it matters, you’ll struggle to scale. That’s where we come in. We help businesses own their story and amplify it in a way that drives real impact."This principle was evident in Howie’s branding work with Greater: SATX, where his team developed the "Greater: SATX" identity—anchored by a strategic pause (the colon) that invites businesses to fill in the blank.

"That pause wasn’t just a design choice—it was an intentional branding strategy," Howie explains. "It gives the audience room to envision what 'greater' means for them—whether it’s greater opportunities, greater jobs, or greater collaboration."It’s this level of strategic thinking that McKenzie and Howie believe is essential for entrepreneurs, whether they are launching a startup, repositioning an existing business, or revitalizing an entire community.

Looking Ahead: The Future of Storytelling and Business GrowthAs BTY Creative, The Wonder of Wooo, and The Building Texas Show continue to expand their reach, Howie and McKenzie are committed to helping businesses turn their brands into movements.

"The future belongs to businesses that don’t just compete on product, but on purpose," McKenzie says. "The ones that win are those that know how to connect their story with their audience in a way that resonates."With Texas emerging as a national leader in business innovation, Howie and McKenzie are positioning themselves—and the companies they work with—at the forefront of this shift.

For entrepreneurs, CEOs, and investors looking to grow with intention, their message is clear: own your story, amplify your impact, and build something greater.
