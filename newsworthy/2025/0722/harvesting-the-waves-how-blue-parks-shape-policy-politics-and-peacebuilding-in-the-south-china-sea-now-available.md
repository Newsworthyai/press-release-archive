# "Harvesting the Waves: How Blue Parks Shape Policy, Politics and Peacebuilding in the South China Sea" Now Available

Columbia, South Carolina (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Jul 22, 2025 @ 5:00 AM Eastern — The challenges of preserving marine biodiversity and fostering peace in contested waters take center stage in James Borton's latest book, Harvesting the Waves: How Blue Parks Shape Policy, Politics and Peacebuilding in the South China Sea.

Released on May 15, 2025, this timely work reignites a critical conversation that began with Borton’s earlier research on the role of science diplomacy and marine science cooperation in the South China Sea.

Building on his earlier findings, Borton provides groundbreaking insights into the transformative potential of networked MPAs, or "blue parks," as tools for both conservation and conflict resolution. This book is not just an extension of his research—it offers innovative ideas and actionable solutions to encourage collaboration among South China Sea coastal states.

Harvesting the Waves is more than a scholarly examination; it is an urgent rallying cry for policymakers, scientists, and conservationists worldwide to protect the oceans.

A Call to Action in the Decade of the OceanMarine protected areas (MPAs) are essential components of integrated ecosystem management, particularly in the Decade of the Ocean. Borton meticulously details the threats facing the South China Sea, from overfishing and government subsidies to destructive practices like large-scale clam harvesting and dredging. He highlights the importance of safeguarding the region, which accounts for nearly 10% of the global fish catch and supports six million livelihoods.

Drawing inspiration from successful MPA networks in other regions, such as the Mediterranean, Borton showcases how science-based cooperation can address transboundary challenges. His analysis of the Mediterranean Action Plan serves as a blueprint, demonstrating how legal instruments and regional monitoring can protect marine ecosystems while fostering international collaboration.

Webinar Insights and Global ImplicationsBorton's leadership at the July 2024 webinar, “Blue Parks Offer a Promising Model for Peacebuilding in Transboundary Water Issues,” brought together leading experts to discuss the role of MPAs in easing geopolitical tensions. The event highlighted success stories like the Red Sea Peace Park initiative between Israel and Jordan, illustrating how MPAs can serve as instruments of diplomacy and cooperation.

Policy Recommendations and Global GoalsThe book’s recommendations are closely aligned with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, which targets the conservation of 30% of marine and coastal areas by 2030. Borton advocates for the establishment of a regional conservation forum, modeled on the successful MedPAN network in the Mediterranean, to promote cooperation among South China Sea claimant nations. This proposed platform encourages collective stewardship of marine biodiversity, fostering a shared commitment to preserving one of the world's most ecologically significant and politically sensitive marine regions.
