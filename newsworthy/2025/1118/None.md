# How Are Veterans Getting Mobility Support in Central Texas? Community Partners Step Up at a Field of Honor Ceremony

Georgetown, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Nov 18, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Central — At the Ninth Annual Field of Honor in Georgetown, TX where more than 2,000 flags honored military members and first responders, A Place At Home - North Austin and the ShareTheWill Foundation came together to honor a Vietnam veteran with two meaningful gifts: a motorized wheelchair and a personalized quilt stitched with his name, rank, and service history.

 How Did This Veteran Receive a Wheelchair and Custom Quilt at the Field of Honor? The ceremony took place among rows of waving flags and families who came to pay tribute. The veteran was surprised with both a power wheelchair and a custom quilt that recognized his service. This gift represents the 40th motorized wheelchair or scooter donated through the ongoing partnership between A Place At Home- North Austin and ShareTheWill Foundation.

 Why Is This Partnership So Important to the Eisenberg Family? For Stacey Eisenberg and her husband Bryan, co-owners of A Place At Home - North Austin, this mission began when a local medical lending closet they supported closed two years ago. They wanted to make sure the community never lost access to essential mobility equipment. They were introduced to Will Williams shortly after. Their children are also actively involved, making this a full family effort to serve veterans, seniors, and neighbors in need.

 Who Is Behind Share the Will and How Do They Help the Community Year-Round? ShareTheWill was founded by Will Williams, a 26-year Army veteran and former Ranger who has devoted his post-service life to supporting Central Texas families. The organization has no paid staff and brings hundreds of volunteers to its mission. Every dollar goes directly into community impact, from mobility equipment to back to school backpacks and running shoes, July 4th parades, 3500 Thanksgiving meals, sponsoring more than 4,000 families at Christmas, Honor Flight Austin, Field of Honor and many more community initiatives.

 How Did Local Partners Work Together to Make This Gift Possible? While Mobility City in Cedar Park contributed a wheelchair for this event, the core ongoing partnership remains between A Place At Home North Austin and ShareTheWill Foundation. Together they are continuing to fill critical gaps left behind when the lending closet closed. We continue to look for other corporate sponsors as well.

 “This is the heart of Williamson County. When our community comes together to lift up a veteran, it reminds us of our shared values. We don’t simply say we support one another — we step forward and prove” — Russ Boles, Williamson County Commissioner
