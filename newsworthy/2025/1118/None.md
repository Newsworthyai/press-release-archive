# Global Psychedelic Week 2025 Concludes with 5,000 Participants from 100+ Countries

San Francisco, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Nov 18, 2025 @ 6:10 PM America/Toronto — The inaugural Global Psychedelic Week 2025 has officially concluded, marking a historic moment for the international psychedelic community. From November 3–9, thousands of participants joined a seven-day global celebration of healing, equity, and cultural transformation, connecting voices across continents through shared purpose and vision.

 With 140 speakers across 32 sessions, the online program ran with exceptional precision — the maximum delay was just three minutes — featuring scientists, Indigenous leaders, therapists, artists, and entrepreneurs shaping the future of psychedelics. Beyond the screen, the movement came alive through 105 in-person events in over 100 countries, bringing together more than 5,000 participants in community gatherings, workshops, and ceremonies spanning every continent.

 “Global Psychedelic Week was not an event, it was a living proof that psychedelics are here to stay,” said Milica Radovic Mandic, Co-Founder of Global Psychedelic Week. “We witnessed scientists, Indigenous elders, therapists, artists, and seekers coming together from over a hundred countries to share knowledge and healing. Every conversation, every gathering, every moment carried the same pulse, love, reciprocity, and awakening. What touched me most was seeing how decentralized this movement has become: people hosting circles, ceremonies, and meetups all around the world. It reminded us that transformation doesn’t belong to one place, it belongs to all of us.”

 Co-Founder Dennis Walker added, “The inaugural Global Psychedelic Week achieved a level of international diplomacy and cross-border cooperation that is rare in any discipline, especially in today’s world. We saw indigenous wisdom keepers sit side by side with world renowned scientists and policy experts to engage in diplomatic, solution-oriented dialogue about hot button issues such as indigenous intellectual property rights, ethics around psychedelic medicalization, the role of psychedelic therapies in addressing trauma in war zones, and much more. We didn’t fully arrive at every answer to every burning question underlying this era of psychedelic mainstreaming, but that was never the point: we achieved civil discourse around psychedelic science and culture on a global scale, and seeded an unprecedented level of opportunity for international cooperation and cross-pollination among the rapidly growing global psychedelic community and industry.”

 The energy throughout the week was described by attendees as “100% vibe, heart, and love”, a reflection of the growing global momentum toward connection, reciprocity, and healing.

 Recordings of all sessions will soon be available for replay. To stay informed and access updates, visit globalpsychedelicweek.com and sign up for the newsletter.

 Global Psychedelic Week will return November 2–8, 2026 — continuing to bridge science and spirit, tradition and innovation, local communities and global consciousness.
