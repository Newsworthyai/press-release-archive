# IMA Launches “Smart Moms Ask” Nationwide Campaign to Stop mRNA COVID Shots for Kids & Pregnant Women

Washington, DC (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday May 13, 2025 @ 9:15 AM Pacific — The Independent Medical Alliance (IMA) today launched “Smart Moms Ask,” a powerful nationwide campaign mobilizing mothers to demand that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the CDC remove mRNA COVID-19 vaccines from the childhood immunization schedule and halt their use in infants, children, and pregnant women.

Campaign Rallies Moms to Confront HHS and Congress on Alarming mRNA RisksBuilding on its highly effective national grassroots activism which helped secure HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s confirmation, the IMA’s new “Smart Moms Ask” campaign rallies moms to challenge a medical system that has ignored the growing body of vaccine injury data from COVID mRNA shots.

“Moms are the fiercest protectors of their children, yet they’ve been bullied into accepting mRNA shots with devastating risks,” said Dr. Kat Lindley, IMA Fellowship Program Director and mother of five. “This campaign unites their voices to demand HHS and CDC act now to safeguard our kids and expectant mothers.”Alarming studies fuel the campaign’s urgency:* 9.5 million U.S. children aged 6 months to 17 years have received the COVID-19 mRNA shot as of April 19, 2025
* 620% increase in myocarditis among young men post-vaccination, raising questions about safety in adolescent populations as sourced in a 2025 peer-reviewed study.
* Miscarriage rates as high as 81% compared to an average rate of 13% have been reported in a Pfizer Patient Safety study.
* ~33% lower successful conception for vaccinated women were compared to unvaccinated women in 2022.

“There is no ethical or scientific case for exposing healthy children and pregnant women to these risks,” said Dr. Joseph Varon, IMA President and Chief Medical Officer. “HHS and CDC must act swiftly to protect our most vulnerable.”The “Smart Moms Ask” campaign’s petition drive mobilizes moms and concerned citizens to demand that HHS remove mRNA vaccines from pediatric and prenatal recommendations, with signatures to be presented to Secretary Kennedy at HHS and Members of Congress.
