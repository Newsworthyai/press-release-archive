# AIX (AI Exchange) Shifts Focus to AI’s Impact on Employee Wellbeing, Readiness, and Performance

South Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Jul 28, 2025 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — AIX (Artificial Intelligence Exchange), a dedicated community developed in partnership with HR.com, today announced a strategic shift to focus on AI’s impact on individual wellbeing, company culture, and readiness. AIX’s overarching goal is to bring together leaders, AI experts, and HR peers to exchange experiences and seek guidance on cultivating mentally resilient, emotionally intelligent, and professionally adaptable workforces in an AI-augmented world.

As organizations automate, optimize, and transform roles using AI, the real questions go well beyond the latest tools and hacks - they’re personal, behavioral, and cultural:

* How can organizations sustain employee wellbeing and engagement as AI accelerates the pace of work?
* What strategies help foster psychological safety and growth amid constant change?
* How can employees reimagine their value as traditional roles evolve?
* What soft skills will define leadership and employee success in the AI era?
* How can organizations prepare people for continuous learning and redefinition?

“AI will increasingly touch every corner of the employee experience—from hiring to training, from task management to team dynamics,” said Charles Epstein, AIX co-founder and Managing Director. “Its impact on employee well-being, readiness, engagement, and performance will be profound. Whether that impact is positive or harmful depends largely on how HR and leaders across the organization prepare for it. This begins by raising our individual and collective AIQs, which we define as knowing what questions to ask.”AIX Components* AIXonHR.com is a collaborative space for HR and business leaders, mental and behavioral health and wellness practitioners, and HR tech solution providers to share experiences, ask questions, and co-develop strategies that are both human-centered and AI-aware.
* AIX Files is a weekly Substack newsletter that provides “news, perspectives, predictions, and provocations” on the broad impacts of AI on well-being, readiness, and performance.
* Weekly blogs, such as this week’s article, “Now It's Personal: AIX Shifts Focus to AI’s Impact on Employee Wellbeing, Readiness, and Performance," explore timely topics at the intersection of HR and technology.
* The AIX Factor Podcast features conversations with HR and business leaders, behavioral scientists, technologists, and wellness experts that probe the real-world effects of AI on people and work culture. Background info on rotating co-hosts and their specialties.
* Bag Check is a popular standalone segment where guests unpack their must-have AI tools shaping the way they work.

“While we must prepare for AI’s impact on core HR functions—payroll, talent acquisition, learning, total rewards—developing strategies for cultivating resilience and driving professional growth will be the key determinants of how successfully organizations navigate the world of AI-augmented work,” said Debbie McGrath, HR.com founder and CEO. “We’re excited about this strategic shift and have the perfect person to lead AIX in Charles Epstein—a marketer, writer, and podcaster who has worked with some of the most innovative vendors, organizations, and leaders in the wellness, behavioral health, and AI/worktech space.”For more about AIX, visit www.aixonhr.com.
