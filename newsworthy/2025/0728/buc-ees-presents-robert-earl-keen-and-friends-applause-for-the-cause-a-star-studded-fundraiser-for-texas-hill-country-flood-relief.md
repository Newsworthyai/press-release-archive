# Buc-ee’s Presents Robert Earl Keen and Friends: Applause for the Cause – A Star-Studded Fundraiser for Texas Hill Country Flood Relief

New Braunfels, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Jul 28, 2025 @ 1:20 PM Central — Legendary Texas troubadour Robert Earl Keen is rallying his fellow artists for a one-night-only benefit concert in support of his beloved Hill Country. On August 28th, Whitewater Amphitheater in New Braunfels, TX will host “Applause for the Cause,” a flood relief fundraiser featuring a once-in-a-lifetime lineup of Americana, country, and Red Dirt favorites.

Headlined by Keen and special guest Tyler Childers, the event will showcase a rare trio performance by Miranda Lambert, Jon Randall, and Jack Ingram, plus appearances by Cross Canadian Ragweed, Ryan Bingham, Randy Rogers, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Hayes Carll, Jamey Johnson, and many more.

All proceeds benefit the Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country, supporting families and communities impacted by the devastating July 4th floods in Kerr County.

“This is a star-studded lineup with music starting in the mid-afternoon and lasting far into the night,” says Keen. “We must help everyone as much as we can, for as long as we can.”Tickets are on sale now at whitewaterrocks.com. Reserved seats are $200, general admission is $99, and 100% of proceeds go directly to the Community Foundation. Attendees can also purchase and gift tickets to local first responders—whether attending or not.

Doors open at 3 PM, kicking off with Lloyd Maines and his Austin City Limits Band featuring special guest vocalists. As the sun sets, expect electrifying full-band sets from some of the biggest names in roots music, with a special closing set by Keen and Childers.

A Community Effort with Statewide SupportThe event is made possible by Buc-ee’s, which has already pledged $1 million to the Community Foundation. “The tragedies are beyond belief,” says Buc-ee’s founder Beaver Aplin. “Teaming with Robert Earl Keen and friends just seemed like the right thing to do.”

Additional sponsors include Whitewater Amphitheater, Miller Pro AVL, C.C. Creations, and artist Dorothy Nottingham.

Renowned Cowboy Auctioneer Heath Hale Joins Applause for the CauseIn addition to the star-studded musical lineup, Applause for the Cause will feature a high-energy live auction led by the renowned Cowboy Auctioneer Heath Hale, founder of Cowboy Auctioneer. Donating his time and talents, Heath and the Cowboy Auctioneer Team will take the stage to help raise even more for flood relief efforts in the Texas Hill Country.
