# Sun Theory Ranks No. 644 on the 2025 Inc. 5000 List of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies

Austin, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Aug 12, 2025 @ 11:20 AM US/Central — Inc. today announced that Sun Theory has ranked No. 644 on the 2025 Inc. 5000 list, the most prestigious ranking of the fastest-growing private companies in America. The list represents a unique look at the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—independent businesses.

Sun Theory, a wellness-focused consumer brand platform recognized for its award-winning brands and fully integrated operations across manufacturing and retail, achieved over 650% revenue growth from 2021 to 2024. During this period of rapid national expansion, the company scaled its team from 31 to over 200 employees, driven by strong consumer demand and a commitment to quality at every stage of the supply chain.

“This milestone is a validation of the strategy we’ve pursued from day one, building a resilient, brand-led platform that prioritizes clean ingredients, operational rigor, and capital efficiency,” said Connor Oman, Chief Executive Officer of Sun Theory. “In a volatile industry, we’ve stayed committed to long-term value creation, entering only those markets where the margin structure is attractive and the regulatory path is clear. As we scale, our goal is not only to grow revenue, but to shape the future of wellness through intentional expansion into cannabis, hemp, and functional health products.” Founded in 2016 and headquartered in Austin, Texas, Sun Theory operates a growing portfolio of retail dispensaries and consumer brands. Its lineup includes Dialed In Gummies, an award-winning line of solventless rosin-based edibles currently available in 3 states, including Colorado, Missouri, Ohio, with plans to expand to several more by the end of the year. The portfolio also includes Arnie’s, a topical wellness brand developed in partnership with Arnold Palmer Enterprises, which is available nationwide.

“Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” says Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm—they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.” For more information or to schedule an interview, please contact Bree DeVita at bree@themaverickpr.com or 303-513-1244.
