# VT Dry &amp; Cure Technologies, Inventors of Cannatrol, Recognized on Inc. 5000 2025 List of Fastest-Growing Private Companies

North Springfield, Vermont (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Aug 12, 2025 @ 11:20 AM Central — VT Dry & Cure Technologies, the parent company of Cannatrol, has been recognized on the 2025 Inc. 5000 list as one of the fastest-growing privately held companies in the United States. Earning the 5th position in manufacturing in its home state of Vermont, VT Dry ranked 1,498 on the annual list. The dry & cure global technology leader has experienced phenomenal growth driven by its proprietary patented Vaportrol® Technology that optimizes drying, curing and storage conditions for temperature and humidity sensitive goods, from cheese, meat, cannabis and other agricultural products in all seasons, climates and geographies.

“After years as a serial inventor and problem solver, I opened a Bed & Breakfast in Vermont. As I got to know the local cheesemakers in the state and learned of their desire to replicate ideal European aging environments, I knew I could use my expertise to perfect their process,” said David Sandelman, Chief Technology Officer and Chief Operating Officer of Cannatrol. “That idea evolved into a patented technology with applications far beyond cheese. We have since expanded into aged meats, cannabis and other agricultural products and the results speak for themselves. With new systems and upgrades in the pipeline, this is just the beginning.” While cultivation technology has evolved rapidly in cannabis and other sectors, post-harvest processing has remained largely stagnant, leaving cultivators and manufacturers to rely on outdated, inconsistent techniques. Cannatrol systems offer the only fully integrated, closed-loop drying, curing and storage solution available, delivering superior terpene retention, reduced mold risk and enhanced product yield.

For home growers, Cannatrol’s Cool Cure gives users complete control over post-harvest conditions, maximizing quality while reducing guesswork. For commercial operators, Cannatrol’s scalable systems offer year-round consistency and protection from seasonal climate variations. Both solutions are powered by Vaportrol®, first embraced by artisan cheesemakers and now used on farms and in facilities across the country.

The Inc. 5000 list is published annually by Inc. Magazine and ranks privately held U.S. companies based on percentage revenue growth over a three-year period. Past honorees include some of the world’s most iconic brands.
