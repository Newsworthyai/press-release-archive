A New Era of Woodstock Enthusiasts:The launch comes as younger generations are drinking less while showing increased interest in both cannabis products and functional beverages. Woodstock targets health-conscious consumers seeking better alternatives to alcohol - from working professionals and modern parents looking to decompress without hangovers, to creative individuals and music enthusiasts who value authentic experiences.

In addition to being "sober curious", many are "canna-curious" consumers who haven't used cannabis recently (or ever) but are open to exploring it as a functional alternative to alcohol. What unites Woodstock's customers is their desire for products that offer both social enjoyment and functional benefits - whether that's stress relief after a demanding day, creative inspiration for social gatherings, or natural sleep support - all while maintaining their commitment to healthier lifestyle choices.

“The original Woodstock brought people together around peace, love, music and plant-powered values that are driving today's wellness movement. Our beverages honor that legacy while creating new moments of connection for consumers who share those timeless ideals, whether they were there in '69 or are just discovering Woodstock today." — Richard Lee, CEO of Woodstock GoodsExpanding the MovementWoodstock THC Seltzers are available direct-to-consumer at woodstockgoods.co in over 30 states, as well as at specialty retailers and liquor stores across Illinois, Tennessee, New Jersey, Connecticut, Ohio, and Kansas/Missouri. The brand has plans to expand into additional states where hemp derived THC is legal later this year.

Festival Values for a New GenerationAs the anniversary of the festival approaches, Woodstock’s mission is to introduce the festival’s values to a new generation. The original festival's themes of community, consciousness, and positive change resonate with today's consumers seeking authentic connections and meaningful experiences.
