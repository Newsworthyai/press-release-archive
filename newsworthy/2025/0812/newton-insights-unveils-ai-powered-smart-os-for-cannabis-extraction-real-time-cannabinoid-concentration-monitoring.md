# Newton Insights Unveils AI-Powered Smart OS for Cannabis Extraction—Real-Time Cannabinoid Concentration Monitoring

New York (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Aug 12, 2025 @ 5:00 AM Eastern — The industry’s first AI-powered process-control platform for cannabis extraction delivers inline cannabinoid quantification, intelligent alerts, cost monitoring, and continuous optimization on every run—without workflow changes.

“Most cannabis operations are still running on spreadsheets and gut instincts. Our platform takes teams from making decisions in the dark to having clear visibility into what's happening in their facility. When operators can see real-time data on everything from environmental conditions to extraction efficiency, it completely changes how they approach their work,” added Kellan Finney, Co-Founder.Designed for hydrocarbon extraction (ethanol workflows coming soon), Newton’s Smart OS fills a critical gap by combining live sensor feeds, inline cannabinoid quantification, and AI-driven alerts. Operators can make science-backed adjustments mid-run—without changing workflows or waiting on lab results.

Immediate ROI — Proven Measurable GainsBuilt on a successful pilot with industry partners, the platform has already shown measurable results, including reducing idle time, which led to an extra extraction run per day — boosting revenue by over $4,000 daily for one early adopter. That’s six figures in potential annual gains.

Powered by Science — Built for Operators Anchored by precision optical sensors and a cannabis-trained LLM, Smart OS quantifies cannabinoids, tracks solvent ratios, and benchmarks live data in real time. In Q4, we'll extend visibility to chillers and other IoT devices with closed-loop alertsWant to see how it works in action? Request a demo or download the technical whitepaper for an in-depth look.

Key Capabilities

* Insight: Inline cannabinoid quantification
* Control: Real-time THC & solvent-ratio alerts to optimize yield
* Efficiency: Cost-per-gram analytics and waste prevention
* Compliance: Time-stamped logs for training, audits, and troubleshooting
