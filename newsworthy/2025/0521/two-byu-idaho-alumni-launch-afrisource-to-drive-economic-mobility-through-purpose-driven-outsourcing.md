# Two BYU–Idaho Alumni Launch Afrisource to Drive Economic Mobility Through Purpose-Driven Outsourcing

Dallas Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday May 21, 2025 @ 7:00 AM US/Central — Mac Agbonavbare and Marcelo Wilen are leveraging technology, grit, and purpose to connect high-performing African professionals with global businesses; redefining what opportunity looks like across borders.

In today’s remote-first economy, where sourcing top talent can often feel like navigating a maze of inflated costs and long-term contracts, one startup is offering a bold alternative. Afrisource, a nonprofit platform co-founded by two BYU–Idaho alumni, is reimagining outsourcing by combining access, affordability, and social impact.

Mac Agbonavbare, originally from Nigeria, and Marcelo Wilen, who grew up in Brazil, first met as international students at Brigham Young University–Idaho. Neither came from wealth. Both began their journeys as outsiders in the tech industry. Today, they are the co-founders of Afrisource - a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that connects global businesses with vetted, high-performing talent from across Africa.

Afrisource’s mission is to empower businesses worldwide to achieve more through quality outsourcing while unlocking the potential of Africa’s emerging talent

“Afrisource was never just about solving a hiring problem,” said Mac, who now serves as CEO. “It was about giving people like us - smart, hungry, and often overlooked - a shot at building lives of dignity through meaningful work.”Two Founders, One MissionMac began his career in tech with roles at Workday and Microsoft. He also co-founded a nonprofit aimed at supporting refugees with education and workforce training. Wilen, who once sold food in the streets of São Paulo to support his family, eventually worked his way into positions at Google, LinkedIn, and other top firms. He also launched a nonprofit aimed at helping college students gain access to economic and career opportunities.

“We’ve both been the underdog,” said Wilen. “We know what it feels like to be invisible, to be talented but overlooked. That’s the driving force behind Afrisource: flipping that narrative.”What Sets Afrisource ApartAfrisource is not another gig platform. It operates as a human-first outsourcing model focused on quality, trust, and mutual growth. The organization offers global companies access to flexible, high-impact professionals while reinvesting directly into the lives and futures of African talent.

Key Differentiators:

* Top-tier talent: Fully vetted (including background checks) professionals in operations, marketing, customer support, business administration, etc.

* Fully managed service: Afrisource handles hiring, onboarding, payroll, and compliance

* Impact-driven: A significant portion of resources is directed back to professionals and their communities

“I had no idea where to begin,” said Alexa K., founder and CEO of Wisdom Electric. “But after Afrisource helped me with SEO, I went from being invisible online to getting clients who found me through Google. It changed everything.”A New Playbook for OutsourcingAfrisource isn’t just solving a staffing problem - it’s introducing a smarter, more inclusive way for companies to source talent. With Africa’s vast pool of underleveraged professionals, the organization is bridging a critical gap in the global talent economy.

“The market is hungry for reliable, cost effective, values-driven talent,” Agbonavbare added. “Africa is full of it - brilliant professionals ready to deliver results. We’re not just building a business; we’re building a bridge between Africa and the rest of the world, between overlooked talent and the companies that need them, and between what outsourcing was and what it should be.”If early traction is any indication, that bridge is quickly becoming a superhighway.

Afrisource is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Those inspired to support its mission can do so in two ways:

Together, Afrisource and its partners are redefining the face of global work—and who gets to participate in it.
