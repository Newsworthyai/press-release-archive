# Lionheart Health Named as Top 40 Semi-Finalist in $101M XPRIZE Healthspan Competition

Newport Beach, California (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday May 21, 2025 @ 5:00 AM Pacific — Lionheart Health, Inc., an Orange County, California-based biotechnology company, has been named one of the 40 semi-finalists advancing in the $101M XPRIZE Healthspan Competition at the Longevity Investors Summit in New York City. The mission of XPRIZE is to inspire and empower humanity to achieve breakthroughs that accelerate an abundant and equitable future for all. Lionheart Health has been awarded $250,000 as part of the semi-finalist selection.

596 teams from 53 countries entered the competition. The winning team must demonstrate that their treatment restores muscle, cognitive, and immune function by a minimum of 10 years, with a goal of 20 years, in persons aged 50-80. The treatment must take 1 year or less.

Lionheart Health, Inc. has patented, developed, and is working to commercialize a technology platform that utilizes precise bioelectric signaling sequences to control release or regeneration-promoting proteins from tissues and cells. It has also developed bioelectrically enhanced biologics, including Klotho-expressing stem cells suspended in a proprietary nutrient hydrogel.

Recent studies by Abraham (2022)1 and Dubnov (2024)2 demonstrate that the Klotho protein plays a significant role in aging and longevity. It has been shown to extend lifespan and improve cognitive function in animal models, including mice and nonhuman primates. Research suggests that increasing Klotho levels through genetic manipulation, exercise, or other means may increase longevity and better overall health.

 “Our solution harnesses the body's natural healing processes to promote regeneration and renewal,” stated Dr. Leslie Miller, Lionheart Health's Chief Medical Officer."Lionheart Health demonstrated its ability to control regenerative protein expressions at its Research and Development Lab in Irvine, California at UCI Cove, in animal studies, and in over 300 patients in pilot clinical studies to earn a spot in the final 40," stated Dr. Jorge Genovese, Vice President of Bioelectric Regeneration Research. He and Lionheart Health founder Howard Leonhardt have been working as a team on bioelectric and stem cell-based regeneration research for more than 25 years to reach this milestone.

In the next phase, Lionheart Health must demonstrate its healthspan extension protocol in an IRB-approved and data safety monitoring board-supervised one-year clinical study with patient consent.

“Advancing as an XPRIZE Healthspan top 40 finalist is a proud moment for Lionheart Health and our entire team,” says Howard Leonhardt, Lead Inventor of the Lionheart Health technology platform and Founder, Executive Chairman, and co-CEO. “Our participation in XPRIZE has already been advantageous and has accelerated our path to commercialization. We look forward to this next step, which will allow us to demonstrate our technology in a well-designed clinical trial that we believe may lead to extending healthy aging for people worldwide.

Long-term Lionheart Health, Inc. is working in partnership with BioLeonhardt Whole Body and other partners to develop a whole-body regeneration chamber, a “womb for adults”, that combines AI, advanced robotics, stem cells, amniotic fluid, placenta, nutrient hydrogel and regeneration-promoting growth factors, all supported by patented bioelectrically controlled protein expressions, stem cell homing, proliferation and differentiation control.

Lionheart Health, Inc., via its subsidiary, Lionheart Longevity & Wellness, plans to open 124 MedSpa clinics over the next 60 months that specialize in the convergence of medical aesthetics and physician-directed healthspan longevity protocols. Locations in New York City and Newport Beach, CA are currently open. Licensed sites in San Diego, Santa Barbara, Phoenix and Mexico are going through training certification with plans to fully launch this summer.
