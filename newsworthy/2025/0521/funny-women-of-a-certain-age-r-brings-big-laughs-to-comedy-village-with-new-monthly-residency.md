# Funny Women of a Certain Age® Brings Big Laughs to Comedy Village with New Monthly Residency

New York, NY (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday May 21, 2025 @ 4:10 PM Eastern — Comedy Village Times Square is thrilled to announce that trailblazing comedian and producer Carole Montgomery is bringing her hit show, FUNNY WOMEN OF A CERTAIN AGE®, to the club for a brand-new monthly residency beginning May 21st at 352 West 44th Street (between Eighth and Ninth Avenues).

This isn't just another stand-up show—FUNNY WOMEN OF A CERTAIN AGE® is a no-holds-barred, laugh-out-loud night from comedy’s most fearless and experienced performers: women who have been there, done that, and are ready to tell you all about it.

Tickets are $20.00 with a two-item minimum. Visit comedyvillage.com for show dates and tickets, or call (347) 788-1781 for more information.

What started as a way for Carole to work with her friends has grown into a full-on comedy movement. A veteran of the stand-up world for more than 40 years, Carole remembers a time when two women on the same lineup was unthinkable. Now? Not enough has changed—which is exactly why FUNNY WOMEN OF A CERTAIN AGE was born.

Frustrated by how women “of a certain age” are overlooked and underestimated in the entertainment industry, Carole created this platform to push back—with punchlines. She’s battling ageism and sexism one joke at a time.

The show spotlights vibrant, whip-smart, and wickedly funny women—comedians who helped pave the way for generations of performers. Just don’t call them "over the hill." They've seen it all and they're still crushing it.

Over the years, FUNNY WOMEN OF A CERTAIN AGE® has featured an all-star lineup, including Fran Drescher, Luenell, Janeane Garofalo, Caroline Rhea, Marsha Warfield, Thea Vidale, Carol Leifer, Tammy Pescatelli, Julia Scotti, Wendy Liebman, and many more.

"Comedy Village is committed to showcasing voices that reflect the richness and diversity of human experience—and this show nails it," said Comedy Village owner PJ Landers. “Carole’s lineup is powerhouse-level talent, and we’re excited to bring their stories, insights, and killer timing to our stage.”

"I’m beyond excited to bring FUNNY WOMEN OF A CERTAIN AGE® to Comedy Village," said creator Carole Montgomery. “This club values authenticity, and this show is all about proving that funny doesn’t come with an expiration date.”
