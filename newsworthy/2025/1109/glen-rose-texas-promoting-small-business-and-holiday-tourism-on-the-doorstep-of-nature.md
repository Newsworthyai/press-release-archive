 Why should someone visit Glen Rose, Texas?

 Glen Rose, long known as the “Dinosaur Capital of Texas,” offers visitors a rare blend of small-town charm and natural wonder. With rolling limestone hills, clear rivers, and historic architecture surrounding a postcard-perfect courthouse square, the town embodies the warmth and beauty of rural Texas. “It’s a picturesque, Norman Rockwell-like town that feels a whole lot farther away than it is,” said Toler. “You don’t have to drive far to feel like you’ve truly escaped.”What happened recently in Glen Rose, Texas?

 This year, Glen Rose is celebrating a banner season following the success of the International Texas Longhorn Association’s 35th Annual Championship Show, which welcomed participants from 44 states and 15 countries. The event highlighted the town’s deep ties to Texas heritage — from its ranching roots to its role in preserving the legendary Longhorn breed.

 Does Glen Rose, Texas have any strong Christmas spirit?

 As the year draws to a close, Toler and his team are turning their attention to Christmas in Glen Rose, a cherished local tradition that transforms the historic square into a wonderland of light and community.
