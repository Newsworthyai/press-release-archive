# NuggMD Wants to Give Hundreds of Veterans Medical Marijuana Cards for Free

New York City (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Oct 29, 2025 @ 9:00 AM Eastern — In honor of Veterans Day, NuggMD, the leading international platform for medical cannabis evaluations, is offering free evaluations to all U.S. veterans.

 Last month, the company hit major growth milestones, expanding into Germany as well as two new U.S. states, increasing the number of prospective medical cannabis patients it can serve by nearly 20%. Now, NuggMD is doubling down on its annual effort to provide no-cost access to medical cannabis for past military service members. Their goal is to facilitate hundreds of free evaluations on Nov. 11 in partnership with like-minded organizations committed to helping those who have served.

 “U.S. military veterans are more likely than other Americans to suffer from PTSD and chronic pain. We can’t fix the systems that are responsible for that, but we can do our part to help by making it free for U.S. veterans to get medical cannabis evaluations through our platform on Veterans Day,” said Robert Brock, vice president of marketing at NuggMD. “Every veteran, and indeed every U.S. adult, deserves the freedom to legally use cannabis if they choose to.”

 The free evaluations will be offered to all veterans who reside in the 31 markets that NuggMD serves. The applicable states are listed on NuggMD’s website, and veterans can secure appointments using NuggMD’s on-demand platform from 8 AM to 10 PM in their local time zone.

 Since its launch in 2016, NuggMD's affiliated medical cannabis practitioners have helped over two million patients connect with qualified medical cannabis doctors.
