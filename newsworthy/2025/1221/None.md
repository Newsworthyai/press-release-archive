# The Alamo Rebuilt: Stewardship, Archaeology, and the Future of Downtown San Antonio

San Antonio, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Saturday Dec 20, 2025 @ 7:15 PM US/Central — In a new episode of The Building Texas Show, host Justin McKenzie sits down with Emily Baucum, communications leader at The Alamo, for an in-depth conversation on one of the most ambitious historic preservation projects underway in the United States.

 More than a symbol of a single battle, the Alamo is a 300-year-old site with global significance—designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site alongside San Antonio’s four Spanish colonial missions. Today, the people of Texas, through a $550 million public-private investment, are reimagining the Alamo as a world-class cultural campus that preserves history while expanding education, accessibility, and economic impact in downtown San Antonio.

 A Global Landmark with Texas Stewardship During the conversation, Baucum explains that the Alamo is owned by the people of Texas and managed by the State through the Texas General Land Office, with daily operations led by Alamo Trust, Inc. This structure allows the site to maintain both statewide accountability and on-the-ground stewardship.

 “People around the world plan travel around UNESCO World Heritage Sites,” Baucum noted. “For many international visitors, the Alamo isn’t just a Texas story—it’s an American story and a global story.”

 Visitors arrive from across Europe, Asia, and Australia, drawn by generations of cultural storytelling, education, and popular media that introduced the Alamo to audiences worldwide.

 The Three Pillars of the Alamo Plan Baucum outlines the three foundational pillars guiding the Alamo’s long-term vision:

 1. Preservation of the Alamo Church and Long Barrack — The last surviving structures from the mission era and the 1836 Battle of the Alamo, now treated as fragile historical artifacts.
2. Reclaiming the Historic Battlefield Footprint — Restoring the four-and-a-half-acre compound that once defined the Alamo before downtown commercial growth overtook the site in the late 19th century.
3. Building a World-Class Visitor Center and Museum — Set to open in late 2027, featuring eight galleries that tell the full 300-year story of Texas history.

 This vision reframes the Alamo not as a single building, but as a complete historical landscape shaped by Indigenous peoples, Spanish colonists, Mexican history, the Texas Revolution, and modern preservation efforts.

 History Still Being Discovered One of the most compelling aspects of the episode is the discussion of ongoing archaeology at the Alamo. Baucum emphasizes that history is not static—new discoveries continue to shape how the site is preserved and interpreted.

 Recent excavations uncovered more than 250,000 artifacts near the Long Barrack alone, including musket balls, weapon fragments, and Spanish mission-era flooring. These findings directly influence construction plans and deepen understanding of daily life at the site across centuries.

 “For many visitors, this is the only place they’ll ever see active archaeologists at work,” Baucum shared. “It brings history to life, especially for kids.”

 A New Gateway to Downtown San Antonio The episode also highlights the transformation of Alamo Plaza into a walkable, educational public space. Recent additions include:

 * Mission Gate & Lunette, an artistic interpretation of the Alamo’s southern fortifications
* Plaza de Valero, a $20 million community park and performance space
* The Promenade, converting former vehicle streets into pedestrian pathways with interpretive panels and public art

 These improvements redefine how visitors arrive at and experience the Alamo, encouraging longer stays and deeper engagement.

 Later this spring, the Paseo del Alamo will reopen, reconnecting the Alamo with the San Antonio River Walk—linking the state’s most visited destination with one of the city’s most iconic attractions.

 Education at the Core Education remains central to the Alamo’s mission. The Ralston Family Collection Center, opened in 2023, currently displays more than 500 artifacts—many never before seen by the public. In 2025, the Texas Cavaliers Education Center will open, providing dedicated space for student learning and field trips.

 The forthcoming Visitor Center and Museum will expand this impact, featuring immersive exhibits and an event space capable of hosting up to 700 people, with panoramic views of the San Antonio skyline and the Alamo Church.

 Building the Future While Preserving the Past As downtown San Antonio undergoes significant growth—including new sports, convention, and cultural investments—the Alamo remains a stabilizing anchor. The episode positions the site as both a cultural cornerstone and an economic catalyst, supporting tourism, education, and civic pride.

 “The Alamo represents many cultures, many chapters, and many lessons,” McKenzie noted during the conversation. “Preserving it well means making it accessible, inclusive, and meaningful for future generations.”
