# TAY Investments Acquires 365-Unit Development Site in Jersey City's Rapidly Transforming West Side Corridor

Jersey City, NJ (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Dec 2, 2025 @ 4:00 PM UTC — TAY Investments, a vertically integrated real estate development company specializing in multifamily properties, announced today the acquisition of a fully approved development site at 212-230 Culver Avenue in Jersey City's West Side neighborhood. The 56,897-square-foot site will accommodate an 8-story building with 365 residential units, approximately 1,500 square feet of ground floor commercial space, and 184 indoor garage parking spaces, marking TAY's largest development project to date.

 "The acquisition of 212 Culver Ave. represents a major step forward for TAY Investments as we continue expanding our footprint in the City, and we're incredibly excited about it," said Yuval Shram, Founder and CEO of TAY Investments. "This investment reinforces our long-term belief in Jersey City's, and specifically in the West Side, tremendous growth potential."

 TAY Investments has been active in Jersey City since 2013 and currently operates six projects in the city, including two under development, totaling over 800 residential units and 22,000 square feet of ground floor commercial space.

 The property is strategically located along Route 440, an area undergoing a multi-billion dollar transformation fueled by three massive, long-term anchors: the 100-acre Bayfront waterfront redevelopment, the SciTech Scity innovation hub, and the expanding New Jersey City University campus. The site sits just 0.3 miles from the West Side Avenue Hudson-Bergen Light Rail Station, providing direct access to downtown Jersey City and Manhattan.

 "The West Side area of Jersey City offers a unique combination of connectivity, community energy, and long-term value creation," Shram added. "For TAY Investments, this marks another strategic milestone in delivering high-quality, community-driven multifamily housing and we're committed to delivering a thoughtful, sustainable development that elevates the neighborhood and delivers meaningful impact for both our residents and the community."

 The development will feature "The Sanctuary," a highly amenitized wellness area with indoor and outdoor facilities including a pool, hot tub, state-of-the-art gym, yoga and meditation center, dry and wet saunas, cold plunge, pickleball court, rooftop bar, and more. The entire building will be integrated with state-of-the-art technology features to elevate the resident experience.

 Construction is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2026, with a grand opening targeted for summer 2028. The project will feature a mix of studio, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom configurations totaling 312,915 gross square feet.

 "With interest rates beginning to move toward normalization and construction cost escalation moderating, we believe there will be even stronger demand for high-end modern apartments in strong growth areas like Jersey City," Shram noted.

 Shram acknowledged the TAY team and key partners: "I would like to thank all of the TAY team, who I could not do this without. It is an honor and a privilege to work with each and every one of you. Special thanks to our partners at BHI - Ilana Druyan and David Kesselman - who have always been there for us. Listing agent Yanni Marmarou was instrumental in closing this transaction. He negotiated optimal pricing and terms, landing us what is likely the standout deal of the 2024–2025 cycle in Jersey City."
