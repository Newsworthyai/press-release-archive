# SalesNexus Announces New Partner Program: 50% Recurring Commissions for Life

Houston, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Dec 2, 2025 @ 8:00 AM Central — For over 20 years, SalesNexus has helped sales teams build stronger pipelines, automate outreach, and retain customers an average of 4+ years. With the launch of this program, SalesNexus is inviting partners to join a growth engine that values long-term relationships and shared success.

 Program Highlights * 50% commission on all subscription payments—forever: Partners earn half of every subscription payment their referred customer makes, including renewals and upgrades. (SalesNexus)
* Free unlimited partner account: Partners receive a free SalesNexus subscription for life—no cost to join. (SalesNexus)
* High customer lifetime value: With an average customer staying 5+ years, partners can build a consistent, recurring revenue stream. (SalesNexus)
* Unlimited referrals, no cap: There is no limit on the number of customers a partner can refer or the commissions they can earn. (SalesNexus)
* Fast approval and onboarding: Partners get instant access to referral links, exclusive offers, marketing assets and weekly onboarding sessions. (SalesNexus)

 Why This Program Stands Out “In business, the best relationships are built on trust and alignment,” said Craig Klein, CEO of SalesNexus. "Customers typically stay with SalesNexus for more than 5 years. Our new partner program maximizes earnings for partners and affiliates by sharing fees for the life of the subscription."

 The structure is built to align with SalesNexus’ philosophy of mutual success. Customers benefit by gaining access to a proven platform backed by two decades of innovation; partners benefit by tapping into meaningful recurring revenue streams built on sustainable customer retention.

 How to Get Started Becoming a SalesNexus Partner is simple:

 1. Sign up—get instant approval and your unique referral link.
2. Promote—share with your network of B2B sales teams who use CRM and marketing automation.
3. Earn—you get paid as each referred customer pays, including renewals and upgrades. (SalesNexus)
