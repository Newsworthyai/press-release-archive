# BoosterHub Launches Print-on-Demand Merchandise Platform to Empower School Booster Clubs

Austin, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Feb 19, 2025 @ 11:50 AM Central — BoosterHub Launches Print-on-Demand Merchandise Platform to Empower School Booster Clubs

AUSTIN, TX - BoosterHub, the leading management software app serving more than 500 school booster clubs nationwide, today announced the launch of BoosterHub Merch, an integrated print-on-demand merchandise solution designed to streamline fundraising and eliminate inventory management for volunteer-led organizations.

BoosterHub Merch addresses one of the most significant challenges facing booster club volunteers: managing and storing spirit wear inventory, where unsold merchandise often negates the fundraising potential of spirit wear sales. The new platform enables clubs supporting sports teams, marching bands, and other school activities to offer branded merchandise without the burden of upfront costs, storage requirements, or unsold inventory risks.

"Our mission has always been to maximize the impact of volunteers who support education and youth activities," said Robin Eissler, CEO of BoosterHub. "It's time to get rid of the storage closet and let technology handle the logistics of merchandise sales, so our volunteers can focus on what matters most – supporting students and programs."

The platform, which is now available to all BoosterHub subscribers, integrates seamlessly with existing BoosterHub features that helped member organizations raise nearly $15 million in dues, memberships, and fundraising last year. Currently serving more than 50,000 booster club members, BoosterHub continues to innovate in support of volunteer-led organizations.

BoosterHub Merch features include:

* Zero-inventory model eliminating upfront costs and storage needs
* Simple design tool for creating custom spirit wear
* One-click "Add to Store" capability for instant product deployment
* Automated order fulfillment and shipping
* Customizable online stores operating 24/7
* Optimized pricing for maximum fundraising impact

This launch represents another step in BoosterHub's commitment to modernizing booster club operations and maximizing the efficiency of volunteer-led organizations.

About BoosterHub BoosterHub is the leading management platform for school booster clubs, providing comprehensive tools for membership management, fundraising, and volunteer coordination. Serving more than 500 booster clubs and 50,000 members nationwide, BoosterHub's mission is to maximize the impact of volunteers who support education and youth activities.
