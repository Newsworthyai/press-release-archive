# Cork Supply’s AI driven and Patented X100 Technology Gains International Recognition

Benicia, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Feb 19, 2025 @ 7:00 AM US/Pacific — * The company invested 1.2 million Euro in innovative and patented technology that analyzes 100% of the closures to eliminate anomalous cases of oxygen ingress, providing the most consistent performance cork closures on the market.
* The Legacy closure is the culmination of over a decade of investments in the search for the perfect closure and the only one in the world which guarantees returned bottle buy back.
* Cork Supply has invested 11 million Euro in cork closure innovation over the past decade.
* The X100 patented technology has been awarded with multiple innovation awards and certifications since it’s launch in 2024: at the tradeshows SIMEI in Milan, Vinitech in Bordeaux, SIVAL in France 2025 and latest ENOMAQ in Spain.

Cork Supply, a global company specializing in natural and technical closures for still and sparkling wines, launched the groundbreaking X100 technology in January 2024.

The patented technology that is powered by AI, maps the internal structure of a natural cork with an electromagnetic scanner, then feeds the scan into AI-powered software that correlates the image with the projected oxygen ingress.

Using machine learning and big data, the X100’s algorithm draws on 12+ years of data seta to identify anomalous corks that would allow more than 10x the desired oxygen ingress.

Cork Supply is the first company in the industry to have developed this incredible solution for a long-term concern of winemakers: consistent OTR rates on natural corks.

The Legacy natural cork is the result of several Cork Supply innovations bundled together, including the new and patented X100 technology, the DS100 sensory guarantee and the DS100+ automatic TCA detection technology.

Legacy provides premium wines with the ultimate safeguard in terms of consistency, both structural and sensory wise.

“We've been obsessed with the perfect cork closure since we launched Cork Supply in the 1980s. We have always invested in technologies, creating patents and solutions that allow us to reach the premium market today with the natural cork closure closer to perfection in the market,” says Jochen Michalski, president and founder of Cork Supply."The new technology is the pinnacle of a decade of research and raises the status of the natural cork closure and the position of Cork Supply as an innovation leader in this field," he adds.The X100 technology and Legacy closure were unveiled January 2024 at the Unified Wine and Grape Symposium, an industry event taking place in Sacramento, California.
