# Nova Scotia District Mired in Conflicts of Interest Over Aquaculture Expansion

Argyle, Nova Scotia, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Apr 9, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Central — The Municipality for the District of Argyle in Nova Scotia is facing a controversy regarding conflicts of interest surrounding the expansion of aquaculture facilities near residential properties. Concerns have been raised about the process through which aquaculture locations were selected, with allegations of favoritism and lack of transparency. The district is currently mired in growing conflicts of interest as stakeholders question the integrity of the decision-making process. Despite calls for accountability and oversight, the municipality has ignored these concerns, further exacerbating the tensions within the community.

Residents in the affected area are expressing frustration and anxiety over the potential impacts of aquaculture expansion on their quality of life and property values. The lack of proper consultation and meaningful engagement with the community has fueled the discontent among residents and heightened suspicions of impropriety. As the situation unfolds, the district finds itself at a crossroads, facing pressure to address the conflicts of interest and restore trust in its governance processes. Efforts to promote transparency, address community concerns, and uphold ethical practices will be crucial in navigating this complex and challenging issue.

ADA locations rigged in Argyle residential areas, creating conflict; public consultation lacking, evidence and conflicts exposed.Argyle residents have obtained evidence through Freedom of Information requests that demonstrates local oyster farmers and municipal staff fixed and rigged desired aquaculture locations in residential areas to the growing concern and disdain of Argyle constituents. The N.S. Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture (DFA) has in turn based their application and approval process on the local bid rigging of these locations. Further, no adequate public consultation has been performed to date on ADA locations. (announced by MoDA Council June 2024 session).

The Evidence

1. FOIPOP releases are available on the Argyle Municipality website at this link.
2. Evidence of Conflicts of Interest are available at this link. (6 presentations).

MoDA and DFA defend conflicts, refuse resolutions; block FOI requests; ignore constituents' calls, emails.

The municipality for the District of Argyle (MoDA) and DFA continue to refuse public requests to resolve conflicts of interest and redo public consultation on ADA locations. Frustrated constituents attended a March 20, 2025 council session demanding Council to investigate numerous conflicts of interest and asked council to perform adequate public consultations.

Instead, council refused to allow concerned residents an opportunity to present before a motion was tabled, then introduced a letter from Minister Kent Smith of DFA who praised MoDA for its efforts to date. Council then invited DFA program representative Bruce Hancock to provide rebuttals for all public concerns without debate. A point of order was introduced in session to encourage Warden Albright to recuse herself from the discussion citing family conflicts who work for a local applicant. The same applicant is also conflicted in rigging the process to their advantage. Warden Albright refused to recuse herself, declaring no conflict.

Within days of the council session, MoDA began setting arbitrary and exorbitant fees to discourage constituents from seeking freedom of information. In addition, MoDA has adopted Bill 1 passed by the NS government that now allows a municipality to declare any undesired requests as trivial, frivolous, or vexatious.

At the guidance of the Warden and CAO, Council has now taken a posture to ignore any emails or calls on the subject of ADA and has not acknowledged or responded further to constituents. Constituents have presented a formal complaint and asked council to initiate an inquiry into the Conflicts of Interest under section 12 of the Municipal Conflict of Interest Act. Former Liberal Candidate for MLA Argyle, Lorelei Murphy says, "Seeing local councilors refuse to represent and listen to their constituents is extremely alarming. These councilors and wardens have been given the trust of their residents when they were elected that they would behave and legislate openly and in good faith. Given the volume of concerns and perceived evidence presented by the residents throughout the area, I think it is council's obligation to hold an open and unbiased review of their decisions to this point and act accordingly moving forward."

Argyle resident Chris Thibedeau highlights, “It’s clear now that the farmers cheated. And the email evidence shows select individuals in MoDA helped them. These are no longer perceived conflicts. The evidence shows real and direct conflicts exist and they need to be investigated. It’s disheartening to see our council act in such a non-transparent, unfair, and biased manner”.Argyle resident Corey Clamp further adds, “My communications with my councilor have not been disrespectful, nor have they been argumentative, yet weeks later and still I have received nothing. I expect a fulsome response soon but if no response is forthcoming, I’ve asked my councilor to at least have the courtesy to respond and let me know why. People are watching. He should act the part and have the courtesy and good sense to reply to his constituents, or step down, because continued silence clearly demonstrates an inability (or worse, lack of interest) in being an effective councilor for his district's residents.”About the ARA

The Association for Responsible Aquaculture (ARA) in Argyle is a community stakeholder group of over 300 residents concerned with the lack of transparency and fairness offered by the Aquaculture Development Area (ADA) Pilot led by the Municipality of Argyle and the NS Dept. of Fisheries and Aquaculture. While the ADA is a government led effort, the ARA represents the public and residents of Lobster Bay who seek fairness and a balance of realizing aquaculture expansion in non residential areas in a manner that promotes Tourism and the local harvesting of seafood. ARA is not anti-aquaculture. The goal is to make sure the ADA achieves balance and offers a win for all stakeholders including industry and the public. https://www.facebook.com/associationforresponsibleaquaculture
