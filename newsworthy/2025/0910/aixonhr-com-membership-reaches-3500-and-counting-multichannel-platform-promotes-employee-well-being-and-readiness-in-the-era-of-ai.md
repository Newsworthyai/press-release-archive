# AIXonHR.com Membership Reaches 3,500 and Counting; Multichannel Platform Promotes Employee Well-being and Readiness in the Era of AI

South Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Sep 10, 2025 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — Developed in partnership with HR.com, AIX enables experts, leaders, and HR peers to share insights and seek support on cultivating mentally resilient, emotionally intelligent, and professionally adaptable workforces in an AI-augmented world. AIX’s more than 3,500 opt-in members include HR professionals with small- and medium-sized businesses, governmental agencies and institutions, as well as senior HR and business leaders from some of the world’s most recognizable companies.

“AIX’s growth indicates a recognition that fostering employee well-being and readiness is essential as AI rapidly spreads across organizations, improving processes but also increasing instability, uncertainty, confusion, and anxiety,” said AIX co-founder and Managing Director, Charles Epstein. “Having 3,500 opt-in members indicates that more HR professionals are seeking insights and direction on creating resilient, adaptable, and human-centered workforces. Our work is only beginning, but this is a very encouraging start.” AIX’s core components include AIXonHR.com (a “foundational” HR.com community), the AIX Factor podcast (conversations with business leaders, behavioral scientists, technologists, and wellness experts that probe the real-world effects of AI on people and work culture), and the AIX Files weekly Substack newsletter (news, perspectives, and predictions on the impacts of AI on well-being, readiness, and performance).
