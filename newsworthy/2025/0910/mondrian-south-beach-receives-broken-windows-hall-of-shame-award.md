# Mondrian South Beach Receives “Broken Windows – Hall of Shame Award”

Los Angeles, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Sep 10, 2025 @ 9:00 AM US/Pacific — The luxury Mondrian Hotel in South Beach, Florida, has been singled out for a stinging “Broken Windows – Hall of Shame Award” for what best-selling author and customer service expert Michael Levine calls “a shocking dereliction of duty to its paying guests.”

Levine, author of 19 books on customer service and business excellence – including five bestsellers and the widely regarded Broken Windows, Broken Business (www.BrokenWindowsBook.com) – described his recent stay as “a descent into chaos and disgraceful corporate shortsightedness.”

Initially, Levine’s experience was favorable: a warm welcome, a beautiful bay-view room, and a pleasant dinner. But by Sunday afternoon, the atmosphere had devolved into what he described as “a spring break – rap party free-for-all,” caused by the hotel’s policy of selling tickets to non-hotel guests for rowdy weekend pool parties.

“A flood of intoxicated partygoers, loud and vulgar, overran the pool area, making it inhospitable for families and those seeking a refined experience,” Levine said. “By late afternoon, staff members were privately expressing concern for their safety.”When his cruise was unexpectedly canceled, Levine was forced to stay two more nights. Monday night proved even worse, with “guests” cramming six or more people into rooms, shouting and fighting into the early hours. Despite repeated calls to security, he was told such disturbances are “regular occurrences” tied to the hotel’s pool-party policy.

Levine’s post-stay research found his experience far from unique:

* TripAdvisor: “Very noisy, dirty and poorly frequented… shouting guests on balconies at all hours.”
* Agoda: “Pool overrun with weekend party scene guests… more club than hotel.”
* Luxury Link: Reports of marijuana use by the pool from morning to evening with no staff intervention.

“The Mondrian name, once a symbol of modern elegance, has been reduced to a sad caricature of reckless profit-seeking at the expense of guest dignity and safety,” Levine said.The “Broken Windows – Hall of Shame Award” is reserved for businesses that, in Levine’s view, have allowed minor lapses to snowball into systemic failures that destroy customer trust.

“I strongly urge the Mondrian to rethink these destructive policies. Close your eyes and imagine you and your family in the middle of this chaos. That’s not hospitality – it’s an insult.”
