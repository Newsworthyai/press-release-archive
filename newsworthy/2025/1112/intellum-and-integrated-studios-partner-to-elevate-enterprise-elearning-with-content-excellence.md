 Integrated brings nearly a decade of experience crafting high‑impact eLearning programs, content migrations, graphic design, and storytelling for enterprise clients. Their focus on aligning brand, learner needs, and behavioral goals complements Intellum’s mission to turn learning into growth through scalable delivery.
