# Zooby Launches the Best Residential Paint Warranty in Texas

San Antonio, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Aug 22, 2025 @ 10:00 AM Central — Zooby Neighborhood Superheroes Inc., San Antonio’s trusted premium home service company, now offers the most comprehensive residential paint warranty in Texas. Every interior and exterior painting project is backed by a 5-year warranty that covers labor and materials, more than double the industry standard.

Homeowners searching for reliable house painters in San Antonio with a warranty will find that the Zooby program goes beyond promises. While most Texas paint warranties last only 1–3 years and often exclude materials, Zooby’s 5-year guarantee includes complete coverage for peeling, blistering, or chipping caused by workmanship.

“Our warranty isn’t a marketing gimmick—it’s a promise backed by our process,” said Elmer Zubiate, CEO of Zooby Neighborhood Superheroes Inc. “We use scientific measurements, multiple inspection points, and only premium paints to ensure lasting results. That’s why we can guarantee the work longer than anyone else in Texas.”

Why Zooby’s 5-Year Paint Warranty Stands Out:* Most extended Warranty in Texas – 5 years of protection for your home’s paint finish.
* Labor & Materials Included – No hidden fees or exclusions for materials.
* Covers Interior and Exterior Painting – From living rooms to complete home exteriors.
* Quality You Can See – Multi-step prep, premium paints, and strict quality checks.

Zooby’s premium flat-rate model means every paint job includes both labor and materials in one no-surprise price. The company also offers a full range of home improvement services, from wonderful space upgrades to handyman repairs, all backed by warranties that outperform the competition.
