Oakland, California (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Aug 22, 2025 @ 9:00 AM Pacific â€” The Peralta Colleges Foundation, a beacon of support for students in need across the Peralta Colleges - Berkeley City College, College of Alameda, Laney College, and Merritt College - is excited to announce the upcoming 2025 Dr. William "Bill" Riley "Swing For Student Success" Golf Tournament. Since its inception in 1971, the foundation has been dedicated to providing scholarships and financial aid to help students achieve their academic and career aspirations.

"Hosting this year's golf tournament enables the foundation to support the intellectual, cultural and educational needs of our students, faculty, and staff throughout the Peralta Colleges. Funds raised at the tournament help elevate students from poverty, train the unemployed and underemployed, and prepare students to successfully transition to four-year universities," said Dr. William "Bill" Riley, a proud member of the foundation's board.

The tournament, set to take place on Monday, September 8, 2025, at the picturesque Sequoyah Country Club in Oakland, offers a unique opportunity for businesses and individuals to contribute to the success of students in the Peralta Colleges. By becoming a sponsor, participants will play a crucial role in transforming the lives of deserving students and helping them reach their full potential.

Businesses and organizations are encouraged to showcase their community spirit by sponsoring this event and supporting the foundation's vital work in empowering students to achieve their educational goals.
