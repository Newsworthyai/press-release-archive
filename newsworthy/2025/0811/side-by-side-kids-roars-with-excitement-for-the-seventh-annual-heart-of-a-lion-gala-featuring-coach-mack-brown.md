# Side by Side Kids Roars with Excitement for the Seventh Annual Heart of a Lion Gala Featuring Coach Mack Brown

Austin, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Aug 11, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Central â€” Side by Side Kids is proud to announce the upcoming Heart of a Lion Gala, its premier fundraising event that aims to uplift and support under-resourced youth in Austin. The event, now in its seventh year, will bring together supporters of the organization for an unforgettable evening of inspiration and generosity.

Side by Side Kids (SBSK) is dedicated to inspiring and equipping children in the Austin area to excel academically, make wise choices, and nurture their faith. Serving Pre-K through fifth-grade students in economically disadvantaged areas, SBSK provides vital after-school academic support and spiritual development programs.

Heart of a Lion has become a cornerstone event for Side by Side Kids and their ongoing efforts. This year, the gala will feature Legendary College Football Coach Mack Brown as the keynote speaker, promising an evening filled with motivation and purpose.

The event will feature an engaging live auction led by Cowboy Auctioneer, offering attendees the chance to contribute directly to SBSK's mission of empowering more students in need. The funds raised during the auction and Fund a Need segment will go directly towards providing crucial resources and support to the children who need it most.

"We're motivated by the impactful work being done by Side by Side Kids to support students' educational and spiritual journeys. The Heart of a Lion Gala is an opportunity for us to come together and make a difference in the lives of Austin's youth," said Seth Hale, Cowboy Auctioneer.

By fostering a nurturing environment that encourages growth and self-belief, Side by Side Kids enables children to unlock their full potential. Events like the Heart of a Lion Gala play a crucial role in the organization's continued commitment to supporting the educational and spiritual development of Austin's young learners.
