# ORGANA International Celebrates 30 Years of Customer Loyalty and Prepares for Wider U.S. Distribution

Springville, UT (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Oct 3, 2025 @ 7:00 AM US/Mountain — ORGANA International, a pioneer in natural mineral-based wellness products since 1997, is celebrating its 30th year in business with a growing base of loyal customers and a continued 5-star rating from the Better Business Bureau. With thousands of repeat buyers nationwide and products already available on Amazon, the company is now preparing for the next phase of its U.S. distribution expansion.

Founded nearly three decades ago, ORGANA International began with the vision of Sam Curtis, who developed a unique method to filter decomposed plant matter rich in 76 trace minerals and fulvic acid—nutrients essential to human health. After Curtis’ passing in 2012, longtime industry veteran Larry Mills acquired the company, expanded its product line, and strengthened its customer-first mission.

“Reaching nearly 30 years in business is not about how long we’ve been around—it’s about the people who continue to trust and use our products year after year,” said Mills, CEO of ORGANA International. “From families and athletes to seniors and everyday health-conscious consumers, our loyal customers are the reason we’re here. Their support motivates us to make ORGANA available to even more people across the country.”Nearly Three Decades of Natural WellnessORGANA’s flagship product, the multi-mineral drink, provides a convenient way to replenish the body’s essential nutrients in one daily serving. The product line has grown to include flavored mineral beverages (cherry, wildberry pomegranate, peach mango), magnesium cream for muscle support, liquid oxygen supplements, silver-based immune support, and Essiac tea for detoxification. All products are formulated with pharmaceutical-grade water and natural ingredients, ensuring bioavailability and safety.

Unlike many synthetic supplements, ORGANA products are naturally derived and tested under a microscope for Brownian movement—a sign the particles are still “alive” and active. With a particle size of just 20 nanometers, the minerals can pass through the skin barrier and down to the cellular level, allowing the body to easily absorb what it needs—and safely excrete what it doesn’t.

Built on Customer TrustORGANA has proudly maintained a 5-star BBB rating while upholding its long-standing philosophy: “The customer is always right.” Every product is backed by a satisfaction guarantee, and customer feedback continues to fuel the company’s growth.

“Success to us isn’t just measured in numbers,” Mills added. “It’s when a customer tells us their energy is better, their recovery is faster, or their health has improved. That’s what keeps us moving forward.”Looking AheadAs it celebrates its 30th year, ORGANA International is preparing for the next phase of growth, with broader distribution channels on the horizon. The company’s mission remains the same: to deliver natural, bioavailable products that help people live healthier lives.
