# Mitch Gould of Nutritional Products International Recalls Visit to Walmart Headquarters

Boca Raton, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Oct 8, 2025 @ 9:00 AM US/Eastern — Mitch Gould, founder and CEO of Nutritional Products International (NPI), vividly recalls the day he visited Walmart headquarters—calling it one of the defining moments of his career. For Gould, who has spent decades helping global brands enter and expand in the U.S. retail market, walking into Bentonville represented the pinnacle of retail achievement.

“To me, walking into the headquarters of Walmart in Bentonville was like walking onto the field to play the Super Bowl,” said Gould. “It’s the biggest stage there is—founded by Sam Walton, built by grit, vision, and sheer execution. When you’re there, you feel the scale of what it means to move product, shape consumer trends, and truly go national.”

Gould’s visit came during the rollout of Steven Seagal’s Lightning Bolt Energy Drink, a project that epitomized NPI’s ability to move quickly from concept to shelf. Working with Seagal—a world-renowned actor, martial artist, and master herbologist—Gould developed an all-natural energy drink infused with Tibetan goji berries, Asian cordyceps, and B vitamins. He assembled a world-class beverage team, designed the packaging, and managed the launch strategy that landed Lightning Bolt in 3,500 Walmart Supercenters, along with major distribution through 7-Eleven and Amazon.

“The meeting in Bentonville was unforgettable,” Gould added. “We were there to present a product backed by one of the biggest action stars on the planet, and Walmart recognized the scale of that opportunity immediately. When we struck the deal, it wasn’t just about getting on the shelf—it was about making history.”Behind the scenes, Gould’s wife Sherry coordinated the complex logistics that achieved a 99% Walmart fill rate, ensuring Lightning Bolt consistently met the retailer’s strict performance standards. “Walmart grades you on execution,” said Gould. “You don’t just make the sale—you have to deliver flawlessly. Sherry made sure we did.”

But Gould’s Walmart journey didn’t end there. On a later trip to Bentonville, he returned with Steven Seagal to meet with Walmart’s international beverage division. Gould in his crisp navy-blue suit and Seagal in a burgundy Nehru jacket made an unforgettable impression—and the meeting resulted in approval to expand Lightning Bolt into Walmart’s Asian and Central American markets.

“That second visit showed just how far we’d come,” Gould said. “From concept to international expansion through the world’s largest retailer—it proved that anything is possible when you combine vision, persistence, and execution.”The success of Lightning Bolt became one of many landmark moments in Gould’s storied career.
