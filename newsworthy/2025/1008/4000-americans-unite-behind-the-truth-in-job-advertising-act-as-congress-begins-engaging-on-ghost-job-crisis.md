# 4,000 Americans Unite Behind the Truth in Job Advertising Act as Congress Begins Engaging on “Ghost Job” Crisis

Washington, D.C. (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Oct 8, 2025 @ 4:00 AM US/Eastern — More than 4,000 Americans have now signed the petition supporting the Truth in Job Advertising and Accountability Act (TJAAA), a citizen-driven initiative demanding transparency and honesty in employment postings. The rapid growth underscores a national call to end the spread of so-called “ghost jobs”—positions advertised with no intent to hire.

In the past week alone, the TJAAA Working Group has met with staff from the offices of Senator James Lankford (OK) and Representatives Nikema Williams (GA), Eugene Vindman (VA), Brad Sherman (CA), Terri Sewell (AL), Pablo José Hernández (PR), Beth Van Duyne (TX), Troy Downing (MT), Monica De La Cruz (TX), Henry Cuellar (TX), and Tim Burchett (TN). These discussions follow earlier conversations with Senator Ruben Gallego (AZ), Senator Jack Reed (RI), and Representatives Debbie Dingell (MI), Troy Carter (LA), Gwen Moore (WI), Maxwell Frost (FL), Roger Williams (TX), Alma Adams (NC), and Keith Self (TX).

 “Every signature represents someone who was ghosted, misled, or ignored in their job search,” said Eric K. Thompson, founder of the TJAAA Working Group. “Congress is starting to listen—not because of lobbyists, but because thousands of ordinary Americans are standing together to demand truth in hiring.” The TJAAA proposes common-sense measures to ensure job postings reflect genuine openings, prevent misuse of applicant data, and hold employers accountable for transparency in the hiring process. Supporters argue that deceptive listings inflate job-market statistics and waste millions of hours of unpaid applicant labor each year.

Advocates encourage constituents of the listed legislators to reach out and voice support. The petition, hosted at change.org/StopGhostJobs, continues to gain momentum as workers, job seekers, and business leaders call for reform.

About the TJAAA Working Group The Truth in Job Advertising and Accountability Act (TJAAA) Working Group is a non-partisan coalition of volunteers, policy experts, and industry professionals committed to restoring honesty and accountability in the hiring process.
