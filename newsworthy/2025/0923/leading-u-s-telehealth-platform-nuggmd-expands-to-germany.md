# Leading U.S. Telehealth Platform NuggMD Expands to Germany

Berlin, Germany (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Sep 23, 2025 @ 9:00 AM Eastern — NuggMD, the leading platform U.S. patients turn to for access to medical cannabis evaluations, today announced that it is now serving patients in Germany at https://nuggmd.de, marking the California-based company's first expansion into an international market and the first time a U.S.-based cannabis telehealth platform has expanded across borders.

NuggMD has a 10-year track record of serving patients in the United States, where cannabis is criminalised at the federal level but legal, to varying degrees, in many states. This contradiction impedes access for many patients who would otherwise stand to benefit.

Germany, by contrast, has taken a centralized approach to regulating medical cannabis access, which has quickly proven to be effective. According to a recent survey of more than 11,000 German cannabis consumers, nearly 90% of them get their cannabis from legal sources, and there is a near-universal preference to consume on personal property as opposed to in public spaces.

This data provides evidence that the country’s patient-centric approach is working for the stakeholders involved. That approach allows patients to purchase cannabis right away if the medical determination is affirmative, which provides a better patient experience.

“Operating as successfully as we have, for as long as we have, in the United States has given us the perspective and the institutional knowledge necessary to effectively operate in any medical cannabis market. We’re happy to be active in Germany and to be looking at other markets to expand into as well,” said Charlie Russell, CEO of NuggMD.“Cannabis markets in the EU area are poised to grow rapidly, in large part because the policy approach is appropriate. Our expansion to Germany reflects our mission of helping as many people as possible have fast, reliable access to plant-based medicine where it’s legal. Everybody should have the freedom to make informed decisions about their own wellness options under the guidance of a doctor.”About NuggMDNuggMD is the leading international medical marijuana technology platform, serving patients in 31 state-legal U.S. markets and in Germany.

Since the company’s founding in 2015, it has connected more than 2m patients with medical marijuana doctors via a state-of-the-art telehealth platform. The company believes every human being has the right to explore the potential benefits of medical cannabis and is fully committed to helping each patient explore every option in their journey to wellness.
