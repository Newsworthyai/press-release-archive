Detroit, MI (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Aug 20, 2025 @ 10:06 AM Central — Today, IgniteIt Inc. (IgniteIt) announced that the cannabis industry’s premier business conference and media platform, formerly operated by Benzinga Cannabis, is entering a new chapter, separate and not affiliated with Benzinga.

“Fifteen years ago, I started Benzinga with a mission to empower investors with better information,” said Jason Raznick, Chairman of IgniteIt. “Now, with IgniteIt, I’m thrilled to help build something new again — this time with a laser focus on emerging industries like cannabis. We’ve assembled a team that knows how to create experiences that truly impact the outcome for our attendees, and I couldn’t be more excited for what’s ahead.”IgniteIt now owns:* The Cannabis Capital Conference, the premier investor and business gathering in the industry, with a track record of more than 20 successful events.
* The Cannabis Market Spotlight series, with three events planned through the end of 2025.
* The Cannabis Daily newsletter and the full archive of editorial content.
* An expansive library of cannabis-related insights, interviews, and reporting.

“IgniteIt is built on a proven foundation,” said Patrick Lane, CEO of IgniteIt. “We’ve spent years cultivating relationships, trust, and impact in the cannabis space. With this new chapter, we’re doubling down on storytelling, advocacy, and high-quality business events that accelerate opportunity in cannabis and beyond.”The founding team behind IgniteIt includes some of the most influential figures in cannabis media and events:* Jason Raznick, Founder of Benzinga, will serve as Chairman of IgniteIt.
* Patrick Lane, formerly EVP of Sales at Benzinga and creator of the Cannabis Capital Conference, will serve as CEO.

* Javier Hasse, former Managing Director of Benzinga Cannabis and current Editor-in-Chief of High Times, CEO of El Planteo and Senior Contributor at Forbes, joins as Co-Founder.

“We’ve watched companies go from newly licensed startups to market leaders, and many of those inflection points happened at our events,” said Elliot Lane, President & CRO of IgniteIt. “The Cannabis Capital Conference and our Market Spotlight events have become essential platforms for companies to meet investors, form partnerships, and accelerate their growth. That’s the power of curated, high-impact networking; and it’s what IgniteIt is built to deliver.”IgniteIt’s editorial mission will focus on nascent and fast-evolving industries, beginning with cannabis, offering in-depth reporting, op-eds from trusted voices, business trend analysis, and advocacy-driven content designed to empower industry leaders, entrepreneurs, and investors alike.

“For almost a decade, we’ve built credibility in this space,” added Javier Hasse. “With IgniteIt, we’re bringing together journalism and events to help build an industry that’s ethical, inclusive and built to last. Strong reporting and smart convening create real opportunity. For jobs, tax revenue, innovation and a culture that brings good to the world.”IgniteIt’s upcoming events will continue to serve as critical convening grounds for executives, investors, and policymakers shaping the future of cannabis and similar high-growth industries.
