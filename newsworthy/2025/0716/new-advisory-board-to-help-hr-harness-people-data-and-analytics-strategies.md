# New Advisory Board to Help HR Harness People Data and Analytics Strategies

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Jul 16, 2025 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — The HR Research Institute is proud to announce the formation of a new Advisory Board of industry experts to guide a major upcoming research initiative and virtual event focused on HR analytics.

As HR leaders face mounting pressure to connect business impact with workforce strategy, a newly formed State of People Analytics Advisory Board is stepping in to help. Comprising industry veterans, data experts, and forward-thinking practitioners, the board will guide HR professionals on one of their most complex challenges: leveraging people-focused metrics and analytics to drive smarter, fairer, and more effective workplace decisions.

The State of People Analytics Advisory Board was created to provide input and expertise in the design of an upcoming research study and insightful virtual event on these topics. Their insights will support HR leaders as they navigate skills gaps, shifting business demands, and accelerating technology—especially AI. The panel will play a critical role in providing practical frameworks and thought leadership on how to embed data and analytics into HR strategy, culture, and day-to-day operations.
