Merchants benefit from RTP, no NSF fees, reduced risk, and an intuitive, hardware-optional onboarding experience.

With next- day settlement, strong regulatory alignment, and loyalty-driven rewards, we’re giving high-risk merchants a reliable, growth-ready path forward. And we’re doing it with purpose, compassion, and precision.” — Mike Andrud, CEO of LütThis partnership represents a shared commitment to empowering underserved markets with resilient financial tools and a scalable path to growth.
