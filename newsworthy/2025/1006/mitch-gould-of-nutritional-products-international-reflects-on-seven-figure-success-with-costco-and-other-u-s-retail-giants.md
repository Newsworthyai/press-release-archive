# Mitch Gould of Nutritional Products International Reflects on Seven-Figure Success with Costco and Other U.S. Retail Giants

Boca Raton, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Oct 6, 2025 @ 7:00 AM US/Eastern — Mitch Gould, founder and CEO of Nutritional Products International (NPI), continues to highlight his track record of forging multi-million-dollar retail partnerships, including securing seven-figure deals with Costco, the third-largest retailer in the United States.

With over three decades of experience in the retail and consumer goods sector, Gould credits his success at Costco to understanding the company’s distinct business model—delivering value packs of well-known brands at highly competitive prices. This strategy has fueled Costco’s extraordinary growth, which now includes over 900 warehouses globally (including more than 600 in the U.S.) and a workforce of over 300,000, while 2024 net sales topped $250 billion.”

“Costco is a unique retail powerhouse built on loyalty and value,” said Gould. “The company’s model of offering trusted brands in bulk packs resonates with American households, and it’s been an honor to work directly with their team to bring products into that environment.”Throughout his career, Gould has built strong relationships with the nation’s top retailers, including Walmart, Home Depot, Lowe’s, Walgreens, CVS, and Rite Aid. He notes that while initial deals often came through in-person meetings, today much of the retailer engagement happens through major industry events and curated buyer showcases.
