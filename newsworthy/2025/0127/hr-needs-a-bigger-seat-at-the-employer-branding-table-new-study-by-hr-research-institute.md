# HR Needs a Bigger Seat at the Employer Branding Table - New Study by HR Research Institute

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Jan 27, 2025 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — The latest research report, HR.com's State of Employer Branding 2025, by the HR Research Institute highlights a critical finding: HR professionals must take a more active role in developing and maintaining employer brand strategies. The report reveals that while 62% of HR professionals rate their employer brand as above average or excellent at enhancing their company’s reputation, far fewer are confident in its impact on HR-specific priorities like talent attraction, engagement, and retention.

Specifically, less than half indicate that their employer brand is successful in enhancing:

* Diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB): 46%
* Talent attraction: 44%
* Employee engagement: 43%
* Employee retention: 42%

The findings also reveal a significant gap in intentional branding efforts. Just 28% of organizations have a comprehensive and consistently applied employer branding strategy, while 40% operate without any formal strategy in place.

Moreover, there is an imbalance in the ownership of employer brand strategy within organizations. Marketing or public relations is more likely to lead employer branding efforts (43%) than HR (25%), and this misalignment may prioritize reputation over HR-specific outcomes. A stronger collaboration between HR, marketing, and leadership teams is crucial to building a comprehensive employer brand that aligns business objectives with talent-focused goals.

Looking ahead, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to play a bigger role in shaping employer branding strategies:

* Improved candidate targeting and sourcing (41%)
* Personalized candidate experiences (36%)
* Automated recruitment processes (34%)
* Advanced analytics for brand measurement (34%)
* AI-driven content creation (34%)

Employers will need to adopt AI with care and thoughtful consideration, ensuring its application aligns with compliance standards, legal regulations, and industry best practices.

“HR professionals are uniquely positioned to ensure the employer brand reflects authentic workplace culture and supports critical initiatives like talent attraction and employee retention,” said Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator and CEO of HR.com. “It’s time to give HR a bigger seat at the table.”
