# Nutritional Products International Founder Mitch Gould Celebrates Four Decades of Industry Leadership

Boca Raton, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Aug 7, 2025 @ 6:00 AM US/Eastern — Mitch Gould, founder and CEO of Nutritional Products International (NPI), is celebrating more than four decades of industry-shaping achievements in brand building, product launches, and U.S. retail distribution. A globally recognized marketing executive, Gould has played a pivotal role in helping hundreds of companies successfully navigate the complexities of entering and scaling in the U.S. market.

Over the course of his 40+ year career, Gould has secured major product placements in leading retailers including Home Depot, Walmart, Costco, Walgreens, CVS, GNC, Vitamin Shoppe, and many more. Early in his career, he worked with some of the most recognized names in consumer products during the nationwide expansion of big-box retail. His ability to build relationships and close deals with major buyers and category managers helped brands achieve mass-market penetration and multimillion-dollar revenues.

“It’s been an incredible journey,” said Gould. “I’ve had the honor of working with some of the biggest names in retail and sports nutrition, and I’m proud of the platform we’ve built at NPI to help emerging brands succeed in the U.S.”In the early 2000s, Gould expanded his focus to the health, wellness, and sports nutrition sectors, representing high-profile athletes and celebrities including Hulk Hogan, Ronnie Coleman, Chuck Liddell, Bob Wall, and others. His success in placing their product lines in national retail chains helped launch a wave of fitness and lifestyle brands still relevant today.

When Amazon began expanding into health and wellness, Gould and NPI were tapped to assist in building out the platform’s sports nutrition category, which later evolved into Muscle Foods, a now-thriving segment of Amazon’s marketplace. His ability to anticipate trends and align with retail shifts positioned NPI as a strategic launch partner for both domestic and international companies.

Recognizing the recurring struggles of overseas brands entering the U.S. market, Gould developed the “Evolution of Distribution” — a turnkey platform that provides global brands with a streamlined, cost-effective pathway to enter the U.S. retail ecosystem. The Evolution of Distribution program includes everything from product importation and compliance to sales strategy, buyer outreach, and logistics support.

“Companies were coming to America and losing millions trying to do it themselves,” said Gould. “We created a single point of entry—a proven system that handles the heavy lifting and dramatically increases their chances of success.”NPI works in tandem with InHealth Media (IHM), a cost-effective PR and media agency also founded by Gould. IHM specializes in high-impact visibility campaigns across traditional media, digital platforms, influencers, and retail-focused publications. Together, NPI and IHM provide a full-service solution encompassing distribution, promotion, and sustained brand visibility.

Gould’s combined ventures continue to drive success for brands ranging from startup entrepreneurs to established multinational companies looking to scale in the U.S.
