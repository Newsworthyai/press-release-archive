# Ted Ginn Jr. and the Ginn Foundation Team Up with the World Series of Cornhole

Columbus, Ohio (Newsworthy.ai) Saturday Aug 23, 2025 @ 6:00 AM Central — The World Series of Cornhole (WSOC), held in Columbus Ohio on August 29-30, 2025, today announced a featured partnership with Ted Ginn Jr. and the Ginn Foundation, spotlighting a shared mission to expand opportunities for young people through sport, mentorship, and education.

As one of WSOC’s charitable beneficiaries, the Ginn Foundation will be front and center across WSOC’s signature experiences—including the Heisman Toast VIP gatherings, the high‑drama LEGENDS Shootout Cornhole Tournament, the fan‑favorite Miss Cornhole competition, and the VIP Tailgate—where fans and legends come together for fun, competition, and real community impact.

 “All the main beneficiaries of my foundation are the kids,” said Ted Ginn Jr. “If you track the kids from 2015—or even earlier—to now, you’ll see the progress and where they are today. If you like your kids, you save a family.”

 A Mission Built for Impact: Inside the [Ginn Foundation](https://www.ginnfoundation.org/about)The Ginn Foundation serves as a community hub anchored by Ginn Academy and Ginn Elite Sports. Together they provide a structured pathway—on and off the field—so young people can stay active, focus on academics, and avoid the distractions that can derail potential.

* Ginn Academy & Feeder System: The foundation’s model connects early development to high‑school excellence (rooted in the Glenville tradition) and onward to college readiness—“a way to keep the kids active and not get caught up in a lot of trouble.”
* Ginn Elite Sports: Year‑round training, travel competition, and big‑stage opportunities—including a national youth program trip to Florida for champions each December—create clear targets and tangible rewards for hard work.

“I have three kids at The Ohio State University as we speak,” Ginn said. “Without the Ginn Elite program, these guys wouldn’t have had the opportunity—or the push—to want to go. It’s not just about Ohio State. It’s about giving every kid a shot. Any donation goes straight back to the kids.”

How to Follow & Learn More: Ginn directs supporters to the foundation’s digital footprint—Ginn Elite Sports and Ginn Academy across Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook—where the mission, day‑to‑day work, and student progress are documented.

Why WSOC + Ginn Foundation WorksWSOC is engineered to pair sports legends with passionate fans—and channel that energy into funding for youth foundations, veterans and military families, mental health initiatives, and disaster relief. Ginn’s vision aligns point‑for‑point with the WSOC playbook:

* Sport that Includes Everyone: “The World Series of Cornhole brings multiple races together,” Ginn said. “It brings out competitiveness—and it’s different. We do 7‑on‑7, basketball, softball, even kickball, but cornhole doesn’t usually get the spotlight.”
* Competition Without the Wear and Tear: “Cornhole is about accuracy, knowing the game, preparing to compete. There are rules and strategy, but not a lot of physical impact—so more people can play, and keep playing.”
* A Stage for Giving: WSOC’s format builds natural moments—VIP toasts, tournament showdowns, tailgate hype—where live fundraising, raffles, and fan‑experience packages raise dollars without slowing the show.

Ginn on WSOC: From the Boards to the CauseA proud product of The Ohio State University and a veteran of football’s biggest stages, Ginn is competitive by nature—and cornhole is no exception.

“I play cornhole—and I think I’m pretty good,” he said with a grin. “We go back and forth, but I’m usually the one on top. WSOC lets me test that, while doing something meaningful. That’s the best of both worlds.”

Ginn also sees WSOC as a reunion stage for athletes and fans whose rivalries and highlights shaped their love for the game.

“We’ve got Heisman brothers in Troy [Smith] and Ricky [Williams], and me and Vince [Young] did amazing things in high school, college, and the pros. WSOC brings that all together—for a purpose.”

“I Am the Community”: How Giving Back Fuels EverythingGinn’s commitment to service isn’t an add‑on—it’s the throughline of his career.

“Giving back has opened doors for the guys coming behind me,” he said. “Since my sophomore year, I’ve tried to help people stay who they are—on the field and off. You’re not just changing a life; you’re changing society.”What he enjoys most about events like WSOC: “I am the community,” Ginn said simply—summarizing why he shows up, stays late, and keeps building.

Rivalries, Memories, and the Mindset of a CompetitorGinn’s favorite rivalries read like a highlight reel—Ohio State–Michigan, Browns–Steelers, and a carousel of NFC/AFC showdowns from Saints–Panthers to Dolphins–Jets. As for the memory that sticks?

“2004, Marshall,” he recalled. “The walk, the tunnel, the pregame—all the Ohio State traditions—and then getting on the field and playing. A lot of guys experience the moment and then sit. I got to play. I came in as a DB and walked out a receiver. Never looked back.”How Fans Can Support the Ginn Foundation at WSOC

* Give during live moments: Bid in the live fundraising segments, raise your paddle in the fund‑a‑need, and enter raffles tied to exclusive experiences.
* Follow and amplify: Share posts from Ginn Elite Sports and Ginn Academy across social channels to spotlight student success stories.
* Keep the momentum going: Donations fuel travel, training, academic support, and championship opportunities—“another $100 becomes another door open for a kid.”

“Whenever you hear or see you can donate—do it,” Ginn said. “You aren’t doing anything but changing a life.”
