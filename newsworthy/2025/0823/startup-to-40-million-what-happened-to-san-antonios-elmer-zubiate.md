# Startup to $40 Million: What Happened to San Antonio’s Elmer Zubiate

San Antonio, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Saturday Aug 23, 2025 @ 5:00 AM UTC — Elmer Zubiate, CEO of Zooby Neighborhood Superheroes Inc. [www.zooby.com], recently joined Todd Liles—the CEO & Founder of Service Excellence Training [www.servextra.com] and the PRESS PLAY Training System—to drop candid insights on The Contractor Fight Podcast. It’s a two‑part conversation that gets real about building strong companies and even stronger teams.

In the first episode [link], “The Brutal Truth About Building a $40M Business Without Selling Your Soul,” Elmer Zubiate walks us through the highs and lows of scaling his business. He shares how he kept his integrity intact while growing Elmer’s Home Services into a Texas powerhouse, then selling his company to private equity investors.

He shares the decisions that nearly sank the company, the sacrifices most entrepreneurs never talk about, and the principles that kept him from cutting corners when it mattered most. Listeners will hear why chasing revenue at the expense of values leads to burnout, how to balance rapid growth with long-term stability, and the mindset shifts that separate businesses that fizzle from those that endure.

The second episode, “How to Lead, Build, and Keep High‑Performance Teams” is where Elmer Zubiate explains why culture beats perks every time. Elmer Zubiate discusses how team loyalty is fostered through clarity, rather than perks, and how regular communication prevents talent drain in competitive markets. Elmer Zubiate gives leaders a blueprint for building teams that want to stay and grow. This episode is a practical guide for anyone looking to turn a group of employees into a united, high-performance team. Finally, Elmer Zubiate publicly discusses his vision for his newest venture, Zooby Neighborhood Superheroes Inc., for the first time.

“Elmer makes it clear: customers win when your team feels valued,” said Todd Liles, who is an expert in training home services companies. “That’s business done right.”

Zooby Neighborhood Superheroes is a modern home services company built for people who expect better. No hourly billing. No contractor drama. Just honest, flat-rate services done right the first time. Home repairs without the headaches. Maintenance without the mystery. Upgrades without the upsell.
