# ORGANA International Shines Light on Hidden Nutrient Gaps in the American Diet

Springville, UT (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Oct 14, 2025 @ 6:00 AM US/Mountain — Most Americans think they eat well enough, but research shows otherwise. ORGANA International, a pioneer in natural mineral-based wellness since 1997, is drawing attention to what it calls the “hidden nutrient crisis” — the growing lack of essential trace minerals in modern diets — and offering natural, bioavailable solutions to help close the gap.

“For decades, we’ve been told to eat our fruits and vegetables, but even the healthiest foods today often lack the nutrients they once contained,” said Larry Mills, CEO of ORGANA International. “Soil depletion, over-farming, and early harvesting mean that the minerals our bodies rely on simply aren’t there anymore. ORGANA’s mission has always been to give people back what the modern food system has taken away.”The Hidden Crisis Beneath the SurfaceAccording to USDA data, many Americans fall short on vital minerals such as magnesium, potassium, and iron — nutrients that play a critical role in energy production, immune response, and overall wellness. Studies suggest that as much as half of the U.S. population may be deficient in magnesium alone. ORGANA’s leadership believes this widespread nutrient shortfall contributes to fatigue, poor recovery, and declining vitality across all age groups.

ORGANA International’s multi-mineral drink and complementary products are designed to restore these missing elements naturally. Derived from decomposed plant matter containing 76 trace minerals and fulvic acid, ORGANA’s formulations provide minerals in a living, bioavailable form. The company’s testing process confirms Brownian movement — microscopic activity that shows the particles are still “alive” — and with a particle size of just 20 nanometers, the minerals can pass through the skin barrier and down to the cellular level.

Nature’s Formula, Delivered NaturallyORGANA’s line includes its flagship multi-mineral drink (available in natural, cherry, wildberry pomegranate, and peach mango flavors), magnesium cream for muscle relief, liquid oxygen supplements, silver-based immune support, and Essiac tea for detoxification. All products are made with pharmaceutical-grade water and natural ingredients, ensuring purity, safety, and maximum absorption.

“Most supplements are synthetic or poorly absorbed,” Mills said. “Our minerals come directly from the earth — they’re natural, ionic, and bioavailable. Your body takes what it needs and safely eliminates the rest. That’s what makes ORGANA so effective.”Educating for a Healthier FutureORGANA International hopes to increase awareness around mineral depletion and empower consumers to make more informed choices about their health. Through upcoming educational initiatives and partnerships, the company plans to share more about how fulvic minerals support cellular regeneration and help the body function at its best.

“As we continue to grow, our goal isn’t just to sell products — it’s to educate,” Mills added. “When people understand how nutrient gaps affect their health, they can make smarter choices. We want to be part of that awakening.”Available on AmazonORGANA International’s complete line of mineral-rich wellness products is conveniently available for purchase on Amazon.com, giving consumers nationwide easy access to the brand’s natural, bioavailable formulations.
