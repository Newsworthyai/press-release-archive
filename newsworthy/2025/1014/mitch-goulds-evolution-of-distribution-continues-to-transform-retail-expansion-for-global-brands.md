# Mitch Gould’s “Evolution of Distribution” Continues to Transform Retail Expansion for Global Brands

Boca Raton, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Oct 14, 2025 @ 7:00 PM US/Eastern — Mitch Gould, founder and CEO of Nutritional Products International (NPI), continues to reshape how international health and wellness brands enter and thrive in the U.S. marketplace with his groundbreaking “Evolution of Distribution” model—a turnkey, one-stop single platform that can import, distribute, and promote products seamlessly from a single source. This comprehensive system seamlessly integrates importation, distribution, compliance, and marketing—delivering a faster, smarter path to retail success.

For more than three decades, Gould has refined this approach to meet the ever-changing demands of global commerce. Today, his model provides a one-stop U.S. launch platform that eliminates costly fragmentation across logistics, regulatory, and promotional functions.

“International brands face enormous challenges breaking into the U.S. market,” said Gould. “Our system bridges every gap—from importation to retail placement—so our clients can stay focused on innovation while we handle execution.”Backed by an experienced team and sister company InHealth Media (IHM), NPI supports every stage of the product life cycle—from retail strategy and buyer outreach to social, digital, and television marketing. Gould’s ecosystem has helped numerous brands land placement on Amazon, Walmart.com, and other major retailers, all while optimizing visibility and consumer engagement.

“We let manufacturers do what they do best—create great products,” Gould added. “NPI and IHM take care of the rest.”The Evolution of Distribution framework offers an efficient and cost-effective way for brands to accelerate retail growth without the overhead of building an internal U.S. infrastructure. The result: faster market access, measurable ROI, and long-term brand traction in one of the most competitive industries in the world.
