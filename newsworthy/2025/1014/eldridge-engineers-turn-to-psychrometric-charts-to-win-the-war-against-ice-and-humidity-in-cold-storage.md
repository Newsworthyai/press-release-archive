# Eldridge Engineers Turn to Psychrometric Charts to Win the War Against Ice and Humidity in Cold Storage

Houston, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Oct 14, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Central — In the world of cold storage, temperature often takes center stage. But according to Eldridge, a leading provider of industrial ventilation and dehumidification solutions, the true enemy is moisture — an invisible force that undermines safety, efficiency, and profitability in temperature-controlled facilities across the nation.

“In cold storage, humidity is the silent saboteur,” said Clayton Settle, Project Manager at Eldridge. “The solution begins with understanding air and that’s what the psychrometric chart allows us to do.”Humidity: The Hidden Hazard in Cold StorageCold storage facilities typically operate between 0°F and 40°F, but these low temperatures don’t create humidity — they amplify it. Warm, moist air infiltrating a cold environment can result in three major problems:

* Coil Frosting: Frost accumulates on coolingcoils, insulating them and drastically reducing efficiency.
* Icing & Fogging Hazards: Rapid flash-freezing and poorvisibility create major safety risks for workers and equipment.
* Energy Waste: Frequent defrost cycles andlatent heat removal drive up operational costs.

“Humidity doesn’t just make conditions uncomfortable — it makes them unsafe and expensive,” Settle explained. “The dew point, not just the thermometer, determines success in cold storage design.”Engineering Precision with the Psychrometric ChartEldridge engineers are using psychrometric charts to model and control air’s thermodynamic properties — transforming the way industrial facilities manage humidity.

By plotting dry-bulb, wet-bulb, and dew point temperatures, engineers can visualize when and where condensation or frost will form, then design ventilation and dehumidification systems that keep air safely below its dew point.

In one recent case study, Eldridge modeled outside air at 94°F dry-bulb / 78°F wet-bulb and compared it to a 35°F cold storage environment. The resulting 90-grains-per-pound moisture differential guided precise sizing of desiccant dehumidifiers, preventing frost formation and ensuring safe, energy-efficient operations.

From Reactive to Proactive SafetyThe psychrometric chart isn’t just a classroom diagram — it’s becoming a blueprint for modern cold-chain management. By understanding air behavior in advance, facility managers can identify high-risk zones, reduce maintenance cycles, and protect workers before hazards occur.

“By mastering humidity control, companies can move from reacting to problems to preventing them entirely,” Settle added. “It’s about smarter engineering — not just colder air.”About [Eldridge](https://eldridgeusa.com/)Established in 1946 as L.C.
