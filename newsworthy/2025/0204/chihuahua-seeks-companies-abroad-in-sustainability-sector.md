# Chihuahua Seeks Companies Abroad in Sustainability Sector

Chihuahua, Mexico (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Feb 4, 2025 @ 10:10 AM US/Central — Chihuahua, an already prosperous state with an extended history of business growth, is now launching an ambitious and strategic plan to attract small- to mid-sized companies to build with their local business ecosystem. Startup Chihuahua is working with local business leaders, government stakeholders, and other rainmakers, from both Mexico and abroad, to selectively target and invite businesses in renewable energy, resource management and urban sustainability to join the region’s already thriving sustainability sector.

“The progress we have seen in the region in the past few years shows the power of collaboration in seizing near-shoring opportunities. We welcome companies to invest and continue growing here, where they will find opportunities for sustainable development and a thriving business community in an integrated and supportive ecosystem.” Ulises Fernández, Innovation and Economic Development Secretariat, Chihuahua State Government.

For each of the areas of business, Startup Chihuahua aims to find enterprises that can grow along with that local industry, by either providing efficiency enhancements, products, or consumer-centric solutions. In return, the companies can enjoy local collaboration opportunities, possible local customers, and entrepreneurial support. Relocating companies can also gain access to capital investments, equity-free grant money, opportunities for corporate sponsorship, workforce development initiatives, and networking with local industry leadership.

Chihuahua City is the capital of the State of Chihuahua, Mexico, which shares the largest Mexican border with the United States. This strategic hub for air, road and rail travel hosts many international meetings. Its residents enjoy a safe, clean and affordable city with a thriving middle class, a robust education system and local universities.

Startup Chihuahua is an organization that promotes and supports entrepreneurship, with a focus on science, technology, innovation and sustainability. It is currently working with Tech Ranch, in Austin, Texas, and other key business leaders to further build a stable and prosperous business sector in sustainability-related fields.
