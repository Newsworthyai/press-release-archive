# How NPI Brought European Sports Nutrition Brand Scitec Nutrition® into the US Marketplace — A Blueprint for Global Brands Entering the U.S.

Boca Raton, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Aug 19, 2025 @ 9:00 AM US/Eastern — Mitch Gould, founder and CEO of Nutritional Products International (NPI), has built his career on helping global brands break into the complex U.S. retail market. One of those success stories is Scitec Nutrition, a European sports nutrition powerhouse that, with NPI’s guidance, secured its first placement in The Vitamin Shoppe — a milestone that marked the start of its American presence.

Founded in Hungary in 1996, Scitec Nutrition has grown into one of Europe’s largest and most respected sports nutrition brands, with more than 700 product formulations, 135 proprietary flavor systems, and distribution in over 90 countries. The company operates 115 retail stores across Europe, manufactures over 30 million pounds of powders annually, and is backed by a team of more than 50 IFBB professional athletes and fitness competitors with a combined following of over 10 million people.

When Scitec set its sights on the U.S. market, the brand turned to NPI’s proprietary “Evolution of Distribution” system — a turnkey platform Gould created to give international companies a streamlined, cost-effective path into U.S. retail. The program handles everything from compliance and importation to sales strategy, buyer introductions, and logistics.

“Helping a global leader like Scitec get into The Vitamin Shoppe is exactly why we built NPI,” said Mitch Gould, Founder and CEO of NPI. “We’ve spent decades building relationships with category buyers, understanding how to position products for U.S. retail, and executing launches that give overseas brands a real foothold in this market. What we achieved with Scitec proves we can do the same for others right now.”NPI’s work with Scitec included presenting the brand to key buyers at ECRM’s annual conference, where top vitamin, diet, and nutrition suppliers pitch programs to major brick-and-mortar and online retailers. This visibility, combined with NPI’s established retail connections, led directly to Scitec’s debut in The Vitamin Shoppe.

“When entering a new market, having local expertise is essential,” said Attila Szabó, Head of the Hungarian business of Scitec Nutrition. “NPI brought that expertise and introduced us to the right channels. Their team was instrumental in helping us move from a dominant European presence to gaining premium shelf space in the U.S. This is only the beginning of the American Scitec story.”With the U.S. sports nutrition market continuing to grow — driven by both hardcore athletes and an expanding base of casual users — Gould and NPI remain focused on helping international brands replicate Scitec’s success and achieve lasting U.S. distribution.
