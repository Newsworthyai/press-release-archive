# Pharos Beverages Now Available on Tap in Wisconsin

Billings, Montana (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Aug 19, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Eastern — In an exciting move for THC infused beverages that puts Wisconsin at the forefront of cannabis beverage innovation, Pharos Brands is proud to announce the statewide launch of its THC-infused beverage kegs, making Pharos one of the first brands to bring THC on tap to Wisconsin taverns.

Available exclusively in the Blood Orange Lime flavor, each keg contains a microdosed hemp-derived THC beverage designed for sessionable enjoyment and social connection. This launch marks a major milestone in the evolution of cannabis beverage distribution, from packaged cans to on-premise draft service.

The rollout arrives alongside several strategic moves that the brand is making to make its beverage available nationwide. This will include a spotlight on both Pharos and the pioneering taverns serving THC on tap. Taverns participating in the launch are invited to submit photos and details on social media @pharosbrands, which is expected to generate global attention in the infused beverage category and local press coverage throughout Wisconsin.

“This moment is bigger than just one beverage, it’s about reshaping how we gather, enjoy, and elevate our social rituals,” said Mary Bernuth, Co-Founder and President of Pharos Brands. “Wisconsin has a long history of tavern culture, and we’re proud to be part of its next chapter by offering the first THC beverage kegs available for on-premise service in the state.”“The new development of Hemp derived THC on Tap, is an exciting opportunity as we see a consumer shift towards alternatives to alcohol. As taverns seek ways to accommodate this demand, offering a THC version on tap can provide a great means for consumer trial, and a reasonable price point. With the demand for beer declining over the years, taverns have unused tap lines which can now be utilized for THC on tap, thus offering another revenue stream. With only a 5mg dosage, Pharos offers a gentle potency and delivers a great tasting, premium beverage using all-natural ingredients, no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives, that many consumers find as a healthy alternative. We are proud to partner with Pharos in Wisconsin, and offering these kegs to taverns across the entire state.” said Jerry Zavorka, Badger Cannabis, a wholly owned subsidiary of Capitol-Husting/Allstate Liquor & Wine Company

Already leading the charge are several pioneering Wisconsin establishments that now feature Pharos on tap:

* Orsetta in De Pere
* Whitetail Inn in St. Germain
* The Phoenix Taproom & Kitchen in Eau Claire

These venues will be showcasing Wisconsin’s emergence as one of the first states to legally serve THC beverages on tap — a historic moment for both the hospitality and cannabis industries.
