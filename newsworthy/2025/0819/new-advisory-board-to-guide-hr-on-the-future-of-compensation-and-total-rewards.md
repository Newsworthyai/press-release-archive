# New Advisory Board to Guide HR on the Future of Compensation and Total Rewards

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Aug 19, 2025 @ 9:00 AM America/Toronto — The HR Research Institute (HRRI) has announced the formation of HR.com’s Future of Compensation and Total Rewards Advisory Board. This panel of industry experts will help HR professionals optimize one of the most critical—and rapidly evolving—areas of talent management.

The advisory board will guide an upcoming research study and virtual event on the future of compensation and total rewards, providing HR leaders with actionable takeaways to attract, retain, and engage talent.

Total rewards—the combination of pay, benefits, and other rewards employees receive—has long been a cornerstone of HR strategy. As the competition for talent intensifies, leading employers are rethinking traditional approaches, personalizing offerings, and tying pay more closely to performance.
