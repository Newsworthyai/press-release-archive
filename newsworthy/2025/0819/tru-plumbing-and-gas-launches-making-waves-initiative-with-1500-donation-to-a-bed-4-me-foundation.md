# Tru Plumbing and Gas Launches “Making Waves” Initiative with $1,500 Donation to A Bed 4 Me Foundation

Niceville, FL (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Aug 19, 2025 @ 10:11 AM US/Central — Tru Plumbing and Gas has launched its new Making Waves charitable giving program with a $1,500 donation to A Bed 4 Me Foundation. The monthly initiative directs $10 from every completed service call to a handpicked local nonprofit making a difference in the community. In July, the program’s first month, the company completed 150 plumbing service calls, raising the inaugural donation.

Cody Kearns, CEO of Tru Plumbing and Gas, says launching Making Waves with A Bed 4 Me Foundation was the perfect way to start the program. “A Bed 4 Me’s mission to give beds to kids was near and dear to my heart. I’m so grateful they were on board to partner with us as our first charity of the month. We know we can make waves in our community one drop at a time. Stay tuned, because we’re just getting started!”

Diane Freeman, Executive Director of A Bed 4 Me Foundation, said the support will have a lasting impact. "We’re so thankful to Tru Plumbing and Gas for choosing A Bed 4 Me as the first charity in their new Making Waves initiative. Their generosity means more children in Okaloosa and Walton counties will have a bed of their own, which is something many of us take for granted. Support like this helps us spread the word about how important a safe, comfortable place to sleep is for every child."

A Bed 4 Me Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization with a mission to ensure that children have a place of their own to sleep each night by providing a bedding kit at no cost to qualified families throughout Okaloosa and Walton counties. Their volunteers have found children sleeping on the floor, on couches, or squeezed into beds with their parents and siblings. Good sleep is crucial for children and impacts their health, self-esteem, and academic performance.

Tru Plumbing and Gas is a full-service plumbing company based in Niceville and serving Okaloosa, Walton, and Santa Rosa counties. Tru Plumbing and Gas offers plumbing for new construction and remodels, gas line repair and installation, and 24/7 emergency service. Founded in 2020 by Cody Kearns, the company is heavily involved in the community through charitable giving, a free yearly fall festival called Trufest, and partnerships with Okaloosa County CTE, the Building Industry Association of Okaloosa-Walton Counties, and Future Builders of America.
