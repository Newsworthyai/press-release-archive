# From Bill Burr to Rising Stars: Comedy Village Turns One in Times Square

New York, NY (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Aug 19, 2025 @ 3:00 PM Eastern — Since opening its doors in August 2024, Comedy Village has quickly become Times Square’s premier stage for stand-up comedy. In just one year, the club has drawn legendary performers including Bill Burr, T.J. Miller, Dave Attell, Judah Friedlander, Ben Bailey, and Donnell Rawlings, while also spotlighting a new generation of talent like Eagle Witt and Brittany Brave. The result is a venue where comedy icons and rising stars share the same stage — and audiences experience the full spectrum of what stand-up has to offer.

Founded by longtime New York comedian, actor, veteran, and writer PJ Landers, Comedy Village was built on the vision of blending an upscale, audience-first atmosphere with the energy of a classic New York comedy club. With shows seven nights a week — two Sunday through Thursday and three every Friday and Saturday — the club has quickly become a hub for sharp observational humor, fearless political satire, and everything in between.

“One year ago, we set out to create a space where audiences could feel the raw, unfiltered magic of stand-up comedy — and where both legends and newcomers could shine,” said Landers. “Today, we’re proud to see Comedy Village become not just a stage, but a community. And we’re only getting started.”To celebrate its first anniversary, Comedy Village is thanking fans with a special offer: 50% off tickets this week only with code HappyBirthday. It’s the perfect chance for newcomers and loyal fans alike to experience Times Square’s home for comedy.
