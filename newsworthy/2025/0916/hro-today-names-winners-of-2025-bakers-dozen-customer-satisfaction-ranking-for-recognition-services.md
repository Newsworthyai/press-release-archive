# HRO Today Names Winners of 2025 Baker’s Dozen Customer Satisfaction Ranking for Recognition Services

Philadelphia, PA (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Sep 16, 2025 @ 10:00 AM Eastern — To determine an overall ranking from this data, HRO Today analyzes results across three subcategories: service breadth, size of deals, and quality of service. Using a predetermined algorithm that weighs questions and categories based on importance, HRO Today calculates scores in all three subcategories as well as an overall score. This year, there were over 300 usable surveys completed from 223 different client companies of the ranked providers.

The Top 5 in the ranking are:1. Workhuman
2. Madison Recognition
3. C. A. Short
4. Engage2Excel
5. Point Recognition

HRO Today collects feedback annually through an online survey which they distribute to buyers directly through the HRO Today mailing lists and indirectly through service providers. Only those organizations that earned the highest ratings from their customers for quality of service, breadth of service and size of deals are part of the ranking. Based solely on feedback from buyers of the rated services, the ratings are not based on the opinion of the HRO Today staff.
