# Psylutions Founder Stresses importance of licensed regulated producers in the wake of findings of Mislabeling in Psychedelic Edibles

Denver, Colorado (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Sep 16, 2025 @ 1:05 PM Mountain — In light of a recent Scientific American report revealing that several “magic mushroom” edibles contained no psilocybin and, in some cases, undisclosed synthetic substances, Psylutions Founder & CEO Rhonda DeSantis issued the following statement. DeSantis emphasized the critical importance of regulated pathways, third-party testing, and transparent labeling to ensure patient safety and trust as psychedelic medicine advances.

 Statement from Rhonda DeSantis, Founder & CEO of Psylutions:

 “The recent findings highlighted by Scientific American underscore the very real risks of purchasing unregulated psychedelic products. When people seeking psychedelic treatment buy items labeled as psilocybin edibles only to discover they contain undisclosed or synthetic substances, they put their health and safety at risk.

 Even when a product does actually contain psilocybin, the labeling is often completely misleading. A product labeled as 4,000 mg is typically just 4 grams of dried mushroom material—without any indication of the actual psilocybin content. This creates a dangerous and confusing disconnect, as weight alone has nothing to do with potency. True safety and precision in psychedelic medicine require accurate labeling in milligrams of active compounds, not arbitrary dry weight.

 At Psylutions, our mission is to ensure that patients have access to safe, reliable, and effective psychedelic medicine. Every product we produce undergoes rigorous third-party laboratory testing and strict quality controls to confirm potency, purity, and consistency. Transparency in labeling and adherence to legal, science-backed standards are not optional—they are essential for building trust and protecting public health.

 This is precisely why regulated pathways matter. Legal and responsibly developed psychedelic medicines offer patients the safeguards and confidence they deserve. Psylutions will continue to lead by example, demonstrating that innovation and integrity must go hand in hand in this emerging field.”
