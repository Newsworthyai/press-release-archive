# Strong Relationships and Employee Growth Options Drive Positive Employee Experiences - New Study by HR Research Institute

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Apr 7, 2025 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — A new research study reveals that strong relationships and opportunities for growth are the foundation of a positive employee experience. The study, conducted by HR.com’s HR Research Institute, explores the human experience in today’s organizations and highlights where HR leaders must focus to overcome key challenges.

The report, HR.com’s Future of Human Experience 2025, examines the findings that organizations with higher levels of employee experience see significantly stronger outcomes, including greater engagement, productivity, and innovation. However, only 41% of respondents rate the employee experience at their organizations as “very good,” signaling an urgent need for improvement.

According to the study, the top factors positively impacting employee experience include:

* Camaraderie and friendships with coworkers (59%)
* A sense of meaning and purpose in work (51%)
* Opportunities to learn and grow (49%)

Despite these insights, many organizations struggle to create a consistently positive employee experience. The findings identify major roadblocks, including:

* Heavy workloads (51%)
* Limited opportunities for advancement (47%)
* Employee burnout (47%)

“Employees thrive when they feel connected, valued, and supported,” said Debbie McGrath, CEO of HR.com. “Employers often overlook the impact of fostering a positive work environment and empowering their employees to reach their full potential.”

The full research report, HR.com’s Future of Human Experience 2025, is available for free download and provides a roadmap for organizations seeking to enhance employee experiences and, in turn, drive long-term success.

The recording of the research webcast presentation, The Rise and Impact of “Employee Experience,” is available for viewing 24/7 on demand.
