The Literacy Crisis:

A Call to Action. Literacy is one of the most urgent challenges in education today. The data is staggering:

* 66% of 4th graders and 69% of 8th graders lack reading proficiency (NAEP, 2022)
* 9+ grade levels span reading abilities in a single 3rd-grade classroom—and up to 11.6 grade levels in 5th grade (Hindman, 2013)
* 10.4% of students in public schools are English Language Learners (NCES, 2022)
* 21% of U.S. adults (48 million) have low literacy skills, often reading below a 3rd-grade level (NCES, 2022)

Ojje was created to close these gaps and ensure every student has the opportunity to thrive.
