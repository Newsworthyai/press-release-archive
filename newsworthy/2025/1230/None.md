# Lionheart Health, through Leonhardt Ventures LLC, Files Patent for Bioelectric Platform to Enhance Peptide Uptake and Longevity Therapies

Huntington Beach, California (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Dec 30, 2025 @ 7:30 AM Pacific — Lionheart Health, Inc., via Leonhardt Ventures LLC, announced the filing of a provisional patent application for a bioelectric stimulation platform designed to significantly enhance peptide uptake and biological effectiveness across oral, topical, and injectable delivery methods.

 The invention addresses a persistent challenge in both biotech and longevity medicine: translating promising peptide biology into consistent, real-world outcomes. The platform is designed to improve absorption and signaling efficiency across key healthspan-related pathways, including klotho, sirtuins, sestrins, apelin, LIM, BDNF, SDF1, PDGF, VEGF, S100a, and related proteins.

 Up to 70% of IV delivery is lost and up to 99.9% of oral and topical deliveries are lost with current peptide delivery methods.

 Delivery Route % Lost / Filtered / Ineffective % Reaching Target Tissues (Functional) Oral 90–99.9% 0.1–10% (often <1%)Topical 80–99% 1–20% (mostly local)IV 30–70% 30–70% (systemic, uneven)

 Peptides are a rapidly expanding area of research in longevity science, yet delivery and bioavailability remain limiting factors. By applying controlled bioelectric stimulation, the technology aims to enhance peptide efficacy and uptake, with early experimental data indicating improvements of up to 300 percent. This may enable lower dosing while maintaining or increasing therapeutic impact.

 Lionheart Health is recognized for its leadership in klotho-based longevity research and was recently named a Top 40 semifinalist in the XPRIZE Healthspan competition. The company holds multiple issued patents related to klotho technologies, with additional applications pending.

 The patent builds on decades of bioelectric medicine research conducted by Leonhardt Ventures and expands Lionheart Health’s proprietary platform for modulating cellular environments to optimize peptide and protein activity. Precisely tuned bioelectric signals are designed to enhance barrier transport, receptor interaction, and downstream tissue-level effects.

 “This filing represents a major step forward in making advanced peptide-based longevity interventions more efficient, predictable, and scalable, By combining peptides with bioelectric signaling, we believe we can unlock significantly greater biological impact at lower doses, across multiple routes of administration,” stated Howard J. Leonhardt, Executive Chairman, Inventor and co-CEO of Lionheart Health, Inc. and CEO of Leonhardt Ventures LLC

 

 Key Innovation Highlights

 • Broad Delivery Coverage

 Patent claims encompass oral, topical, and injectable peptide delivery enhanced by targeted bioelectric stimulation.

 • Healthspan & Longevity Focus

 Designed to support muscle, brain, immune, metabolic, aesthetic, cardiovascular, and regenerative health.

 • Klotho-Centric Applications

 Special emphasis on peptides that enhance Klotho activity, a protein closely linked to aging regulation and cellular resilience.

 

 Mechanisms of Action (Patent-Described Concepts)

 • Enhanced Transmembrane Transport

 Bioelectric fields modulate membrane potential to facilitate peptide passage across epithelial and cellular membranes.

 • Improved Barrier Permeability

 Temporary, reversible changes to tight junction behavior in the gut and skin improve oral and topical peptide absorption.

 • Receptor Sensitization

 Electrical signaling increases receptor availability and responsiveness, improving peptide binding efficiency.

 • Intracellular Trafficking Optimization

 Bioelectric cues influence cytoskeletal dynamics and endosomal pathways to reduce peptide degradation and increase functional delivery.

 • Dose Efficiency Amplification

 Enhanced uptake allows for lower peptide doses while maintaining or increasing biological effects.

 • Synergistic Klotho Signaling

 Electrical stimulation is designed to favor cellular environments that amplify Klotho-related pathways tied to longevity and tissue protection.

 

 Potential Strategic Impact

 The newly filed intellectual property strengthens Lionheart Health’s position at the intersection of bioelectric medicine and peptide therapeutics, creating opportunities for:

 • Next-generation longevity and wellness protocols

 • Licensed clinical and research applications

 • Integration into future Lionheart Health devices, programs, and clinical studies

 New studies include a combination of bioelectric stimulation enhanced peptides (klotho) with PEMF, electromagnetic high intensity RF, LED light, vibrational therapy, sauna, cold plunge, hyperbaric oxygen, BodStim TM enhanced exercise, healthy klotho-favoring diet, and customized supplements including pre and pro biotics.

 The company plans to incorporate the technology into selected upcoming healthspan initiatives and investigational protocols, while pursuing strategic partnerships and licensing opportunities.
