# Ketamine Lead Gen Announces Strategic Partnership with HealingMaps and Healing Health Alliance, Powering Growth for Ketamine &amp; TMS Clinics

San Diego, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Aug 27, 2025 @ 9:00 AM US/Pacific — Ketamine Lead Gen, the preferred partner for lead generation, digital marketing, and wellness clinic growth, today announced a strategic partnership with HealingMaps and the newly formed Healing Health Alliance. The collaboration aligns trusted patient education and search, strategic digital marketing, and group purchasing/operations to help Ketamine and TMS clinics grow responsibly, profitably, and at scale.

“Clinic owners need one connected system that turns high-intent leads into booked patients, while reducing costs as they grow,” said Jake Bastien, CEO & Founder, Ketamine Lead Gen. “By bringing together HealingMaps’ patient discovery platform with Ketamine Lead Gen’s marketing and lead generation engine and Healing Health Alliance’ purchasing and operational advantages, we’re delivering exactly that: a clear, measurable, and sustainable path to clinic growth.”HealingMaps was created to offer accurate, honest information about psychedelic-assisted therapy, including integrative mental health, Ketamine clinics, TMS therapy providers across the United States, and retreats globally, while helping people find qualified providers in their area. Inspired by groundbreaking research and expanding access to care, HealingMaps is on a journey to become the world’s most informative and trusted psychedelic-therapy search site.

“With this collaboration, patients gain clarity and confidence, and clinics gain visibility where research begins,” said Cory Jones, CEO & Co-Founder, HealingMaps. “Together, we connect unbiased education with verified clinics and a compliant route to care.”The Healing Health Alliance is the first national provider network and GPO (Group Purchasing Organization) exclusively for the ketamine industry. Some of the initial opportunities we are providing our members are:

* Up to 20% off your medical supplies
* Up to 30% off credit card processing fees (often without having to change processors - ketamine clinics are typically charged higher fees)
* Employer retention plans, forensic insurance reimbursement audits (to identify reimbursement left on the table), and more merchant services
* Tailored malpractice and business insurance for ketamine practitioners
* Resources to streamline operations, lower overhead costs, and stay compliant

​​There's zero obligation or cost. HHA will reach out when they have opportunities available for you, and you can decide to participate at your convenience. Their primary goal is to build a network to leverage the power of the ketamine industry.

“Healing Health Alliance gives clinics the leverage and operational backbone to thrive, while Ketamine Lead Gen and HealingMaps bring the demand,” said Cory Jones, Founder, Healing Health Alliance. “It’s a complete, clinic-first solution.”
