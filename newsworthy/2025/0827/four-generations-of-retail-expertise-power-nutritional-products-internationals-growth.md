# Four Generations of Retail Expertise Power Nutritional Products International’s Growth

Boca Raton, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Aug 27, 2025 @ 9:40 AM US/Eastern — Nutritional Products International (NPI), a leading global brand management and retail distribution firm, is built on a rare foundation: four generations of retail expertise passed down through the Gould family.

Scott Gould, Executive Vice President of Business Development at NPI, is the fourth generation to carry forward the family’s retail legacy. His great-grandfather, Saul Marks, began selling and manufacturing retail products in Brooklyn, NY. Scott’s grandfather, Jerry Gould, continued that business, extending the family’s influence in retail and manufacturing.

While those ventures were not directly connected to NPI, they established a family lineage rooted in retail innovation. Mitch Gould, Jerry’s son, entered the retail industry himself in 1986 and later founded Nutritional Products International in 2007. Since then, Mitch has created the “Evolution of Distribution” platform — a one-stop solution that streamlines compliance, logistics, sales, and marketing for international brands entering the U.S.

“From my grandfather Saul, who began in business and manufacturing in Brooklyn, to my father Jerry, who continued in distribution and retail, our family has always been immersed in building products and bringing them to market,” said Mitch Gould, Founder and CEO of NPI. “Today, Scott carries that same entrepreneurial spirit forward at NPI.”Building on that family legacy, Mitch Gould went on to represent some of the world’s most recognized brands. His portfolio includes Igloo, Rubbermaid, Sunbeam, and Miracle-Gro, as well as celebrity lines like Steven Seagal’s Lightning Bolt, Hulk Hogan’s Hogan Nutrition, and Chuck Liddell’s Iceman RX. Gould has secured placements with major retailers such as Walmart, Costco, GNC, Amazon, CVS, Walgreens, and Home Depot, and has built national sales teams while forming strategic partnerships with athletes and public figures like Ronnie Coleman, Roberto Clemente Jr., and Tapout Nutrition.

With that foundation in place, Scott represents the next generation of Gould leadership — bringing together business development expertise and technology innovation to advance NPI’s mission. Scott has combined his passion for business development with technology, serving as both EVP of Business Development and Chief Technology Officer for NPI subsidiaries. He is currently spearheading proprietary software that matches NPI clients with potential retail partners, ensuring faster, smarter market entry.

“I am proud to carry on the Gould family tradition of building retail success stories,” said Scott Gould. “Each generation contributed something new — and today, NPI continues that lineage by fusing retail expertise with modern technology and business development to help brands grow in the world’s largest marketplace.”For more than a decade, NPI has helped international nutraceutical, dietary supplement, functional beverage, and skin-care companies enter and expand in the American market. Its proven Evolution of Distribution platform allows foreign and domestic companies to streamline every step — from FDA compliance and warehousing to retail placement, marketing, and public relations.
