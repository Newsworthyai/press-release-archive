# SCRUMMY Launches Groundbreaking AI-Powered Insights to Transform Fantasy Rugby Experience including Women's and Youth Rugby

New York, NY (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Aug 25, 2025 @ 6:00 AM Eastern — SCRUMMY, a leading name in global fantasy sports, announces the launch of its AI-driven platform, set to revolutionize rugby and transform the fan experience. The rugby-first platform elevates gameplay with proprietary data, giving users the ability to follow real-time match play, track player statistics, and access rugby data insights across youth competitions, men’s and women’s professional leagues, and global tournaments.

Timed with the Women’s Rugby World Cup (August 22 – September 27) hosted by England, SCRUMMY intends to captivate existing rugby enthusiasts but also to attract new fans by its inclusive community features, comprehensive statistics, and simple user experience, regardless of their familiarity with fantasy sports.

SCRUMMY’s vision is clear: to grow rugby at every level, ensuring women’s rugby has a strong and visible place in the sport. "We are committed to championing the women’s sports movement and expanding rugby's reach," states Kisset Chirengende, Sports Executive, Senior Advisor to Zimbabwe National Rugby, and Co-Founder of SCRUMMY. "This launch perfectly aligns with our goal to elevate the significance of women's sports and engage fans globally-be it through casual play, competitive leagues, or simply celebrating the game we all love."

Additionally, in a remarkable pilot earlier this year, SCRUMMY partnered with youth rugby leagues across South Africa and Zimbabwe where the response was overwhelming–reaching registration capacity within just 12 hours. This was further strengthened by sponsoring one of the premier international schoolboy events, Derby Day Schools Rugby Festival in Zimbabwe — underscoring SCRUMMY’s commitment to building an all-encompassing rugby platform.

Chirengende emphasizes: "Our AI-powered insights fundamentally alter the way rugby fans interact with the sport. By integrating women's rugby and fostering a community where all levels of fans can thrive, we are not just creating a game; we are ushering in a new era for rugby, where every player is celebrated, the stats tell their stories."

About SCRUMMY: SCRUMMY is the premier daily fantasy rugby platform dedicated to creating an engaging experience for rugby fans of all levels. With a focus on AI-driven insights and real match data, SCRUMMY connects fans globally from youth competition, professional leagues, and women’s rugby through innovative community features and unparalleled performance tracking. In addition to Chirengende, SCRUMMY’s co-founders include: Angus Usher, Rugby Data & Industry Expert and Data Analyst at Chelsea FC; David Mitnick, former Intellectual Property Attorney; and Thariq Kara, previously Chief Data Architect at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. SCRUMMY is committed to elevating the sport and its players, making fantasy rugby not just a game, but a way to celebrate the fast-growing rugby culture.
