Boerne, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Jul 17, 2025 @ 6:30 AM Central — Newsworthy.ai, an innovative press release newswire created by the founder of PRWeb, today announced a strategic partnership with Charity Ace, a leading fundraising partner for nonprofits. The partnership aims to equip nonprofit organizations with an affordable, effective way to share their stories, drive donor engagement, and boost visibility through targeted press release news marketing.

Together, the two companies are launching a new offering: news marketing press release packages specifically tailored to the needs of nonprofit organizations. Each package includes access to Newsworthy.ai’s AI-optimized distribution platform and Charity Ace’s nonprofit expertise, with options for hands-on support or full-service writing and distribution.

“We’re excited to partner with Charity Ace to help nonprofits break through the noise,” said [David McInnis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidmcinnis/), Founder of Newsworthy.ai. “Most nonprofits have great stories to tell but lack the tools or bandwidth to reach broader audiences. This partnership is about giving them both—the technology and the strategy.”“Our mission at Charity Ace is to help nonprofits raise more while staying focused on their cause,” said [Justin McKenzie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinmckenzie/), Chief Operating Officer for Charity Ace. “This partnership makes news marketing both accessible and impactful—whether an organization needs hands-on help or just a better way to distribute their story.”Beyond Traditional Media—A Modern Approach to News MarketingUnlike traditional press release services focused solely on media outreach, Newsworthy.ai is built for the digital-first, AI-powered world and helps extend the reach and engagement of news. The platform distributes releases across hundreds of websites—including indexing by Google News—but also transforms each release into multiple formats (blog posts, news articles, TLDRs, FAQs, Zero-click, newsletters, podcasts, and more) via its integration with NewsRamp.com. This multi-format publishing adapts content to align with how and where audiences consume information—delivering a unique content experience—evergreen, high-impact, and optimized for search engines, social platforms, and generative AI.

“Nonprofits work tirelessly to make a difference, but their stories often go unheard in today’s noisy digital world,” said [Mark M. Willaman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markwillaman/), Co-founder of Newsworthy.ai. “By transforming a single press release into multiple formats—from summaries and podcasts to social content—we help nonprofits reach supporters wherever they are, and in the way they prefer to engage. It’s about amplifying mission-driven stories in a smarter, more accessible way.”Additional features include:* Burstable.news™ SEO amplification: A Newsworthy.ai technology that converts newswire content into hyper-vertical, SEO-optimized articles on authoritative niche third-party sites.
* LLM Optimized platform & content for improved news discover in AI Chat.
* Built-in advocacy tools for automated sharing: The Newsworthy.ai news advocacy feature makes it easy for nonprofits to leverage their internal teams and outside stakeholders to get their charity news seen and engaged with by more people — in a controlled and measurable way.
