# Maine Filmmakers Return Home with New Roadtrip Comedy-Drama "Childish Things"

South Portland, ME (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Jul 17, 2025 @ 2:00 PM US/Eastern — Childish Things, the latest indie feature from Maine natives Nick & Cash Cassidy, enjoyed exceptional reception from festival audiences in California and Vermont. The Vacationland Film Festival in Biddeford also selected the film to kick off its 2025 festival, naming Childish Things the opening night feature, as part of a larger upcoming run of theatrical screenings in the state.

And the Los Angeles premiere sold out in just five days.

Shot on an actual roadtrip from Maine to California, Childish Things follows a 30-year-old amateur musician who, facing pressure from his girlfriend to propose, embarks on a cross-country drive to sell his beloved blue tour bus.

For the filmmakers, who hail from South Portland and Cape Elizabeth, the production of Childish Things was a labor of love. With a four-figure budget and a three-person crew (including themselves), the Cassidy brothers defied conventional norms to bring their vision to life.

“Working with actors is my favorite part of filmmaking, and improvising all the dialogue made this process even more rewarding. Giving our cast the freedom to explore and follow their instincts is what makes the performances feel so real and alive,” says director Nick Cassidy.“The bus we shot in belongs to my buddy Tyler, our only crew member. We borrowed our sound gear and lights from the University of Southern Maine, and we cast friends and family in almost every role. This is as grassroots as moviemaking gets,” says producer Cash Cassidy.This summer, Childish Things continues its run with screenings around its home state, beginning with the Maine premiere on August 2nd at the Entertainment Cinemas in South Portland.
