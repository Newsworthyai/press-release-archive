# Healthipops Featured on National Television Show American Trends and Lifestyle

Boca Raton, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Oct 21, 2025 @ 5:00 AM Pacific — Healthipops, the award-winning family wellness brand known for creating science-backed vitamin lollipops that kids love, was recently featured on the nationally syndicated television show American Trends and Lifestyle. Hosted by Christina Pulara, the show reaches millions of households each week with segments covering the latest in health, wellness, lifestyle, and consumer trends.

During the segment, American Trends and Lifestyle introduced viewers to Healthipops’ playful yet purposeful mission: to make wellness simple, natural, and enjoyable for families everywhere. Founded by husband-and-wife team Maxi and Nick, parents of four, the brand blends gentle botanicals with essential vitamins and minerals to create delicious, effective lollipops that support everyday well-being — from easing travel discomfort to calming colds and sore throats.

“We wanted to create something our children — and other families — would actually enjoy,” said co-founder Maxi. “Healthipops combines the wisdom of nature with modern science, offering parents a trusted, feel-good way to care for their families.”Broadcast nationwide, American Trends and Lifestyle shines a spotlight on brands that bring innovation and joy to everyday living. Healthipops captivated audiences with its unique approach to family health — using pharmaceutical-grade botanical extracts like chamomile, lime flower, marshmallow root, and ginger to deliver gentle, plant-powered relief in fun, flavorful form.

The company’s Relief and Travel Range, including its popular Ear Popper Stopper lollipop, is designed to make life’s little moments — from airplane takeoffs to sniffle season — easier and more comfortable for kids and adults alike. All Healthipops products are vegan, sustainably sourced, and consciously made with natural sugars (not sugar alcohols) to support gut health and avoid unwanted side effects.

As part of its U.S. expansion, Healthipops is now available at Walmart, with more major retail placements coming soon. The brand’s growing American presence underscores its commitment to making everyday wellness both accessible and enjoyable for families nationwide.

“Being featured on American Trends and Lifestyle allows us to share our story with families across the country,” said Nick, Healthipops co-founder. “As parents, we understand how important it is to make wellness approachable and joyful — and that’s what Healthipops is all about.”To learn more about Healthipops or explore the full range of products, visit www.healthipopsusa.com.
