# Las Vegas Community Packs More Than 15,000 Shoebox Gifts for Children Worldwide

Las Vegas, NV (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Dec 3, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Pacific — In a powerful display of unity and generosity, more than 535 volunteers gathered at Remnant Ministries for Lion Wholesale’s annual Shoebox Packing Party on November 8, 2025, an event that has become an annual tradition for the church and for the children's wholesale toy company. Over the course of six hours, volunteers prepared 15,519 Operation Christmas Child shoeboxes, each filled with gifts and the message of the gospel for children around the world.

 Families, church groups, schools, and individuals from across Southern Nevada came together with purpose and joy, embodying Lion Wholesale’s mission to serve others and make a global impact. Sandy Ludwick, Co-Owner of Lion Wholesale, shared her heartfelt gratitude for the event and its volunteers. “More than fifteen thousand children are about to hear the greatest message ever told: that Jesus loves them, that they matter, that they are SEEN.”

 The day’s success was made possible through broad community support. SOS Radio helped spread the word and filled the gym with uplifting worship music. Volunteers were also treated to meals provided by local partners Cactus Jacks Outlaw Grill and Slanging Tacos, offering a welcome moment of rest and fellowship during the high-energy day.

 A fleet of packed trailers, loaded to the brim with colorful shoeboxes, departed the church that evening and began their journey to children in need around the globe.

 For those who were unable to attend this year, Lion Wholesale encourages the community to attend next year’s event. It will be another opportunity to be part of something meaningful and bring hope to children around the world.
