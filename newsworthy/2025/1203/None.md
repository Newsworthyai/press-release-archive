 Key Highlights from the Conference

 * State of the Industry & Foundational Science The conference opened with a “State of the Industry” address by Menachem Abraham, followed by a keynote from Dr. Makoto Kuroo, who discovered the Klotho gene. Their talks framed the current landscape of Klotho research, from molecular pathways to clinical translation. Klotho Conference
* New Klotho therapeutic modalities

 Carmela Abraham presented results of a Klotho-mRNA-LNP approach to increasing Klotho levels. Klotho Conference

 * Human Case Studies & Clinical Insights Petr Sramek presented compelling human case studies exploring Klotho-based therapies, shedding light on the translational journey from preclinical models to patient outcomes. Klotho Conference
* Klotho and Brain Health A dedicated panel, led by Dr. Dena Dubal and Dr. Miguel Chillon, examined emerging evidence for Klotho’s neuroprotective role including its impact on neurodegenerative disease models and its potential for gene therapy applications. Klotho Conference
* Klotho and cancerDr. Ido Wolf and Dr. Tamar Rubinek summarized their research on the potential of Klotho in malignant tumors suppression.

 Klotho Conference

 * Gene Therapy for Longevity Diseases Dr. Assumpció Bosch delivered a presentation on Klotho gene therapy for ALS, outlining preclinical progress and the roadmap for future clinical trials. Klotho Conference
* Inflammation, Aging & Klotho Inflammation-focused research was a major topic: Dr. Iliya Lefterov and Dr. Radosveta Koldamova discussed how Klotho signaling intersects with inflammatory pathways and its implications for chronic disease and aging. Klotho Conference

* Thought Leadership on Healthspan Dr. Joseph Cleaver gave a luncheon keynote on lifestyle, aging, and Klotho — synthesizing scientific insight with practical takehome messages for wellness practitioners. Klotho Conference

 Short summary of klotho research:

 * 4390 papers have been published on klotho since 1997.
* Clear conclusion if you are low in circulating klotho you are likely aging more rapdily than you should.
* Low klotho seems to increase cancer risk.
* Low klotho leads to earlier decline in cognition and memory and higher liklihood of brain disorders.
* Low klotho leads to higher risk of heart failure and kidney failure.
* Low klotho precipitates higher levels of calcification and inflammation.
* Low klotho leads to muscle atrophy and sarcopenia.
* Low klotho may contibute to depression, anxiety and addictions.
* Low klotho inihibits sexual health.
* Low klotho is a major underlying cause of joint osteoarthritis.
* Low klotho increases liklihood of epileptic seizures in those under 65.
* Low klotho leads to earlier aging related hair loss.
* Low klotho leads to higher levels of skin damage and wrinkles.
* Low klotho leads to earlier age related vision deterioration.
* Low klotho leads to earlier age related hearing loss.
* Low klotho leads to higher risk of osteoporosis and other bone strength loss disorders.
* Low klotho leads to higher oxidative stress.
* Low klotho leads mitochondrial dysfunction.
* Low klotho leads to higher susceptibility to infections.
* Low klotho leads to slower wound healing.
* Low klotho leads to accelerated telomere shortening and epigenetic age acceleration.
* Low klotho reduces healthspan and longevity.
* Studies are underway to prove out that higher klotho levels can reverse the above low klotho findings.

 Conference Impact and Outcomes

 * Attendees engaged in interactive Q&A sessions and roundtables to build collaborative pathways for Klotho research and commercialization.

 * Several research groups indicated plans to accelerate clinical development of Klotho-based gene therapies.

 * The conference catalyzed new partnerships, including academic institutions, biotech companies, and longevity-focused investor networks.

 * It reinforced the unified mission: raising Klotho biology into mainstream medical and therapeutic strategy to promote healthy aging.

 Looking Forward

 The success of this first Klotho Conference sets the stage for annual gatherings to follow. Organizers announced that future conferences will expand to include translational clinical trials, diagnostics development, and policy frameworks to bring Klotho therapies to patients responsibly and equitably.
