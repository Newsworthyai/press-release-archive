# Newsworthy.ai Launches NewsCrafters.com to Bridge Paid PR and Earned Media

Boerne, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Dec 3, 2025 @ 2:45 PM Central — Newsworthy.ai, a leading AI-driven press release distribution and news marketing platform, today announced the public launch of NewsCrafters.com. Created by Newsworthy.ai founder and online PR pioneer David McInnis (founder of PRWeb), NewsCrafters bridges the gap between paid press release distribution and earned media by enabling users to curate existing news into unique, authoritative content that enhances organic search visibility and strengthens brand authority.

 NewsCrafters is built on a “human-in-the-middle” model. The platform uses advanced AI to generate first drafts based on user-defined personas and tones—such as Humanistic, Analytical, or Competitive—while human curators refine, personalize, and inject real expertise before publishing. This hybrid approach ensures credibility, alignment with Google’s E-E-A-T guidelines, and content authenticity that pure AI cannot deliver.

 “We created NewsCrafters to connect the paid world of press releases to the organic power of curated content,” said David McInnis, founder of Newsworthy.ai and PRWeb. “When you combine AI efficiency with human insight, the results are immediate. Even before the official launch, curated articles have begun earning strong search visibility, appearing alongside major news outlets. NewsCrafters extends the Newsworthy.ai mission—to make every piece of news a long-term, high-value digital asset.”

 Early Results from the Private Beta During a private beta, early adopters tested the platform’s ability to expand brand reach and improve organic visibility. One participating team, led by Justin McKenzie, host of The Building Texas Show, focused on curating news during the beta period.

 Key results include:

 * High Output Efficiency: One beta team curated 343 articles.
* Significant Traffic: These articles generated nearly 14,500 page views.
* Low Time Requirement: Results were achieved with a workflow of ~15 minutes per day per user, producing 4–5 curated articles daily.
* Strong Search Visibility: Curated articles frequently earned high placements in search results, often appearing on Page 1 for targeted queries.

 “It’s been fascinating to watch the progression,” said Justin McKenzie. “We’ve been able to leverage the AI to write in specific voices, and the results speak for themselves. Curating just four or five articles a day churns the flywheel of success and builds substantial brand exposure quickly.”

 A Strategic Expansion of the Newsworthy.ai Ecosystem “NewsCrafters fits perfectly into our mission at Newsworthy.ai—to turn every press release into a long-term content asset that drives discoverability, engagement, and brand authority," said Mark M. Willaman, Co-founder of Newsworthy.ai. "By blending human curation with AI, we’re giving organizations a powerful new way to extend their voice, participate in industry conversations, and build lasting topic authority.”

 Features and Pricing NewsCrafters allows users to source content from more than a dozen press release newswires, giving access to hundreds of thousands of stories beyond the Newsworthy.ai network. By encouraging curators to stick to specific vertical topics, the platform helps users build topic authority and strengthen E-E-A-T signals.

 * Free Tier: One author persona and full access to curation tools.
* Paid Tier ($12/month): Up to three author personas, auto-approval workflows for trusted curators, and coverage of AI API costs.
* Agency Console: Designed for firms with multiple clients, personas, and brand voices.

 “This is about giving anyone—from startup founders to nonprofit leaders—the ability to extend their brand voice and influence industry conversations,” McInnis added. “Whether using the free tier or the paid tier, NewsCrafters makes professional-grade content curation a high-reward, background task.”
