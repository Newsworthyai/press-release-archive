# Humantelligence Unveils Ask Aura™: The Next Evolution in AI-Powered Workplace Coaching for Leaders, Managers & Teams

Miami, FL (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday May 6, 2025 @ 7:00 AM UTC — Humantelligence, a leading provider of AI workplace solutions, announced the launch of its newest innovation, Ask Aura™—a breakthrough in personalized, real-time workplace coaching designed to help organizations unlock the full potential of their teams and foster stronger collaboration, leadership, engagement and productivity.

Ask Aura combines the power of psychometric science with generative AI to provide employees with instant, context-aware guidance on leadership, communication and team dynamics—right within the flow of work. The AI coaching agent becomes especially relevant as companies adopt Microsoft Copilot. Ask Aura complements the tool, taking Copilot insights to the next level with more personalized GenAI insights for individuals and teams. Whether it's understanding how to motivate a teammate, navigate interpersonal conflict, or adapt to a new role, Ask Aura delivers smart, empathetic, and tailored advice in real time.

With top organizations, such as Accenture, Coca-Cola, HSBC Bank, EY, Honeywell and Cigna, piloting the solution, and industry leaders like BASF, AFLAC, Bank of the West and Ashley Furniture already leveraging Humantelligence’s platform, Ask Aura is poised to redefine how companies approach leadership development and employee engagement. This is especially critical as global employee engagement drops to its lowest levels in years.

Gallup’s 2025 State of the Global Workplace report reveals that manager engagement has declined more than any other job category—dropping from 30% to 27%—while manager effectiveness has also plunged. With 70% of employee engagement tied directly to managers, this engagement crisis threatens the productivity and performance of entire organizations. Ask Aura addresses this head on, delivering real-time, personalized coaching and collaboration guidance—right where teams work.

“We built Ask Aura for the modern workforce—where managers and their teams are stretched thin and employees crave more meaningful connection and direction,” said Kara Kaplan, Chief Commercial Officer of Humantelligence. “It’s time to equip every manager with smart, scalable support. Ask Aura is their always-on, AI-powered coach—guiding communication, engagement and leadership moments directly in the flow of work, before bottlenecks or interpersonal conflict become problems.”Ask Aura Key Features:* Instant, 24/7 guidance for managing team dynamics, communication, feedback, conflict resolution and onboarding

"Ask Aura is the first talent management AI agent that enhances, not replaces, people—making work more human. Designed to increase emotional intelligence and deepen human connections, the tool empowers leaders and employees alike with real-time coaching and development. Always on and accessible 24/7, it strengthens leadership skills, improves team dynamics and fosters meaningful engagement across your entire workforce—employee by employee.
