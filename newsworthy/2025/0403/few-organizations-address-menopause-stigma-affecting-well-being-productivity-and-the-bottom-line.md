# Few Organizations Address Menopause Stigma, Affecting Well-Being, Productivity, and the Bottom Line

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Apr 3, 2025 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — Although most HR professionals are aware that perimenopause and menopause symptoms affect the careers of many women in the workplace, few believe their organizations actively work to address the stigma surrounding these issues.Just 22% of HR professionals believe their organizations actively work to reduce this stigma for all employees, including those experiencing perimenopause/menopause. The newly released report, Understanding the Health Issues of Women in Midlife, by Aimed Alliance and HR.com’s HR Research Institute, reveals this lack of support may be leading to significant career repercussions for women in midlife, with menopause-related symptoms contributing to absenteeism, reduced productivity, and even early workforce departure.

The study indicates that 81% of respondents recognize the impact of menopause symptoms on women’s careers, citing consequences such as:

* Loss of self-confidence (85%)
* Presenteeism—working while unwell (68%)
* Loss of engagement (67%)

Yet, workplace culture remains largely unsupportive. Only 41% of respondents say their organizations actively foster a positive and healthy work environment, and a concerning 10% believe discussing menopause or health issues at work is unprofessional. As a result, 61% report that women feel uncomfortable raising concerns about treatment coverage for age-related health issues.

“Organizations must break the silence surrounding midlife health and create workplaces where employees feel supported,” said Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator and CEO of HR.com. “Ignoring these issues not only impacts individual well-being but also hinders productivity, engagement, and retention.”

The research identifies key accommodations that can help organizations foster a menopause-friendly workplace, including:

* Time off for medical appointments (88%)
* Consistent access to restrooms (86%)
* Employee assistance programs (EAPs) (80%)

The research report, Understanding the Health Issues of Women in Midlife, is available for free download and offers a detailed look at critical trends and strategies to help employers prepare for the future of HR.
