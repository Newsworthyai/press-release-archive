Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Jan 21, 2025 @ 7:00 AM America/Toronto — HR.com, the largest network of human resources (HR) professionals, has appointed Brent Skinner as its executive community leader for the Future of Payroll and Workforce Management (WFM). In this role, Skinner will act as HR.com’s industry analyst covering payroll, human resources information system (HRIS) and WFM. An accomplished subject matter expert in human capital management (HCM), Skinner will lead efforts to enhance HR expertise, resources, and strategies, empowering the HR community to optimize Payroll practices and prepare for the future of work. He has also joined HR.com's Future of Payroll advisory board to actively work with thought leaders to establish standards, relevant research topics, common metrics, and education as required.

Skinner’s vision for the role is to create a dynamic place where payroll professionals can connect, collaborate, and share knowledge. The idea is to identify industry challenges, develop solutions, and drive innovation in payroll practices, empowering these practitioners to excel in their roles and advance the profession as a whole. He also aims to help foster further camaraderie among payroll and HR professionals and develop resources for CHROs and other HR leaders to optimize their proficiency in payroll.

“Brent’s expertise will empower us to strategically support HR leaders in navigating payroll solutions and capabilities while guiding global payroll providers in creating more effective and innovative products,” stated Debbie McGrath, CEO of HR.com. “His leadership in this critical area reinforces HR.com’s commitment to driving progress and delivering value to the HR and payroll communities.”

Skinner’s background includes podcasting, public speaking, vendor analysis and research, and a broad cross-section of content development, all drawing on his extensive understanding of the competitive landscape in HCM, as well as this marketplace’s overall makeup. Over the span of his nearly 20-year career in HCM, Brent Skinner has helped executives with their thought leadership, partnered with sales, marketing, and customer success, and seen his commentary published often in the trade press. Most recently founder and principal of Open Window Strategies LLC, Skinner earlier led the industry analyst practice covering HCM for 3Sixty Insights, a research firm that he helped co-found. The former technology editor for HRO Today, he was previously an industry analyst at Nucleus Research, leading the HCM practice there.
