# Denton Defines Its Own Path as North Texas Grows

Denton, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Dec 31, 2025 @ 9:15 AM US/Central — Mayor Gerard Hudspeth on Culture, Workforce, and the Long View of City Building As growth across the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex accelerates, the City of Denton is doing something increasingly rare: growing with intention. In a new episode of The Building Texas Show, host Justin McKenzie sits down with Gerard Hudspeth to explore how long-term planning, cultural investment, and regional collaboration are shaping Denton’s future—without losing what makes the city distinct.

 Born and raised in Denton, Mayor Hudspeth brings both personal history and institutional memory to the role. First elected to city council in 2017 and later elected mayor in 2020, his leadership tenure has spanned a period marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, Winter Storm Uri, rapid population growth, and shifting economic dynamics across North Texas. Through it all, Hudspeth emphasizes continuity over disruption, viewing city leadership as a relay rather than a reset.

 “Cities don’t change overnight,” Hudspeth explains. “You pick up where your predecessors left off, stand on their shoulders, and keep moving the vision forward.”

 Planning for Growth Without Losing Identity Central to Denton’s approach is a commitment to long-range planning—balancing growth with livability. As home to major higher-education institutions including the University of North Texas and Texas Woman’s University, Denton attracts students from across the state and beyond. The challenge, Hudspeth notes, is ensuring those graduates can stay, work, and build lives locally.

 That means focusing on job creation across logistics, advanced manufacturing, engineering, data infrastructure, and emerging technologies. Major employers such as Peterbilt and Tetra Pak anchor the industrial base, while recent investments in high-speed computing infrastructure signal Denton’s role in the next phase of digital and AI-driven industry. At the same time, city leaders are actively working to attract higher-wage corporate and financial employers to broaden opportunity.

 “We want someone to graduate here, find a meaningful job, buy a home, and raise a family—without having to leave the city they love,” Hudspeth says.

 Culture as Economic Infrastructure Denton’s identity is inseparable from its culture, and the city has leaned into that reality as an economic strategy. From world-class music programs to a nationally recognized arts scene, Denton’s cultural ecosystem delivers both quality of life and measurable economic impact.

 One standout example is the city’s now-signature “31 Days of Halloween” celebration, which brought more than 830,000 visitors downtown over a single month. The result: packed streets, thriving small businesses, and tangible returns for local entrepreneurs—proof that coordinated civic effort can turn culture into commerce.

 “That’s the visitor center, the chamber, economic development, and local businesses all pulling in the same direction,” McKenzie notes during the conversation. “That kind of alignment doesn’t happen by accident.”

 Building for 2026 and Beyond Looking ahead, Hudspeth highlights the Landmark Development—a 3,200-acre master-planned community in partnership with Hillwood—as a major milestone for Denton’s next chapter. The project blends residential, retail, trails, and open space, anchored by H-E-B, and reflects years of planning around housing mix, workforce needs, and long-term sustainability.

 With more than 1,000 acres dedicated to trails and outdoor amenities, the development represents Denton’s effort to grow thoughtfully while enhancing everyday life for residents.

 “It’s about filling in gaps, not just adding rooftops,” Hudspeth says. “Growth should make the city better, not just bigger.”

 Civic Leadership as Service Throughout the conversation, Hudspeth underscores a key reality often misunderstood by the public: municipal leadership is a service role built on collaboration. Mayors and council members work alongside professional city managers and staff, focusing on problem-solving, responsiveness, and community trust rather than unilateral control.

 “Just because you can win an election doesn’t mean you can run a city,” Hudspeth reflects. “That’s why strong partnerships and professional staff matter so much.”

 Discover Denton For those interested in visiting, investing, or learning more, Hudspeth points audiences to Discover Denton, the city’s central hub for events, economic development resources, and community engagement.

 As McKenzie concludes in the episode, Denton offers a compelling case study for Texas cities navigating rapid change—proving that growth, culture, and long-term vision don’t have to be in conflict.
