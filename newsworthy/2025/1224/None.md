# Pampa, Texas Positions Itself at the Center of America’s Next Energy and Data Boom

Pampa, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Dec 24, 2025 @ 10:00 AM US/Central — In a new episode of The Building Texas Show, host Justin McKenzie sits down with Mike Borger, Mayor of Pampa, Texas to explore how a legacy Panhandle community is emerging as one of Texas’ most unexpected growth stories heading into 2025 and beyond.

 Long known for agriculture, oil, and gas, Pampa is now leveraging its natural assets—abundant wind, sunshine, land, and midstream energy infrastructure—to attract data centers, renewable energy projects, and advanced manufacturing. Mayor Borger describes a convergence of forces that is reshaping the city’s economic future, positioning Pampa not as a community catching up, but one moving onto the leading edge of national trends in power generation and digital infrastructure.

 During the conversation, Borger outlines why Pampa is uniquely suited for data-center development, citing grid resilience, renewable energy generation, and proximity to critical gas pipeline networks. He also addresses common misconceptions around water usage and infrastructure strain, emphasizing that modern facilities are designed with cooling technologies that respect regional constraints.

 Beyond industry attraction, the discussion highlights Pampa’s investment in people. A $130 million school improvement initiative is underway, including new facilities and career-technology education designed to keep graduates in the community with access to high-paying, future-ready careers. For Borger, reversing decades of out-migration is central to Pampa’s long-term stability.

 Quality of life is another pillar of the city’s strategy. From regional events and festivals to historic music venues tied to Woody Guthrie, Pampa continues to draw visitors from across the Panhandle and beyond. The city’s role as a regional hub—what Borger refers to as the “Pampaplex”—supports retail, tourism, and civic life for a population far larger than its borders suggest.

 Borger also reflects on leadership lessons learned since taking office in June, emphasizing the importance of unity across city, county, economic development, and chamber organizations. According to the mayor, alignment and optimism have been just as critical as capital investment in driving momentum.

 The episode underscores a broader theme at the heart of The Building Texas Show: the future of Texas is not limited to its largest metros. Communities like Pampa are demonstrating how legacy towns can evolve, attract modern industry, and create new opportunities without losing their identity.

 The full interview with Mayor Mike Borger is available now on YouTube as part of The Building Texas Show, a statewide series highlighting the leaders, ideas, and investments shaping Texas’ next chapter.
