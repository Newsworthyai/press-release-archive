# New Research Uncovers Secrets to Scaling Hiring Without Sacrificing Quality

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Jul 24, 2025 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — Organizations that excel in high-volume hiring share a common approach: a well-defined strategy, backed by effective technology use and continuous metric tracking.

For example, such organizations are:

* 4X more likely to find AI tools effective
* 3X more likely to link hiring metrics to on-the-job performance

The HR Research Institute’s latest research study, HR.com's State of Seasonal, Hourly and Volume Hiring 2025, also reveals that companies that excel at high-volume recruitment are hiring quickly and at scale—without sacrificing quality.

The research provides timely insights for HR professionals navigating growing hiring demands, especially in industries reliant on large hourly or contract workforces. With clearly defined goals, the right tech stack, and data-driven practices, high-volume hiring can become a true competitive advantage.

The top high-volume recruiting metrics cited by respondents include quality of hire (61%), conversion rate (47%), time to hire or fill (46%), and retention rate (44%). These findings highlight that measuring what matters most—how well hires perform, how efficiently candidates move through the funnel, and how long they stay—is key to long-term hiring success.

Modern high-volume recruiting also tends to rely heavily on technology. The most effective tools, according to the study, include:

* Applicant tracking systems (ATS) – 51%
* Artificial intelligence (e.g., chatbots, SMS automation) – 51%
* Virtual job previews or simulations – 45%
* Employee referral tracking tools – 44%

This data confirms that automation and personalization—when used together—help recruiters manage scale while enhancing the candidate experience.

Despite progress, many HR teams still struggle with:

* High turnover and churn
* Poor candidate-job fit
* Manual processing of overwhelming application volumes

The study emphasizes that solving these problems requires not just better tools—but better strategy.

“High-volume hiring success hinges on the right data and the right tools,” said Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator and CEO of HR.com. “This research shows that when HR professionals prioritize performance-linked metrics and embrace technology like AI and ATS platforms, they dramatically improve both hiring quality and efficiency.”REPORT DOWNLOAD
