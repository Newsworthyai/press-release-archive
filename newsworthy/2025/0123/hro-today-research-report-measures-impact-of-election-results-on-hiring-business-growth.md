# HRO Today Research Report Measures Impact of Election Results on Hiring, Business Growth

Philadelphia, PA (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Jan 23, 2025 @ 8:30 AM Eastern — SharedXpertise Media, publishers of HRO Today magazine and HRO Today Global, producers of the Baker’s Dozen Customer Satisfaction Ratings, and organizers of the HRO Today Forums and Educational Events, have released a new research report coinciding with the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as the 47th president of the United States, Election Results Unlikely To Impact Hiring or Business Growth: Workforce Plans Steady Awaiting Market Improvement.

This HRO Today Research Flash Report, sponsored by Sevenstep, a KellyOCG company, posits that election results can significantly influence organizations’ hiring strategies, largely due to shifts in policy and economic conditions that follow changes in government leadership. Election outcomes often determine government priorities in areas like healthcare, energy, immigration, and taxes. Election seasons often bring economic uncertainty, which can affect consumer confidence and investment. Businesses may adopt cautious hiring approaches, slowing expansions or freezing new positions.

Study participants were asked to gauge the impact of the U.S. Presidential election outcome on their organizations’ plans to grow their business over the next 12 months. To show the impact or lack thereof that the most recent election has had on business planning or operations in the short term, study participant responses are segmented by respondents who most identify with the Democratic or Republican political parties or consider themselves independent.

“Organizations are very much in a ‘wait and see mode’ with respect to hiring,” says the author of the report, HRO Today SVP of Research [Larry Basinait](https://www.linkedin.com/in/larry-basinait-2731265/). “The outcome of the changing administration did not change short-term plans for hiring.”Other questions asked of respondents included:

* What are the perceptions of HR executives on their ability to meet TA needs or their organizations’ business objectives?
* Does one’s political views impact one’s perception of confidence in one's ability to execute workforce planning and one’s organization’s ability to meet business needs?

“Sevenstep’s market intelligence and current client experience align with the findings in the report, indicating a cautious move forward in hiring, continued volatility in the market, and a tight supply of critical workers in skilled fields,” said Sevenstep Executive Vice President of Client Services [Noelle Paras](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noelleschiller/). “We have achieved great success with clients who apply our ready-for-everything talent acquisition model with a deep array of resources to navigate the hiring markets ahead.”
