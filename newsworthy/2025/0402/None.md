```html
Monterrey, NL (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Apr 2, 2025 @ 5:15 AM America/Mexico_City — 29 de marzo de 2025 — The Mexican startup Nufi, specialized in identity verification for individuals and companies, announced today the successful closing of a new seed round for $1.5 million dollars, backed by leading funds and notable figures from the technology ecosystem in Latin America.

The round was led by GPCompas and Magma Partners, and included participation from Semilla Ventures, Ganas Ventures, Techstars Follow Up Fund, and AngelHub, as well as angel investors.

“Since 2023, Nufi has been profitable. But this additional round allows us to accelerate what we have already been building: cutting-edge technology to validate individuals and companies in less than 5 minutes,” commented Hans Villa, CEO and co-founder of Nufi.“We will expand our national coverage, improve our document processing products and company registrations, and continue building a more secure, fast, and reliable digital identity for all of Mexico.”

This announcement comes at a time when investment in venture capital in Mexico fell by more than 90% in January, according to TTR Data. Amid this contraction, Nufi's case stands out as a sign of hope: it is possible to raise capital when executed with focus and results.While many startups face barriers, Nufi demonstrates that solving a real problem with already functioning technology remains the best calling card.

“At GPCompas, we invest in solutions with tangible impact. Nufi tackles a challenge faced by many industries, and it does so with proven technology. Even our partner companies have integrated their solution.”— Braulio Arsuaga, GPCompas

With more than 330 B2B clients, Nufi enables banks, fintechs, insurance companies, proptechs, and HR companies to verify real identities, validate official documents, and prevent fraud in seconds, all powered by artificial intelligence. Its vision: to make verifying an identity in Latin America as easy and secure as possible.
