# LeafWire & Newsworthy.ai Team Up to Expand Cannabis Industry Press Release Reach & Engagement

Denver, CO (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Apr 2, 2025 @ 1:00 PM US/Eastern — Leafwire, the largest business network in the cannabis industry, has partnered with Newsworthy.ai, an AI-driven press release newswire platform, to offer enhanced press release distribution and visibility for LeafWire members. This collaboration enables news announcements posted on LeafWire.com to benefit from additional amplification via Newsworthy.ai’s press release newswire distribution network of 400+ media sites, which includes hundreds of websites and newsrooms.

Moreover, these announcements gain further reach through NewsRamp.com, a proprietary content curation and distribution platform that transforms press releases into multiple content formats—including articles, blog posts, TLDRs, video, and Zero-Click Marketing formats. NewsRamp also translates press releases into up to 12 languages and syndicates them across social media, forums, newsletters, podcasts, and news sites, significantly boosting online visibility and engagement.

"We are thrilled at the opportunity to help LeafWire and their customers maximize the visibility of their news announcements," said [Mark M. Willaman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markwillaman/), founder of Newsworthy.ai. "Most internet activity happens outside of search, so it is essential for press releases to be present on alternative platforms. Newsworthy.ai and NewsRamp ensure that their news surfaces organically across media sites, search engines, social, and other platforms where audiences spend their time."Mike Ballard, Vice President of Sales & Marketing at LeafWire Media said of the new partnership: “The cannabis industry presents certain problems, limitations and biases when it comes to advertising and promotion. We are constantly searching for new, efficient ways to help our advertisers expand their reach, and Newsworthy.ai provided a technically sophisticated, affordable option to achieve a significant bump in media coverage.”The landscape of press release distribution is facing unprecedented challenges. From evolving SEO algorithms to penalties for duplicate content, AI-driven search trends, and the rise of “Search and Answer,” traditional methods of reaching target audiences are shifting dramatically. This partnership between LeafWire and Newsworthy.ai ensures that cannabis industry businesses can maximize the visibility of their news where their target audiences are actively engaging.
