# From Hill Country to World Stage: Andalusia Whiskey Co. Wins World’s Best Small Batch Single Malt at 2025 World Whiskies Awards

Blanco, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Apr 2, 2025 @ 6:00 AM Central — What began as a shared dream between two friends in the heart of the Texas Hill Country has just earned global recognition. Andalusia Whiskey Co., a grain-to-glass distillery nestled in Blanco, has been awarded World’s Best Small Batch Single Malt at the 2025 World Whiskies Awards for their Stryker Single Malt finished in Madeira casks.

This is more than a win. It’s a moment. A moment that places Texas—and the rapidly rising American Single Malt category—firmly on the world stage.

The Stryker expression, known for its rich smoked malt and bold Texas character, took on new depth after finishing in Madeira casks from Texas’ own Haak Winery. The result? A layered and complex whiskey that bridges regional terroir with global influence—earning nods from judges across continents.

The victory comes at a pivotal time, as the American Single Malt category continues to define itself and gain formal recognition within the global whiskey world. Once considered a niche, American Single Malt is now a movement—and Texas is at its fiery heart.

“For a Texas distillery to be named the best in the world in this category—especially as American Single Malt steps into the international spotlight—is huge,” said Ty Phelps, Co-Founder and Head Distiller. “This win is not just for us. It’s for every Texas distillery proving that excellence doesn’t come from tradition alone—it comes from innovation, passion, and a sense of place.” From the very beginning, Andalusia Whiskey Co. has committed to a grain-to-glass philosophy of distilling on-site, and aging under the wide Texas sky. What began as a humble operation in the Hill Country has become a beacon of American craft distilling.

“This award validates everything we’ve been working toward,” said Tommy Erwin, Co-Founder and Director of Operations. “It means our vision, our process, and our belief in Texas-grown, Texas-made whiskey is resonating beyond state lines. We’re honored, humbled, and more inspired than ever.” As the world turns its eyes toward the evolution of American Single Malt, this moment marks a milestone—for Andalusia Whiskey Co., for Texas, and for a new chapter in American whiskey.
