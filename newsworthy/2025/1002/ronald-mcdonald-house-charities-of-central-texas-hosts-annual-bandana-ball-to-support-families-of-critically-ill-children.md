# Ronald McDonald House Charities of Central Texas Hosts Annual Bandana Ball to Support Families of Critically Ill Children

Austin, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Oct 2, 2025 @ 10:36 AM Pacific — Ronald McDonald House Charities of Central Texas (RMHC CTX) hosts its annual Bandana Ball on Thursday, October 2, 2025, at the Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum. This signature fundraising event unites the Central Texas community to support programs that improve the health and well-being of children and families facing serious illness.

RMHC CTX’s mission is simple yet impactful: to create, find, and support programs that directly enhance the lives of children and families. Through its Ronald McDonald House and Ronald McDonald Family Rooms, the organization provides a comforting home-away-from-home for families with children receiving medical care, ensuring they can stay together during challenging times.

This year marks the sixth consecutive collaboration with the Cowboy Auctioneer team, whose high-energy live auction and donation appeal will help raise vital funds to keep families close when they need it most.

“Thirty years ago, the Ronald McDonald House supported me and my family while we went through the toughest thing any of us would ever go through. Their team and resources were such a blessing while we had children at home and a child in the hospital," said John Lucius, Cowboy Ringman for whom the mission is deeply personal. "It’s an honor to be a part of Team Cowboy Auctioneer, fundraising for this incredible mission decades later while they support other courageous families navigating a child’s illness.”The Bandana Ball offers a memorable evening of dining, dancing, and giving back, all in the spirit of strengthening families during life’s most difficult moments.
