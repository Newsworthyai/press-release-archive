# Raise a Glass for Hope: Healing House's Martini Tour Unites Community in Support of Grieving Families

Lafayette, Louisiana (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Jul 29, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Central â€” Healing House, a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing resources and support to grieving children and their families in Louisiana's Acadiana community, is hosting its annual Martini Tour and Gala, a signature fundraising event that showcases incredible martini creations from local businesses.

The Martini Tour, a popular event running from June to August, features innovative martini concoctions from eight local establishments. The competition provides a unique platform for businesses to showcase their mixology skills while supporting a noble cause. The culmination of the Martini Tour leads to the highly anticipated annual gala, scheduled this year for August 16th, where attendees can enjoy an evening of entertainment and fundraising.

Cowboy Auctioneer, a strategic fundraising partner, and the auctioneer for Healing House since 2021, continues to play a significant role in raising funds to support the organization's mission. Heath Hale, Founder, President & Auctioneer of Cowboy Auctioneer, expressed his heartfelt support for Healing House and the vital role it plays in the community. He stated, "There are certain missions that we wish there wasn't a need for but we're so glad that they exist. Healing House supports children in one of their most vulnerable states - after they've lost a loved one. It's such an honor to support these courageous children with the incredibly generous Lafayette community each year. It's inspiring to know that when the unthinkable happens for children, there's a safe place like Healing House for them to find comfort in."

The Martini Tour & Gala not only raises essential funds for Healing House but also raises awareness about the vital support the organization provides to children facing the loss of a loved one. Proceeds from the event help Healing House continue its mission of offering grief support services, counseling, and educational programs to children and families in need.

With the support of the community and dedicated partners like Cowboy Auctioneer, Healing House makes a meaningful difference in the lives of those experiencing loss. The Martini Tour and Gala serve as a beacon of hope and healing for the grieving children and families in the Acadiana community.
