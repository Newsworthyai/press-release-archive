Inspired by her experience, and alongside Rhyno, she set out to craft a delicious, sessionable beverage that could serve as an enticing alternative to a glass of wine or beer at the end of the day.

Each Pharos beverage contains 5 mg of hemp-derived THC, offering a balanced, approachable experience ideal for canna-curious adults, older consumers, and those preferring a mild, sessionable buzz.
