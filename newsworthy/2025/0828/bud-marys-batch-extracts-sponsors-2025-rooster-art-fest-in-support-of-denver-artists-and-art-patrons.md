# Bud &amp; Mary’s Batch Extracts Sponsors 2025 Rooster Art Fest in Support of Denver Artists and Art Patrons

Denver, Colorado (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Aug 28, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Mountain — Batch, the acclaimed extracts brand of Bud & Mary’s, is bringing the inspiration to the 2025 Rooster Art Fest, sponsoring a pair of live art demonstrations from Denver artists Joe Palec and Patrick Kane McGregor during the annual event at ReelWorks Denver on Sat., Sept. 6.

In collaboration with Blazy Susan, Batch is providing a YETI Tundra 350 Hard Cooler, which Palec will adorn with his distinctively whimsical black-and-white drawings valued at $4,200. In addition, muralist Patrick Kane McGregor will create one of his signature dog paintings, featuring the dog of Bud & Mary’s Founder Chris Nelson, a beloved Husky and family member, as his model. Both artworks will be created live on site throughout the event. Palec’s cooler creation will be available to one lucky guest through a raffle at the close of the show.

“One of the most beautiful aspects of creating art is that inspiration can come from nearly anything or anyone,” Nelson said. “Even something as ordinary as a cooler can become something unique, as Joe will help us discover at the Rooster Art Fest. And although I already think of my dog as being unique, it will be exciting to see how Patrick captures that quality. This type of communal art experience helps us connect with our customers and friends in new ways, which is also one of our goals at Bud & Mary’s.”The Rooster Art Fest is Denver’s premier street and urban art festival, featuring more than 50 top-tier local and national artists, live murals, art battles, immersive installations, live music, delicious food trucks, and a massive art market. The event will also feature three music stages: bass stage, hip hop stage and a singer/songwriter stage. For more information and to buy tickets, visit the Rooster Arts Fest website.
