# Psylutions Applauds DEA Milestone on Path to Psilocybin Rescheduling

Denver, Colorado (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Aug 27, 2025 @ 7:15 PM Mountain — Psylutions, Colorado's first licensed regulated cultivator and manufacturer of psilocybin, welcomes the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) decision to forward a petition to reschedule psilocybin to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for scientific review. The move marks a significant regulatory milestone in the decades-long effort to integrate psychedelics into mainstream medicine.

 “We commend the DEA’s decision to move the psilocybin rescheduling petition to HHS for scientific review. This crucial step reflects a long-overdue alignment between policy and science and brings healing one step closer to those who need it most,” said Rhonda DeSantis, founder of Psylutions. “At Psylutions, we’re ready to help build a future where psilocybin therapy is safe, regulated, and accessible. Our licensed cultivation, precision dosing, and partnership network are already laying that groundwork in Colorado.” If psilocybin is moved from Schedule I to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act, patients in palliative care and Veterans suffering from PTSD would be among the first to benefit through expanded pathways like Right to Try. Rescheduling would also accelerate research opportunities and expand access for clinicians and licensed healing centers.

 “This development signals a regulatory awakening. As agencies begin engaging with medical evidence over stigma, we are entering a watershed moment for psychedelics. I believe psychedelics hold even greater potential for significant medical applications than cannabis, and it is critical we approach this transition with the highest standards. Psylutions stands ready to support progress grounded in legal integrity and patient safety,” said Henry Baskerville, General Counsel and Partner at Psylutions Psylutions has invested heavily in infrastructure to meet the highest standards of safety and precision, including strain optimization, lab-verified dosing, and triple HEPA filtration systems to mitigate contamination risk. The company already partners with over 50% of healing centers operating across Colorado to provide regulated psilocybin solutions for chronic pain, trauma relief, end-of-life care, and broader mental wellness.

 “As soon as psilocybin is rescheduled from Schedule I, patients facing terminal illness and Veterans at risk of suicide will finally have safe, legal access through Right to Try,” DeSantis added. “Psylutions is committed to making sure that access is built on medicine that is effective, rigorously verified, and responsibly produced.” For more information or to schedule an interview, contact Shawna Seldon McGregor at 917-971-7852 or shawna@themaverickpr.com.
