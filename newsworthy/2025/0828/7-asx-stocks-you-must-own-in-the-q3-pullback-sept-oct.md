But not all stocks sink—some defend and even surge.

Below, we outline the seasonal context, the sector lens, and seven stocks our team highlight as potential winners during the dip.

September–October often pulls backThe All-Ordinaries Index has rallied hard and is well overdue for a correction. History has shown that a surge over 25% with no meaningful selling is often the cap, resulting in a pullback shortly after. Since April, the market has run over 26% so it is sitting right in the range for a turnaround.

Seasonality and stretched runs often precede a pause or pullback into September and sometimes early October, before strength re-emerges toward November.

Key idea: Expect volatility, not necessarily a crash. Stock selection, timing and risk management matter most in this window.

The sector lens, and why stock selection winsFinancials and select consumer names often hold up, while miners can be the swing factor. Our approach is stock-specific seasonality supported by technical confirmation, not blanket sector bets.

7 stocks to watch in the Q3 pullbackThese stocks were discussed on the show with a focus on seasonal tendencies and current technical context.

Always wait for confirmation and manage risk.

1. TechnologyOne (ASX: TNE)Profile: Quality tech compounder with historically resilient Sept to Oct behaviour (often consolidates sideways rather than breaking down).

Setup: Sideways consolidation on the weekly chart; a breakout from consolidation can kick off the next leg.

Insert Chart

2. Qantas (ASX: QAN)Profile: Transformed post‑COVID; making new highs with a well-defined rising trend.

Level: Recent June low is your line-in-the-sand; trendline support remains key.

Insert Chart

 3. Pro Medicus (ASX: PME)Profile: Seasonality often sees September as a springboard into strong runs.

Levels: Short-term support around $300. A break of the prior all-time high (ATH) can open another momentum phase.

Insert Chart

4. HUB24 (ASX: HUB)Profile: Strong trend, but extended.

Plan: Prefer a pullback to fill the gaps around $92 before considering fresh entry.

Insert Chart

5. ANZ Group (ASX: ANZ)Profile: More defensive among majors; still below its ATH, offering upside potential.

Map: ~11% to prior ATH; above that, a pathway toward $42+ opens up.

Insert Chart

6. Xero (ASX: XRO)Profile: September can be softer, but October seasonality is strong.

Level: Watch the $155 support and trend/momentum confluence; confirmation could set a run back toward the highs.

Insert Chart

7. Aristocrat Leisure (ASX: ALL)Profile: Near ATH with constructive structure; potential to join the “$100 club.”

Plan: Embrace healthy pullbacks; post‑retest breakouts can travel well.

Trending topic: new US de minimis rules and Aussie online retailersAustralia Post has paused parcels to the US amid tariff changes that lower duty‑free thresholds.

Larger players like Amazon can absorb costs better than small Aussie e‑commerce exporters, potentially reshaping competitive dynamics.

Portfolio takeaway: review holdings with US parcel exposure and adjust risk if needed.

A rules-based playbook for September & OctoberLet seasonality inform, not dictate: combine with price action and confirmation.

Define invalidation before entry: e.g., TNE breakout failure, XRO $155, QAN June low.

Scale with volatility: smaller size for higher beta names (PME, XRO).

Respect gaps and retests: HUB pullbacks into $92; ALL retests before continuation.

Journal and review: repeatable patterns and timing edges compound over time.
