# Kendall County Judge Candidate Ricky Gleason in In-Depth Conversation on Local Leadership, Growth, and the Future of the Texas Hill Country

Kendall County, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Saturday Dec 27, 2025 @ 10:00 AM Central — Vote Like A Texan, the civic interview series focused on increasing voter awareness and participation across Texas, has released a new long-form episode featuring Ricky Gleason, a candidate for Kendall County Judge. Hosted by Justin McKenzie, the episode explores the responsibilities of county leadership, the importance of strategic planning, and the challenges facing one of the fastest-growing regions in the Texas Hill Country.

 In Texas, the County Judge serves as the chief executive officer of the county, overseeing budget priorities, emergency management, intergovernmental coordination, and the Commissioners Court. During the conversation, Gleason reflects on why he chose to seek public office and how his professional background in financial planning and business consulting informs his approach to county governance.

 Gleason describes his decision to run as a deeply personal and family-centered commitment, rooted in a long-standing desire to give back to the community that raised him. After years of consideration and prayer, he says the timing felt right to step forward and serve Kendall County during a period of rapid growth and increasing complexity.

 A central theme of the episode is the need for collaborative leadership at the county level. Gleason emphasizes that counties must work in partnership with cities, school districts, nonprofit organizations, first responders, and neighboring counties to effectively address shared challenges. He points to emergency management, wildfire preparedness, flooding, and volunteer fire departments as areas where coordination and long-term planning are essential.

 The conversation also addresses growth along the Interstate 10 corridor and throughout the Texas Triangle. Gleason rejects simplistic “pro-growth versus anti-growth” narratives, instead advocating for realistic, values-driven planning that respects private property rights while preserving the Hill Country’s heritage, water resources, and quality of life.

 Water availability and regional infrastructure emerge as critical issues, with Gleason calling for proactive collaboration among Hill Country counties. He notes that water systems, flood risks, and transportation networks do not stop at county lines, making intergovernmental cooperation essential for sustainable solutions.

 McKenzie frames the discussion around the broader civic importance of county government, highlighting how decisions made at the local level directly affect families, businesses, and future generations. Together, the two explore how a clear strategic vision can help Kendall County navigate growth while remaining a place where residents can build businesses, raise families, and preserve community character.

 As the episode concludes, Gleason underscores the importance of voter participation—particularly in primary elections—encouraging residents to engage early and make their voices heard.
