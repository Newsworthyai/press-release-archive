Fort Worth, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Sep 18, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Central — The Western Sports Foundation (WSF) is excited to announce the inaugural Western Social, a reimagined fundraising event that merges the vibrant spirit of the western lifestyle with an unforgettable evening of community, entertainment and purpose. Scheduled for Thursday, September 25, 2025, at the John Wayne: An American Experience in the Fort Worth Stockyards, this event aims to deepen connections between guests and the mission of supporting rodeo athletes.

“This event represents the next chapter for WSF,” said Mai-Brit Harvey, Interim Executive Director of Western Sports Foundation. “The Western Social blends fun and philanthropy, while giving our community a chance to see the real impact their generosity has on rodeo athletes and their families.”

Event highlights include interactive giving stations with fair-inspired games, a silent auction featuring exclusive western fashion, art, exclusive experiences and one-of-a-kind items. Attendees are encouraged to dress to impress showcasing their favorite outfits exhibiting Western Flair. Guests will be able to capture memories and iconic style moments at the Boot Barn Photo Booth.
