# Buy These Bargain ASX Stocks Before It’s Too Late

Melbourne, Australia (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Sep 19, 2025 @ 3:00 AM Australia/Melbourne — The Australian share market is booming, with investors asking: is it already too late to grab the next bargain? At Wealth Within, we know the answer is no if you understand how to identify undervalued opportunities before the crowd does.

Why Bargain Stocks MatterIn every roaring bull market, there are always overlooked or mispriced stocks hiding in plain sight. The challenge for investors is knowing which are set to take off and which may drain your portfolio.

Our experts, backed by decades of experience and featured by Bloomberg, CNBC and The Australian, recently spotlighted several ASX stocks trading at bargain levels. Here’s what we covered.

Top Tips to Spot the Next Bargain Stock1. Buy what’s not hot Look for unloved stocks that have been sold off. These often present the highest upside potential once market sentiment shifts.
2. Focus on technicals Avoid stocks in ongoing downtrends. Instead, learn to spot proven reversal and breakout patterns.
3. Approach penny stocks carefully While small-cap opportunities can return multiples, they carry higher risk. Always define your stop-loss levels and stick to them.

Examples from the MarketVR1 GroupInvolved in AI, VR and 3D modelling, VR1 has been quietly shifting momentum. After breaking its January 2025 high, price action suggests potential turnaround, making it a candidate for bargain hunters.

MAAS Group HoldingsAnalysts call it undervalued by 40–50% relative to peers, yet the chart tells the real story. After a deep correction, a breakout above recent highs could confirm significant upside.

Liberty Financial GroupIPO’d at $7.50 but trading around $3, the stock is showing early signs of bargain territory. A move above key resistance at $4.50 would signal potential for longer-term growth.

OECThis penny stock recently consolidated after a deep 44% pullback, forming a reversal setup. If managed with discipline, these patterns can deliver strong returns.

What Counts as a “Cheap” Stock?A crucial lesson: cheap doesn’t mean low priced. An 8-cent stock can be overpriced, while a $4.50 stock can be undervalued. The real question is: where is the opportunity? That’s why price, pattern and momentum matter more than price tags.

Tesla vs WiseTech – A Case Study in Market PsychologyA recent trending topic in the Hot Stock Tips videos compared Elon Musk’s billion-dollar Tesla buy with WiseTech’s CEO unloading shares worth hundreds of millions.

For traders, the lesson was clear: ignore the stories, watch the charts. Markets reward execution based on rules and not speculation on headlines.

Fear, Greed and the Role of RulesMost traders act on emotion, selling too early out of fear or buying impulsively out of greed. But consistent success isn’t about luck. Rather, it comes from structured rules for entry, exit, and risk management.

That’s exactly what our Trading courses teach: disciplined share trading education to eliminate guesswork and build confidence.
