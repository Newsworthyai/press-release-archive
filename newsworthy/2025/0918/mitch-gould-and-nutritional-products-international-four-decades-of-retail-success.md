# Mitch Gould and Nutritional Products International: Four Decades of Retail Success

Boca Raton, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Sep 18, 2025 @ 7:00 AM US/Eastern — Mitch Gould, founder and CEO of Nutritional Products International (NPI), continues to build on a retail career that has spanned more than three decades and connected him to the headquarters of nearly every major retailer in America.

From Walmart and Costco to 7-Eleven, CVS, and Home Depot, Gould has worked alongside the biggest names in retail to launch and expand brands into the U.S. market.

“I’ve sat across the table from virtually every major retail buyer in the country,” said Gould. “It’s been an incredible journey to help companies navigate distribution at the highest levels of American retail.”A Track Record of Major PartnershipsThroughout his career, Gould has represented or partnered with a long list of retailers including Walgreens, Albertsons, Vitamin Shoppe, Menards, Safeway, Meijer, Lowes, and Circle K, among others.

At the same time, his path has intersected with legendary athletes and entertainers such as Hulk Hogan, Steven Seagal, Wayne Gretzky, Chuck Liddell, Ronnie Coleman, Joe Theismann, Steve Garvey, and Roberto Clemente Jr.

“I’ve had the privilege of working with icons from both the sports and entertainment worlds,” Gould said. “Together, we brought exciting products to market and connected with consumers in ways that set new benchmarks for speed and impact.”One example: Gould partnered with actor Steven Seagal to create the Lightning Bolt Energy Drink, which reached shelves at Walmart and 7-11 nationwide in under a year—an unheard-of timeline in the beverage industry.

Building Amazon’s Sports Nutrition and Wellness CategoriesLong before Amazon became the retail powerhouse it is today, Gould played a pivotal role in expanding its health, wellness, and sports nutrition categories.

“At that time, Amazon wasn’t the giant it is now—it was still known mostly for books and electronics,” Gould recalled. “I helped place more than 150 health and nutrition brands on their platform, including category leaders like BSN, MuscleTech, Optimum Nutrition, and CytoSport. Being part of Amazon’s early expansion into wellness was both challenging and rewarding.”Full-Service Approach with InHealth MediaSupporting NPI’s retail distribution model is its sister company, InHealth Media (IHM), a marketing and communications agency founded by Gould.

“IHM specializes in high-impact visibility campaigns—national TV tagging, influencer programs, PR outreach, and digital strategies that drive awareness and consumer engagement,” Gould explained.Together, NPI and IHM provide manufacturers with a turnkey solution for launching, marketing, and sustaining their brands in the U.S.
