# Rabbu Pivots from Property Management to Nationwide Marketplace for Profitable Airbnb Investments

Charlotte, NC (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Oct 22, 2025 @ 8:00 AM US/Eastern — Rabbu, a Charlotte-based real estate technology company once known for managing short-term rental (STR) properties, has officially transformed into a nationwide STR investment marketplace that helps investors find, analyze, and finance profitable Airbnb properties—all in one place.

The pivot reduces barriers in short-term rental investing, a market historically complex and difficult for most investors.

“We built Rabbu to make short-term rental investing simple, transparent, and accessible for everyone,” said Emir Dukic, Founder and CEO.A Streamlined Path to STR InvestingTraditionally, investors had to juggle multiple tools for research, property discovery, and financing. Rabbu’s new STR marketplace simplifies the process by combining:

* Exclusive Airbnb investment listings backed by historical revenue data unavailable anywhere else.
* Connections with top STR-focused real estate agents and lenders across the U.S.
* Data-driven tools including profitability calculators, local market analytics, and trend dashboards.

By integrating these components into a single platform, Rabbu empowers users to confidently invest in high-performing opportunities, without needing to be experts in real estate or finance.

Data and Partnerships That Drive ConfidenceRabbu’s proprietary performance data, drawn from thousands of active short-term rentals, gives investors unique insight into property potential and market trends. Combined with its network of STR-specialized lenders and agents, the platform enables users to move seamlessly from research to purchase to financing.

“We saw how excited people were about STR investing but also how many gave up because it was too complex,” Dukic added. “This pivot reflects our mission to make short-term rental investing simple, transparent, and accessible for everyone, from first-time buyers to experienced investors.”Industry partners highlight Rabbu’s timing, as investors seek reliable returns amid shifting travel and real estate trends.
