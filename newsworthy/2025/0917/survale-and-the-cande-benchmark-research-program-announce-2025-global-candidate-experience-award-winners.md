# Survale and the CandE Benchmark Research Program Announce 2025 Global Candidate Experience Award Winners

San Francisco, CA USA (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Sep 17, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Pacific — Survale, the leading provider of candidate and employee experience management solutions, and the 14th annual CandE Benchmark Research and Awards Program, now part of Survale, today revealed the 66 companies from around the world to be recognized for candidate experience excellence as winners of 2025 Global Candidate Experience Awards.

This year 110 companies hiring around the world registered to participate in the 2025 Global CandE Awards Benchmark Research and Awards Program, which ultimately collected the thoughts and experiences of over 66,000 job candidates. The largest study of its kind, the CandE Benchmark Research Program has evaluated responses from over 2,000 global employers and nearly 1.9 million job seekers since 2011.

Winners were identified through a comprehensive data analysis based on their job candidates' satisfaction survey scores. To qualify, each company committed to a statistically significant candidate response minimum, where the proportion of respondents who were not hired met or exceeded a set standard.

The final analysis included four key rating questions that had a significant impact on determining the winners:1. The candidates' overall ranking of their candidate experience
2. Whether or not they would reapply to the organization in the future
3. Whether or not they would refer other job seekers to the organization in the future
4. And how the candidates would change their business relationship status with the organization going forward based on their experience

The above analysis resulted in a final CandE Score for each participating organization. This year 66 organizations big and small across multiple industries will receive 76 CandE Awards due to having the highest positive candidate experience ratings in North America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA); Asia-Pacific (APAC); and Latin America. The CandEs continue its mission of helping companies focus on Candidate Experience and the business value it brings to an organization.
