# MilitaryHire Joins RedBalloon to Transform Military Recruiting

Moscow, Idaho (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Aug 6, 2025 @ 1:40 PM Central — MilitaryHire.com, a trusted source for veteran recruiting for over 25 years, has joined forces with RedBalloon (redballoon.work), an innovative tech company championing human‑centric, values‑based hiring to help the 200,000 service members who transition to civilian life annually and more than 700,000 members of the Guard and Reserve connect with employment opportunities.

This alliance unites Craig Robbins, CEO of MilitaryHire and a combat veteran‑turned‑entrepreneur, with Andrew Crapuchettes, founder and CEO of RedBalloon and former CEO of labor market analytics giant Emsi (now Lightcast.io). Together, they’re addressing one of recruiting’s toughest challenges; the overreliance on AI systems that often screen out qualified veteran talent.

“Military experience is often misunderstood by the data AI relies on to assess fit,” said Robbins. “That’s why MilitaryHire has always focused on real human connections—like our virtual hiring events that bring tens of thousands of veterans and recruiters together each year. When I saw RedBalloon’s platform—technology that uses AI but keeps real hiring conversations at the center—I knew we could reshape veteran recruiting.” RedBalloon’s new recruiting software blends AI with in-platform functionality that allows candidates and recruiters to discuss skill gaps, align values, and find true culture fit. “Employers who overemphasize AI risk overlooking what matters most—culture fit, values alignment, and human judgment,” said Crapuchettes. “Our solutions restore those essentials and will help veterans and employers connect at scale.”

Through this partnership, MilitaryHire customers gain:

* A new recruiting platform that leverages AI but keeps hiring decisions in human hands.
* Innovative recruiting services delivering qualified veteran candidates at a fraction of traditional search firm costs.
* Enhanced marketing tools designed to better attract members of the military community.

MilitaryHire’s transition to RedBalloon’s software will be complete in Q4 2025, with expanded recruiting services available immediately.
