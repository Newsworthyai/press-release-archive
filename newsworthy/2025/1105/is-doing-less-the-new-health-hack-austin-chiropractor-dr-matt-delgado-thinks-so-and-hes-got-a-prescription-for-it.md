# Is Doing Less the New Health Hack? Austin Chiropractor Dr. Matt Delgado Thinks So, and He’s Got a Prescription for It

Austin, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Nov 5, 2025 @ 8:00 AM Central — In a world obsessed with doing more, one chiropractor in Austin is flipping the script, and writing literal prescriptions to slow the heck down.

 Dr. Matt Delgado, a trusted Austin chiropractor and founder of Lifespring Chiropractic, known for his nervous-system-first approach, now hands patients what he calls a Time Out Rx. The concept is simple: instead of chasing another productivity hack, take a strategic pause. Put yourself in time out.

 It’s not a gimmick. It’s a revolt against the burnout culture that almost took him out for good. Now it’s something he helps others with — especially those caught in the specialist shuffle, going from doctor to doctor trying to manage symptoms without anyone looking at the body as a whole.

 Why Are We All Burned Out and What Can We Do About It? Because stress season is here. Because everyone’s overscheduled, overcaffeinated, and under-rested. Because real success — the kind that lasts — comes from doing less, not more.

 “What’s productive for business or our life schedules is rarely productive for our health. So when we say we want to be productive, which category are we really talking about?” — Dr. Matt Delgado

 He learned this the hard way, after his own body crashed from Graves’ Disease. That story’s detailed in the Rock Bottom Podcast, an episode that dropped just before the same creators released Breaking Big Food, a gut-punch documentary on how the food industry’s keeping us sick, anxious, and addicted to sugar.

 WHAT IS “TIME OUT RX”? A “pretend prescription.” A real revolution.Dr. Matt Delgado gives it to overwhelmed patients at Lifespring Chiropractic in Austin as a reminder: stop treating your nervous system like it’s a machine.

 Time Out Rx is built around Lifespring Chiropractic’s Core 4 strategy— the four health levers with the biggest return on investment:

 * Sleep
* Stress
* Movement
* Toxins

 This includes what you put on your plate and in your calendar.

 Yes, blood sugar matters. That’s why Dr. Matt wears a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) — not because he’s diabetic, but because metabolic chaos shows up before a diagnosis ever does.

 You don’t need a medical degree to know your body’s fried. Just look at your calendar, how stimulated you are, your sleep, and your energy levels.”

 Why It’s Time to Break Big Food, and the Habits Breaking Us This isn’t just a personal prescription. It’s a cultural one.

 Breaking Big Food exposes the way processed foods are engineered to hijack our biology and our time. Dr. Matt brings that same lens to modern health expectations. From back-to-back meetings to biohacking extremes like daily ice baths, we’re overdosing on input and starving for simplicity.

 “I’m not the only one saying this. It’s not just food that’s killing us. It's the pace of our lives.”

 As a chiropractor in Austin, Dr. Matt’s approach is rooted in restoring the nervous system — often from slowing down, not speeding up the routine.

 And it’s working. Across Austin, people are rediscovering what real restoration feels like. We’ve been conditioned to see rest as weakness, but the truth is, rest is how we rebuild. Time out isn’t avoidance. It’s the most radical form of productivity we’ve got.

 MINI FAQ Q: What is Time Out Rx?A prescription to put yourself in time out to reduce stress, restore function, and reclaim your energy.

 Q: What’s wrong with being busy?Nothing, until it becomes your identity. Overscheduling leads to underhealing.

 Q: What are the Core 4?Sleep—7 hours minimum. Stress—minimize overstimulation and overscheduling. Movement—focus on steps, not just workouts. Toxins—especially blood sugar and processed foods. When you clean up these four, everything changes.

 Q: How does this show up in your practice?We use nervous system scans, smart rings, and CGM data to track progress and resilience — not just symptom relief.

 Q: Who’s this for?Anyone stuck in “high-functioning burnout.” Especially the ones who think they’re fine.
