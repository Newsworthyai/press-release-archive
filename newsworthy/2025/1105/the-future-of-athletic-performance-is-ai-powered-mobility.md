# The Future of Athletic Performance Is AI-Powered Mobility

Boston, MA (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Nov 5, 2025 @ 9:30 AM Eastern — Founder Tracy Tanguay brings MLB-trusted methods, nervous system intelligence, and Liminal AI to athletes and coaches everywhere.

 Tracy Tanguay, founder of MobilityChick and creator of The Liminal Method, is redefining how athletes move, perform, and recover. Long recognized in professional sports circles, Tanguay’s approach merges biomechanics, neuroscience, and nervous system training to help athletes unlock sustainable power, precision, and longevity.

 Integrating AI and the Future of Movement Tanguay’s newest innovation, Liminal AI, extends her vision beyond traditional training. Built on her proprietary cues, drills, and biomechanical frameworks, Liminal AI is a custom-trained GPT that delivers personalized movement intelligence and nervous system recalibration.

 “We’ve seen what happens when you give pros the tools to move with control, power, and safety,” says Tanguay. “Now it’s time to bring that same intelligence to athletes, coaches, and movers everywhere.”

 Known for transforming athletes across MLB, NHL, PGA, softball, volleyball, triathletes, and runners, Tanguay’s programs are now expanding publicly to give both athletes and coaches access to the same data-driven, nervous system–based methods trusted by the pros.

 From Pro-Level Secrets to Public Access Tanguay’s 12-Week Offseason Mobility Series has become a benchmark for restoring alignment, improving rotation, and building total-body stability. Her teaching bridges the gap between strength and skill, helping athletes of every background feel the same integrated power elite performers experience.

 “Tracy completely changed how I move and recover. Her blend of mobility, nervous system work, and precision training is unlike anything else.” — Jake Cousins, New York Yankees

 The 2025 Ultimate Offseason Giveaway To celebrate the public expansion of her programs, Tanguay is launching her Annual Offseason Giveaway, a $13,000+ performance and recovery package featuring top athletic and wellness brands.

 The campaign includes Rouge Red Light, CamWood Bats, Hyperice, Jaeger Sports, VIVO Barefoot, BAKBON, Stakt, Melan Suncare, Magic Molecule, and 2Twelve, alongside Tanguay’s signature MobilityChick's 12-Week Offseason Mobility Series.

 Each partner contributes to a complete ecosystem of recovery and performance, from red light therapy and barefoot biomechanics to posture correction, elite custom bats, j-bands, and more.

 The giveaway officially kicks off on Instagram Wednesday, November 5, and runs through Friday, November 7 at midnight EST.

 A Movement Revolution for the Nervous System Generation Every brand and prize in the giveaway reflects MobilityChick’s core philosophy: recovery through intelligence, alignment through awareness and intention, and performance through nervous system safety.

 “This is your offseason edge,” says Tanguay. “These tools represent the next era of athletic evolution, where movement, mind, and technology merge to help humans feel fully alive in their bodies.”
