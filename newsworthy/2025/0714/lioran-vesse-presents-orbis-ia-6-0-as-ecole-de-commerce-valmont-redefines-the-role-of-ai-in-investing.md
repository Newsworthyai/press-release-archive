Bridging Technology and EducationAs part of the school’s broader mission, Orbis IA 6.0 will be embedded into classroom instruction, enabling students and investors alike to learn through hands-on experience with cutting-edge tools. This integration is a core pillar of the institution’s goal to democratize finance through practical knowledge and technological literacy.

“Too often, investing feels inaccessible or intimidating. Our goal is to change that,” Vesse adds. “By teaching through technology, we build resilience, awareness, and confidence.”With Orbis IA 6.0, École de commerce Valmont positions itself not only as a leading educational institution, but as a force driving the next wave of ethical, intelligent finance.
