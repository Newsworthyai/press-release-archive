# Bud &amp; Mary’s Brings Flavor Forward Medical Grade Precision to Illinois with the Launch of Batch

Chicago, Illinois (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Jul 14, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Central — Batch by Bud & Mary's, the flavor-forward, effects-based brand from one of America’s most trusted licensed operators, is now available in Illinois dispensaries. With roots as a family-run business and a reputation for producing reliable, medical-grade cannabis, Bud & Mary's enters the Illinois market with a commitment to product consistency, cutting-edge research, and consumer education.

Bud & Mary's Batch launch in Illinois marks a strategic, long-term investment in one of the country’s most dynamic adult-use and medical cannabis markets. The debut Batch Cartridge product lineup features both 1G and 2G formats, built with custom hardware and precision-formulated oil to deliver a consistently exceptional experience.

* Batch Flavors offer full-spectrum, ultra-purified distillate with no artificial flavoring and customized fruit terpene profiles. Flavors options include Peachy Keen, Dazzleberry, and Shwazzberry, each designed to provide a distinct, flavorful journey.
* Batch Signature represents the pinnacle of strain-specific excellence. This full-spectrum, high-potency line is crafted for cannabis connoisseurs seeking cannabis strain terpene profiles and elevated effects, available in Sativa, Indica, and Hybrid varieties that embody the intersection of precision and potency.

“Illinois is an exciting next chapter for us,” said Lindsey Fuchs, vice president of sales at Bud & Mary’s. “We see a sophisticated and growing consumer base here. Our Illinois launch brings the same consistent, medical-grade products that have earned the trust of patients and customers across every market we serve. This isn’t just about selling vapes. It’s about delivering on what we promise and our commitment to improving lives.” A deep scientific foundation sets Bud & Mary’s apart from the rest. The company holds multiple patents, actively pursues cannabis research grants, and operates with a pharmaceutical-grade approach to quality assurance. From cultivation through extraction, each step of the process is designed to maximize consistency, transparency, and consumer safety.

As Batch Extracts launches across the state, Bud & Mary’s is also kicking off a series of activation efforts, including Best Buds Inner Circle, an exclusive network for budtenders, retailers, and cannabis industry insiders across Illinois. Designed to celebrate and support those on the frontlines of cannabis culture, Best Buds offers product sneak peeks, swag, giveaways, educational events, and real connection with community.

“Best Buds is our way of saying thank you to the people shaping this industry every day, from the sales floor to the stockroom,” said Rebecca Maestas-Sincere, vice president of marketing at Bud & Mary’s. “Illinois is more than a market to us. It is a community we’re excited to support.”
