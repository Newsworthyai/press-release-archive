# North Bay Legal Announces $675,000 Settlement for Commercial Truck Driver Injured in Napa Valley Head On Collision

Santa Rosa, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Nov 25, 2025 @ 7:00 AM US/Pacific — North Bay Legal has secured a total settlement of $675,000 for a commercial truck driver who suffered significant injuries in a head on collision on a Napa Valley roadway. In addition to the personal injury recovery, the client received nearly $200,000 in workers compensation benefits.

 The collision occurred when another vehicle crossed into the client’s lane, striking his commercial truck head on and forcing it into an off road ditch. The driver sustained neck, back, and shoulder injuries, which later were determined to include significant shoulder tears requiring a full shoulder replacement.

 After a comprehensive investigation and negotiation process, North Bay Legal obtained the maximum policy limit of $500,000 from the third party liability carrier. The firm then secured an additional $175,000 from the client’s underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage, bringing the total personal injury and UIM recovery to $675,000.

 Because the client was working at the time of the collision, he also received close to $200,000 in workers compensation benefits to support his medical care and recovery.

 “This case shows how critical it is to explore every available avenue of compensation, especially when a commercial driver’s ability to return to work is affected,” said the team at North Bay Legal. “We are proud to have helped this client secure the resources he needs to move forward.”

 North Bay Legal emphasizes that every case is different and that past outcomes do not guarantee similar results. However, the firm remains committed to thorough investigation, coordinated claims handling, and advocating aggressively on behalf of injured clients.

 The firm represents individuals throughout Santa Rosa, California who have been injured in trucking and motor vehicle collisions, including commercial drivers facing complex insurance issues and long term medical needs.
