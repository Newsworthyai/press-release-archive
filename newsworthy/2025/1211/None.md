# The Building Texas Show Spotlights Mayor Dylan Hedrick and the Future of Garland, Texas — The Cowboy Hat Capital of Texas

Garland, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Dec 11, 2025 @ 6:43 AM US/Central — The Building Texas Show is proud to release its newest episode featuring Mayor Dylan Hedrick of Garland, Texas, a fast-growing, manufacturing-strong, culturally diverse city now recognized as the Cowboy Hat Capital of Texas. Mayor Hedrick, who stepped into office in June after a competitive runoff election, brings engineering expertise, long-term city council experience, and a citizen-first leadership approach to one of the Metroplex’s most historic and strategically positioned cities.

 After serving six years on the Garland City Council representing District 7, Hedrick was term-limited but far from finished serving his community. “It was either move up or move out,” he shared. The decision to run for mayor came from a belief that he still had more to give — and from a desire to help shape Garland’s future for his young family and for residents across the city.

 As a civil engineer specializing in land development, Mayor Hedrick understands the unique challenges Garland faces as a city that is nearly built out. With limited space to grow horizontally, the path forward requires innovation, redevelopment, and thoughtful vertical expansion. His engineering and business background now directly inform the city’s approach to infrastructure, planning, and economic development.

 A Job That Stays Personal Despite Garland managing multi-million-dollar capital projects and major infrastructure investments, Mayor Hedrick emphasizes that the heart of the job is deeply personal.“You can spend the morning on a major capital project and the afternoon talking with a resident about one pothole — but to that resident, that pothole is city government,” he said.

 Hedrick won his campaign by knocking on thousands of doors and keeps that spirit alive through “Meet the Mayor Mondays,” listening sessions designed to ensure residents feel heard.

 Big Momentum, Big Investment Garland voters recently approved a $360 million bond package, following a previous $427 million package — both catalytic for infrastructure, economic development, and quality-of-life projects.

 “Our voters said yes to growth,” Hedrick explained. “ Garland is a community of moderate means, so we’ve had to do more with less. These bond programs allow us to reposition Garland for the next generation of investment and opportunity.”

 A City Known for Making Things — and Talking About It Garland’s heritage is rooted in manufacturing — from wartime production to today’s robust mix of food processing, product packaging, and specialty goods. The city is home to legacy hat manufacturers, and one of its proudest features is having three cowboy-hat manufacturers that produce over a million hats annually.

 Mayor Hedrick now helps shape Garland’s narrative — not just through policy, but also direct communication with citizens — via his own podcast, Fifth & State. Hosted with the city’s leadership, the podcast gives residents an “inside look at everything Garland, unscripted.”

 Infrastructure, Hospitals, and High-Value Development Garland remains the largest city in the U.S. without a private hospital — a challenge Mayor Hedrick aims to change through strategic land planning and economic incentives. The city is also actively redeveloping major corridors such as I-635 and Shiloh, where state reconstruction projects offer new access opportunities for retailers, developers, and employers.

 Strategic land purchases — more than 60 acres already secured — are helping Garland create shovel-ready sites that close financial gaps for developers and elevate the city’s tax base.

 A City Open for Business — and Dialogue As Garland updates its 25-year comprehensive plan and continues redeveloping key districts, Mayor Hedrick’s message is clear:

 “Garland is open for business. We want to work with innovators, employers, and developers who see the opportunity here. The magic we’ve created downtown can happen across the city.”

 And now, with the launch of the Fifth & State podcast, the city is doubling down on transparency — inviting residents, business owners, and stakeholders into conversations big and small.

 About The Building Texas Show Hosted by Justin McKenzie, The Building Texas Show explores the cities, leaders, and changemakers shaping the future of Texas.
