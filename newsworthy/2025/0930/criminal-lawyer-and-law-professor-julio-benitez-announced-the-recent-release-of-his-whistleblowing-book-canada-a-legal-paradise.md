# Criminal Lawyer and Law Professor Julio Benítez Announced the Recent Release of His Whistleblowing Book, Canada A Legal Paradise

Asuncion, Paraguay (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Sep 30, 2025 @ 11:00 AM Canada/Eastern — What happens when a whistleblower exposes a multi-million-dollar fraud—only to become the prime suspect himself?

In Canada A Legal Paradise, the author unravels the astonishing true story of Eduardo García, a Guatemalan-born financial consultant who immigrated to Canada seeking safety and fairness. Instead, he found himself entangled in a 15-year legal nightmare spanning two continents.

From Paraguay to Canada, boardrooms to courtrooms, the machine moved swiftly: evidence disappeared, judges looked the other way, and powerful men closed ranks to protect billions at stake.

Canada A Legal Paradise is not fiction. It is the true story of how one man uncovered a massive fraud—and learned the hard way that, in Canada, justice is not blind. It’s bought.The real crime wasn’t the fraud -it was the cover-up.

Itaipú Binacional is not merely recognized as a global energy powerhouse and a Guinness World Records winner; it also stands as a prominent symbol of political corruption. This Brazilian-Paraguayan state-owned enterprise has faced numerous allegations of wrongdoing, particularly concerning its financial dealings and the governance of its pension fund (Cajubi https://cajubi.org.py/webcajubi/), resulting in a tarnished reputation. In this context, Itaipú Binacional is actively pursuing Eduardo García, demanding he account for over $20 million that a Canadian judge claims he defrauded from the pension fund. This ruling, however, is predicated on a conspiracy theory that falsely alleges García made bribe payments to directors overseeing the pension fund.

There's a significant issue with this demand for accountability: Eduardo García cannot provide the requested accounting because he never received the alleged sum of money. Moreover, the supposed bribes cited in the allegations simply do not exist. After more than 15 years of relentless pursuit, Itaipú's attempts to imprison Eduardo over any related actions have proven fruitless. Their current strategy appears to be driven by a desire to silence him, as he continues to expose the truth about the events surrounding this case, both in Canada and Paraguay.

The epic struggle between Eduardo and Itaipú cannot be adequately described as a simple case of David versus Goliath; it is far more complex, resembling a confrontation between David and Goliath, alongside an array of formidable adversaries.

This book is designed to consolidate insights from key figures who are well-versed in this matter.
