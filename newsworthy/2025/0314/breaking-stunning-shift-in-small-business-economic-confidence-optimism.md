# Breaking: Stunning Shift in Small Business Economic Confidence & Optimism

Washington DC (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Mar 14, 2025 @ 6:00 AM Pacific — Small businesses are shaking off years of economic gloom and ramping up investment, hiring, and growth planning, according to the latest Freedom Economy Index (FEI) Survey. Conducted in March 2025, the survey of a universe of 50,000 small business owners nationwide shows a seismic shift in sentiment The shift is seismic—80% say their economic faith has spiked since November, and 68% are now betting on economic growth for 2025, a head-rattling shift from last October where 57% were predicting recession.

“These businesses have gone from gloom to boom in a big way,” said Michael Seifert, CEO of PublicSquare. “These are the sentiments of America’s frontline small businesses. You won’t find these survey respondents in Manhattan corporate boardrooms or Silicon Valley c-suites, but rather on main streets in towns all across America.”“Small businesses aren’t just surviving—they’re ready to thrive,” said Andrew Crapuchettes, CEO of RedBalloon.work. “And, they’re ramping up hiring plans and searching for capital so they can put their businesses on the launchpad.”Key Findings1. Economic sentiment is soaring. Four months ago, nearly 60% of small business owners saw a recession coming, per the November FEI. Now 68% are betting on growth for 2025.
