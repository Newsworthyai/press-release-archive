# Only 1 in 3 Organizations Take a Proactive Approach to Labor Law Compliance - New Study by HR.com Research Institute

Jacksons Point, Ontario, Canada (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday May 14, 2025 @ 8:00 AM America/Toronto — Despite growing risks and increasing regulatory complexity, only 33% of organizations take a proactive approach to labor and employment law compliance, according to the HR Research Institute’s (HRRI) new research report, HR.com's State of Legal Compliance and Employment Law 2025.

The study reveals a worrying gap between confidence and capability:

* 78% of HR professionals believe their organization is well prepared for labor and employment compliance issues.
* Yet only 13% strongly agree that their compliance processes use up-to-date technologies, and just 10% report having highly automated systems.
* Over half of respondents expressed dissatisfaction or neutrality regarding the level of automation and integration in their compliance systems.

The report also reveals that only 49% of respondents believe their compliance initiatives are adequately funded, highlighting a major resource gap. Despite this, 34% of organizations have faced at least one employment-related enforcement action in the past year, underscoring the real-world consequences of underinvestment.

Further, 20% rely on outdated systems, 14% have only partially documented procedures, and 9% remain purely reactive—signaling a significant need for modernization and strategic alignment.

“This disconnect between perceived preparedness and actual infrastructure is a red flag,” said Debbie McGrath, Chief Instigator and CEO at HR.com. “Many organizations may be overestimating their readiness while still relying on outdated, inefficient, and underfunded compliance systems.” REPORT DOWNLOAD
