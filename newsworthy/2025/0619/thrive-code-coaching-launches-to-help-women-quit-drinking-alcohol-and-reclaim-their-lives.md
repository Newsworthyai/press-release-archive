I help women build their own roadmap to freedom, starting with just one small spark of willingness and support from someone who truly understands.”Thrive Code Coaching supports women who are sober-curious, exploring recovery, or simply ready to stop drinking for good. Erin’s holistic approach blends behavioral science, habit-change psychology, and Agile techniques in a compassionate, judgment-free space.
