# XOXO Reece Foundation Hosts 4th Annual Birthday Bash to Raise Funds for Local Youth Athletes

Arlington, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Aug 13, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Central — XOXO Reece–an Arlington-based 501c3 nonprofit focused on providing support through scholarships to help girls and boys achieve their dreams–will host its 4th Annual XOXO Reece Birthday Bash on Sunday, August 31. Reece was a competitive gymnast, honor roll student, beloved daughter, sister and friend. Her life was cut tragically short when she died at 14 due to an unexplainable brain hemorrhage. Determined to keep her spirit alive, this event, which will be held on what would have been her 18th birthday, will raise funds to provide scholarships for 10 gymnasts to compete, including entry fees and other competition-related costs, such as travel and lodging.

When: Sunday, August 31, 2025, 3:00pm until 9:00pm

Where: Firehouse Gastro Park; 321 W. Main Street, Grand Prairie 75050

“My family was going through a really tough time financially, so getting this scholarship meant the world to us. Receiving this scholarship allowed me to continue to pursue my love for gymnastics.

This scholarship has truly made a difference in my life, and I know it will do the same for others.” --Rachel HoarFor more information, visit xoxoReece.com or https://linktr.ee/xoxoreece.
