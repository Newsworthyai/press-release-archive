# NuggMD Launches Leading Marijuana Telemedicine Service in Hawaii

Honolulu, HI (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Aug 13, 2025 @ 9:00 AM Eastern — After a recent law went into effect significantly expanding medical cannabis access in Hawaii, NuggMD, the leading telehealth platform for cannabis, today announced that it has expanded its industry-leading service to serve all adult Hawaiians.

While recreational cannabis use remains prohibited in Hawaii, landmark legislation (HB 302) that improves access to medical cannabis in the state went into effect last month. The law allows medical providers to use their own discretion when recommending cannabis, as opposed to a set of qualifying medical conditions, and authorized telehealth. It is the most comprehensive expansion of Hawaii’s medical cannabis program since it was instituted 25 years ago.

NuggMD estimates that approximately 115,000 Hawaiians use cannabis regularly. According to Marijuana Policy Project, just 241 out of more than 15,000 licensed physicians and APRNs in Hawaii currently certify patients for cannabis, meaning that telehealth is an essential ingredient for ensuring that the legislative intent of the medical cannabis statutes is met.

“Most cannabis consumers use the plant for wellness, and absent federal reform, telehealth is the best way to give more people more access. We welcome the expansion of Hawaii’s medical cannabis program and look forward to serving every Hawaiian who needs access,” said Robert Brock, VP of marketing, NuggMD.It costs $98 to get a medical cannabis evaluation in Hawaii through NuggMD. The platform is available from 8 am to 10 pm seven days a week. No appointment is needed, and patients who don't qualify for their state's medical cannabis program won't be charged for their evaluation.
