# Emplify Health and Homecare Hub Pioneer New Model for Patient Care

La Crosse, Wisconsin (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Aug 13, 2025 @ 10:00 AM US/Central — As healthcare rapidly changes and our population ages, the need for innovative solutions to address the growing challenges of their care has never been more pressing.

Emplify Health, a leading not-for-profit regional health system with 11 hospitals and over 100 clinics in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, and Iowa, and Homecare Hub, a cutting-edge home care & housing coordination platform focused on the on-demand creation of high quality small-care homes, are joining forces to revolutionize the way patients transition from hospitals and other acute care settings to the community.

Emplify Health’s exceptional acute care team and Edge, Emplify Health’s innovation investment team, are powering the Homecare Hub investment to improve patient care and outcomes through an integrated technology portfolio. This partnership set to launch in fall 2025 is centered around an innovative model called Transitional Placement Services (TPS), which was concepted within Edge and targets a critical gap in patient care, while supporting the "silver tsunami" of aging populations.

"Emplify Health's partnership with Homecare Hub represents a significant leap forward in coordinated patient care. By implementing TPS, we are addressing a critical gap that has long plagued healthcare, especially as we face the challenges of the 'silver tsunami.' This innovative model ensures that patients receive the high-quality care they need in a timely manner, and it provides our staff with tools and support to manage increasingly complex patient needs. We are proud to be at the forefront of this change, and we believe it will make a meaningful difference in the lives of both our patients and our dedicated healthcare professionals,” shares Andrea Hauser, RN, Vice President of Acute Care and Nursing Practice and Chief Nursing Officer for Emplify Health’s Gundersen Region.

“Solving the post-acute care crisis is highly complex and requires not only a creative solution, which we have been crafting for years, but also innovative health systems willing to work through the complexity to implement the solution and disrupt the status quo. Homecare Hub is thrilled to work with the Emplify Health team to implement the model and further expand across the Midwest. Emplify Health has a tradition of innovation, and their commitment is yet another example of their forward thinking” states Vipan Nikore, MD, CEO of Homecare Hub and a former IBM software developer turned internal medicine physician, who has spent his career discharging patients from hospitals.

The Silver Tsunami and the Healthcare Crisis The "silver tsunami" refers to the significant demographic shift as the baby boomer generation ages, leading to a surge in the number of older adults requiring healthcare services. This trend is compounded by the decreasing availability of long-term care facilities in many regions, including Emplify Health's largest footprints in La Crosse and Green Bay, Wisconsin. The shortage of these facilities has placed an immense burden on hospitals, where clinicians, nurses, and social workers are often stretched thin, trying to manage the complex needs of patients who require long-term care, and where placement into a long-term care environment is delayed or not possible due to a lack of available housing & care options. This has led to not only a poor patient experience as patients wait in hospitals, but also financial losses and contributed to the closing of many hospitals across the country.

The Need for Transitional Placement Services (TPS) TPS is a comprehensive approach designed to ensure that patients with complex needs who face barriers to discharge, receive the appropriate care to be ready for hospital discharge and their return home or to a long-term care environment. This model is particularly crucial for patients who have multiple chronic conditions, require specialized medical equipment, or need ongoing therapy and monitoring. How TPS Works The TPS process begins with a thorough evaluation by a team of specialists, including doctors, nurses, social workers, and care coordinators, followed by discharging patients into a transitional Homecare Hub small home and the development of a personalized care plan. The Emplify Health team collaborates with Homecare Hub's TPS Team to find the most suitable care options to facilitate an optimal discharge, whether it's a long-term care facility, assisted living, another small home, or in-home care. Homecare Hub's advanced technology platform plays a pivotal role in this process. It streamlines the coordination of care by connecting patients with a network of vetted care & housing options and home care providers, ensuring that patients receive high-quality, consistent care. The platform also provides real-time updates and communication tools, allowing the Homecare Hub TPS team to monitor the patient's progress and adjust the Post Acute care plan as needed.

The Initial Launch of TPS in La Crosse To kick off this innovative partnership, Emplify Health and Homecare Hub are launching the initial pilot program in La Crosse, Wisconsin. The launch will include six dedicated beds in Homecare Hub's TPS home, with the plan to expand and create more homes in La Crosse and Green Bay based on demand and pilot data. This dedicated facility will provide fertile ground for the TPS model, allowing teams to assess progress, gather valuable data, and refine their processes. The designated TPS home in La Crosse is designed to provide a seamless transition for patients who have been discharged from the hospital but still require intensive care, social support, or simply do not have their discharge needs met. Homecare Hub will manage all aspects of patient care, from daily medical needs to social and emotional support, ensuring that patients are well-prepared for their return home.

The formal launch of the TPS model is scheduled for fall 2025. Emplify Health and Homecare Hub have been working diligently in preparation, and the launch will mark a significant milestone in the healthcare industry, demonstrating the power of collaboration and innovation in addressing complex patient needs.

Benefits of the Partnership Enhanced Patient Care: By leveraging Homecare Hub's technology platform and their experience overseeing a network of close to 100 small homes in multiple regions in Wisconsin and beyond, and Emplify Health's deep clinical expertise, patients will receive more personalized and efficient care. This ensures that patients have a smoother transition from the hospital to their next care setting and reduces the risk of readmissions.

Reduced Burden on Hospital Staff: Hospital staff, including clinicians, nurses, and social workers, will benefit from the TPS model as it offloads the responsibility of long-term care placement. This allows them to focus on providing acute care and improving patient outcomes.

Increased Hospital Throughput & Cost Efficiency: By optimizing the use of resources, discharging patients in a timelier manner, and minimizing unnecessary hospital readmissions, the partnership aims to lower overall healthcare costs and free up hospital beds for patients requiring inpatient care. Just the initial pilot program in La Crosse is expected to help Emplify Health prevent hundreds of hours in avoidable patient stay time and save hundreds of thousands of dollars which can be put towards patient care.

Scalability and Replicability: The TPS model has enormous potential to scale and replicate and the ability to serve as an exemplary model for the country’s health system. Emplify Health and Homecare Hub are committed to sharing their findings and best practices with the broader healthcare industry, paving the way for a more coordinated and effective approach to post-acute care for other health systems.

Bright Future for Post-Acute Care Homecare Hub has achieved success in the region discharging patients. The positive outcomes data of their partnership with the Froedtert Health System in Milwaukee were recently presented at the Wisconsin Hospital Association's Post Acute Seminar in Madison, WI. Emplify Health's Edge team will serve as the lead investor in Homecare Hub's current investment round and join an already formidable list of Homecare Hub investors that include various leading health systems and organizations. The tightly integrated partnership between Emplify Health and Homecare Hub represents a new era in post-acute patient care. By combining their strengths and expertise, they are creating a unique model built on the power of small homes that not only improves patient outcomes but also supports the healthcare professionals who are on the front lines of care. As the "silver tsunami" continues to reshape the healthcare landscape, the TPS model offers a beacon of hope and a practical solution to one of the most pressing challenges in the industry.
