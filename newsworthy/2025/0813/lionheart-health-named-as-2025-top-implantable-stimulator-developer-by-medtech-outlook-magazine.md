# Lionheart Health Named as 2025 Top Implantable Stimulator Developer by MedTech Outlook Magazine

Huntington Beach, California (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Aug 13, 2025 @ 10:40 AM Pacific — Lionheart Health, Inc., a leading biotech and medical device company focused on healthspan, longevity, and organ regeneration, has been recognized by MedTech Outlook as the Top Implantable Stimulator Developer of the Year.

This prestigious award underscores Lionheart Health’s breakthrough work with its patented KlothoImplant™ and MicroImplant™ stimulator technologies. These advanced devices deliver precise bioelectric signaling sequences designed to control regenerative protein expression on demand. Such proteins play a critical role in homing stem cells to target organs, building new muscle, stimulating blood vessel growth, reducing inflammation, and limiting calcification.

"This micro implant stimulator is able to control stem cell homing, proliferation and differentiation on demand and can release proteins to reverse aging, build muscle, grow new blood vessels and fight chronic inflammation" stated Brian Lasater Chief Technology Officer at Leonhardt Ventures LLC and Lionheart Health, Inc.

Working in collaboration with Leonhardt Ventures LLC, Lionheart Health has patented, developed, and tested its bioelectric stimulation platform for a wide range of applications, including regeneration of internal organs such as the heart, bladder, kidneys, pancreas, liver, brain, eyes, lungs, and gastrointestinal system. Additional applications include blood pressure modulation and hearing restoration.

The company, together with OEM manufacturing partners, has developed a full suite of devices: from clinically validated benchtop stimulators and portable handheld units, to miniaturized implantable stimulators the size of a quarter, and now micro-stimulators as small as a pea. The recognition underscores the progress made in developing implantable stimulators that have successfully passed rigorous testing, including applications for total heart and kidney regeneration.

MedTech Outlook, a leading industry publication, tracks and reports on innovative MedTech trends and solutions that drive meaningful impact for healthcare providers and patients. The publication serves as a vital link between emerging medical technologies, healthcare providers, facilities, and institutions.

Regarding this award, Brian Lasater, CTO of Lionheart Health, Inc. stated,

“Our entire team is honored to be recognized by MedTech Outlook as the Top Implantable Stimulator Developer of 2025. Being acknowledged among the most impactful innovations of the year is truly gratifying.

Lionheart Health has built a strong intellectual property foundation, with more than 500 issued and pending patent claims, multiple FDA 510(k) market clearances, and additional 510(k) applications in process in collaboration with our OEM manufacturing partners. We have developed a comprehensive portfolio of stimulators capable of delivering our patented bioelectric protein expression signaling sequences, which prompt muscle and other target tissues to release specific regenerative proteins on demand.

These proteins include SDF-1 and PDGF for stem cell homing, VEGF and eNOS for improved circulation, a broad range of anti-inflammatory proteins, and key factors for muscle building such as klotho, S100a, and follistatin. Perhaps most exciting is our progress in extending healthspan and longevity through bioelectric signaling aimed at enhancing brain, immune, and muscle health.

Additionally, Lionheart Health was recently named one of the Top 40 semifinalists in the XPRIZE Healthspan competition and continues to advance toward the $81 million grand prize.
