He challenges the status quo, inspires confidence from our clients and employees alike, and brings a clarity of vision that is both grounded and future-focused. There is no one more equipped to guide InfoMart into its next chapter.”As CEO, Townsend will focus on building upon InfoMart’s 30+ year legacy while positioning the company to thrive in a background screening industry increasingly shaped by mergers and acquisitions. In an era where consolidation can compromise service and flexibility, InfoMart remains proudly independent—an advantage that enables the company to stay agile, deeply client-focused, and committed to long-term partnerships. Under Townsend’s leadership, InfoMart will continue investing in technology, refining operational processes, and enhancing the client experience with responsive, people-centered service.

“I’m honored for the opportunity and the trust that InfoMart is offering me,” said Townsend. “InfoMart has always been defined by its people and its commitment to innovation in a complex industry. I'm excited to lead InfoMart into its next chapter by meeting the evolving needs of our clients with smart solutions, sharper service, and the same commitment to trust and transparency that's built our reputation.”Townsend is a former board member of the Professional Background Screening Association (PBSA) and former Chair of the PBSA United States Council. He holds a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice from Valdosta State University and began his career as a licensed private investigator.

His promotion reflects InfoMart’s commitment to cultivating leadership from within and aligning its executive team with a clear and consistent vision for the future.
