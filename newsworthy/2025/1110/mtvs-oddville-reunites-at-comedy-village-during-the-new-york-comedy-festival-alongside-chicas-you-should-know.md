# MTV’s Oddville Reunites at Comedy Village During the New York Comedy Festival Alongside “Chicas You Should Know."

NEW YORK, NY (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Nov 10, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Eastern — Comedy Village in Times Square is making headlines during the New York Comedy Festival with two must-see shows that bridge generations of comedy: the long-awaited MTV Oddville Live: The Reunion and the high-energy Latina showcase “NYC Stand-Up: Chicas You Should Know.”

 MTV Oddville Live: The Reunion For the first time since the late 1990s, the entire Oddville, MTV cast reunites for two exclusive performances on Wednesday, November 13 at 8 PM and 10 PM. Tickets are $28 and available at ComedyVillage.com/events.

 The reunion features Rich Brown, David Greene, Melissa Gabriel, Amazing Amy, Suzanne “Underdog” Muldowney, Handfarter Bruce Gaston, Mr. Phil!, The Zambonies!, Mario Bosco, and Frank & David. The live show revives the weird brilliance and irreverent humor that made Oddville a cult phenomenon.

 “Oddville was one of the most original and hilarious shows ever on MTV, and nothing like it has been seen since. We’re thrilled to welcome the entire cast to the heart of New York City at Comedy Village. This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience and a highlight of the NY Comedy Festival,” said PJ Landers, club owner and lifelong comedian.

 Adapted from the public-access favorite Beyond Vaudeville, Oddville became known for its oddball guests, underground bands, and spontaneous chaos that helped define MTV’s late-night era.

 NYC Stand-Up: Chicas You Should Know Before Oddville takes the stage, Comedy Village spotlights the official New York Comedy Festival showcase “Chicas You Should Know” on Monday, November 11 at 8 PM.

 Created by Gina Brillon, the powerhouse behind Chismosa Comedy and Women Stand Up NYC, Chicas You Should Know celebrates the bold, brilliant voices of New York’s funniest Latinas—“taking the comedy scene by the cajones.”

 Hosted by Paula J. Leon, the lineup features:

 * Daniela Mora (Adult Swim)
* Glorelys Mora (Netflix Is a Joke)
* Isa Medina (Don’t Tell Comedy)
* Becky Granger (Netflix)
* Headliner Gina Brillon (HBO, Amazon Prime)

 Tickets for Chicas You Should Know are $26 and available now at ComedyVillage.com

 The show runs from 8:00 PM to 9:30 PM at Comedy Village, 352 West 44th Street, Times Square, New York City, and is one of the most anticipated events in this year’s festival lineup.
