# Joseph Kopser Honored with 2025 Greg Armstrong Future Texas Legend Veteran Award

Austin, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Nov 10, 2025 @ 4:30 PM Central — The Texas Business Hall of Fame  (TBHF) has named Joseph Kopser, President of Grayline Group and retired U.S. Army Cavalry Officer, as the 2025 recipient of the Greg Armstrong Future Texas Legend Veteran Award. The award was presented during TBHF’s annual induction ceremony on October 29, 2025, recognizing Kopser’s entrepreneurial achievements, leadership in technology and energy innovation, and ongoing contributions to the Texas business community.

 Established in 2019, the Greg Armstrong Future Texas Legend Veteran Award honors exceptional veteran entrepreneurs who exemplify leadership, innovation, and business growth across the state. The award was created by TBHF members Greg Armstrong (Co-Founder, Plains All American Pipeline), Doug Foshee (former Chairman, El Paso Corporation), and John Nau (Founder and former Owner, Silver Eagle Distributors) to celebrate veteran business leaders whose impact—or potential impact—is truly transformational.

 Recipients are chosen for their ability to translate military discipline and strategic thinking into entrepreneurial success and receive a cash award to further their ventures. As a gesture of gratitude, Kopser donated $5,000 back to TBHF to support future veteran-focused programming.

 “Veteran entrepreneurs embody the civic and servant leadership that defines Texas business,” said Meredith Walker, spokesperson for the Texas Business Hall of Fame Foundation. “Leveraging our foundation to connect these leaders with aspiring founders has become one of the most impactful parts of our mission.”

 “Our veteran honorees are our stars—business founders who will no doubt one day stand on our main stage,” added Amanda Brock, 2025 TBHF Chairman. “Joseph Kopser’s record of achievement, mentorship, and service to others exemplifies the spirit of this award.”

 A Career of Service and Strategic Execution A 1993 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, Kopser served 20 years in the U.S. Army, earning the Combat Action Badge and Bronze Star before transitioning to a career in technology, energy, and defense innovation.

 “The military teaches you to focus on the mission, build strong teams, and embrace uncertainty,” Kopser said. “Those same skills define entrepreneurship. This recognition is a profound honor and underscores the potential every veteran brings to the Texas economy.”

 Kopser learned of his selection through a surprise video message from TBHF and entrepreneur Mark Cuban, recognizing his contributions to Texas innovation and the veteran business community.

 Championing the Veteran Entrepreneur Ecosystem Beyond his own ventures, Kopser is a dedicated advocate for veteran entrepreneurs. He plays a key leadership role in the West Point Association of Graduates’ “West Point Entrepreneurs” Shared Interest Group, expanding its outreach and annual West Point Entrepreneur Summit to foster collaboration and networking among military alumni.

 West Point Graduates note that Kopser embodies the West Point ideal of ‘Duty, Honor, Country’ long after his military service. His work nurturing the next generation of entrepreneurs ensures that the leadership and problem-solving skills developed at West Point continue to benefit the business world and our nation.

 Through his leadership at Grayline Group and mentorship across veteran networks, Kopser continues to shape the intersection of technology, national security, and economic growth in Texas. His recognition by TBHF underscores the vital role veterans play in driving innovation and strengthening communities statewide.
