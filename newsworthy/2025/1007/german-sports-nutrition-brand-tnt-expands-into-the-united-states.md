# German Sports Nutrition Brand TNT Expands Into the United States

Boca Raton, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Oct 7, 2025 @ 6:00 AM Pacific — TNT (True Nutrition Technology), one of Germany’s fastest-growing sports nutrition companies, announced today its expansion into the United States. Known for its uncompromising standards and athlete-driven roots, TNT delivers premium supplements built on science, safety, and transparency.

Founded in 2008 when former German national baseball player Michael Weigl opened a small sports supplement shop in Regensburg, the shop grew from a single retail storefront into a trusted multi-brand retailer. Joined by Markus Himmelstoss, former U20 national hockey team goalie, the team launched TNT in 2012 with a clear vision: to create the best-in-class sports supplements backed by independent testing and German precision manufacturing.

“Since our first product, we have relied on independent laboratory analysis to ensure every supplement we produce meets the highest standards—not just our own expectations, but also the promises of our suppliers,” said Weigl. “We don’t just claim quality, we prove it.”Commitment to Quality and TransparencyUnlike many supplement companies, TNT has its entire line tested by external laboratories. Certificates for nutritional content, protein verification, and microbiological safety—including tests for E. coli, salmonella, heavy metals, molds, and yeast—are published alongside each product. All TNT products are manufactured and packaged in Germany under HACCP, IFS, and TÜVNORD standards, providing assurance of transparency, consistency, and safety.

Evidence-Based InnovationTNT products are developed using advanced processing techniques for maximum bioavailability. Enzymatic hydrolysis, for example, breaks proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids for faster digestion and absorption. Unique product innovations include:

* Multivitamin Powder “Micronutrients” – a blend of 24 essential vitamins and minerals enhanced with natural boosters such as green tea extract, spirulina, ginseng, Coenzyme Q10, and grape seed extract.
* Vegan Basics – a vegan-friendly formula providing all essential vitamins and minerals plus creatine for energy and muscle performance.
* Creatine Monohydrate Creapure® – the world’s purest creatine, made in Germany.

This combination of science-backed formulations, innovative ingredient blends, and proven effectiveness has made TNT a trusted choice for a wide range of consumers—from elite athletes striving for peak performance, to older adults seeking preventive health support, to everyday individuals looking to improve their overall wellness.

Expanding Beyond EuropeAlready a leading name in the German and European sports nutrition market, TNT is now entering the United States with the goal of building brand awareness and delivering its proven supplements to American athletes and health-conscious consumers. The company expects to quickly establish a strong foothold in the U.S. market.
