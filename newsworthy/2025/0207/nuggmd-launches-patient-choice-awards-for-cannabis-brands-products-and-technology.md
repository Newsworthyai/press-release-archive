# NuggMD Launches Patient Choice Awards for Cannabis Brands, Products, and Technology

New York City (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Feb 7, 2025 @ 1:15 PM Eastern — Cannabis brands have a new platform on which to promote their products and obtain valuable feedback from their customers in the NuggMD Patient Choice Awards, a new, consumer-driven awards program announced today by the country’s leading telehealth platform for cannabis.

The 2025 Patient Choice Awards will take place digitally. Cannabis consumers will cast votes across five categories: cannabis products, cannabis brands, cannabis dispensaries, cannabis technology, and cannabis creators. NuggMD will validate those votes to ensure integrity and accuracy.

Voting will take place from Feb. 25 to March 31, and the winners will be recognized by NuggMD and its affiliates on April 11.

NuggMD’s representative sample of 1.2m frequent cannabis consumers, which it uses to conduct the NuggMD Cannabis Consumer Poll, will be one primary channel used to drive consumer participation in the awards. Brands that wish to compete can activate their audiences however they wish. The winners will receive recognition and other promotional assets.

“The worn-out stereotypes of cannabis consumers are no longer anywhere close to the reality on the ground. One of the more important trends we’re seeing in our polling is that most people who use cannabis today do so for wellness, not indulgence. They are also much more likely to trust a friend’s product recommendation over a brand’s or budtender’s. It’s time to give patients a real voice in establishing which brands and products serve them the best,” said Robert Brock, VP of marketing, NuggMD.For more information, to register to vote, or to nominate a brand, please visit the NuggMD Patient Choice Awards website.
