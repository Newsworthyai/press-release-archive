# Pharos Expands Into ABC Fine Wine &amp; Spirits, Bringing Premium Infused Beverages to Stores Across Florida

Orlando, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Nov 7, 2025 @ 3:30 PM Pacific — Pharos, the rapidly emerging infused beverage brand known for its clean ingredients and delicious flavor profiles, is proud to announce its official launch into 127 ABC Fine Wine & Spirits locations across Florida. This milestone marks a major step forward in the company’s mission to make premium infused experiences more accessible to consumers statewide.

 In addition to their current presence within the state, Pharos products are now available in ABC stores across Florida, offering customers an exciting new way to enjoy functional, flavor-forward beverages designed for relaxation and social enjoyment.

 Florida represents a particularly meaningful market for Pharos. With one of the largest retiree populations in the country, the state’s vibrant community of active adults and baby boomers is increasingly seeking alternatives to traditional alcohol that deliver balance, relaxation, and great taste without compromise. Pharos, which was founded by a couple in their early 70s, offers clean, modern formulations that meet that moment perfectly.

 “Florida is a place where people embrace connection, warmth, and a good time, whether they’re winding down at sunset or sharing moments with friends. Our beverages were created for exactly that kind of experience, sophisticated, mindful, and easy to enjoy,” said Mary Bernuth, Co-Founder and President of Pharos “We’re thrilled to bring Pharos to the customers of ABC Fine Wine & Spirits.”

 ABC Fine Wine & Spirits is Florida’s leading liquor retailer, with 125 stores across the state. The partnership ensures that Pharos beverages will be available in both major cities and coastal communities, giving the brand strong statewide visibility.

 “The THC beverage category is growing rapidly, and we’re happy to expand our selection with Pharos,” said Dave Larue, Executive Vice President of Sales and Purchasing at ABC Fine Wine & Spirits. “We appreciate Pharos’s innovative approach to reaching an older, 55+ audience that’s increasingly curious about new ways to relax and socialize responsibly.”

 Pharos continues to expand its footprint across key markets in the U.S., with Florida representing a major regional milestone. The brand’s focus on clean ingredients, sessionable flavor, and brand storytelling has helped it rapidly gain traction among retailers and consumers alike.
