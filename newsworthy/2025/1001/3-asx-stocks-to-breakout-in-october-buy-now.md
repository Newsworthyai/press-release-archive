# 3 ASX Stocks to Breakout in October: Buy Now

Melbourne, Australia (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Oct 2, 2025 @ 5:00 AM Australia/Melbourne — Everywhere you look, commentators warn that October is volatile—often synonymous with corrections and crashes. But what if October also presents some of the biggest breakout opportunities of the year?

In this article, we highlight three ASX stocks primed for massive breakouts in October 2025—including one of Australia’s largest companies that has been setting up for five years.

Why October Often Sparks OpportunitiesSeasonally, September and October tend to be weaker months. However, history also shows that such pullbacks often precede powerful rallies. For traders with the right strategies, pullbacks are not red flags but opportunities.

That’s where professional education makes a difference. Through government-accredited Trading courses, Wealth Within has taught thousands how to confidently identify genuine breakouts from false signals.

Stock 1: Bravura Solutions (ASX: BVS )Bravura grabbed headlines with the announcement of a new CEO, Colin Greenhill, starting in January 2026. Market optimism ties to his experience in the financial services and insurance software sectors.

The technical picture:

* Long-term downtrend completed in 2023.
* Price is up more than 700% and now testing the critical $2.50 level.
* A breakout above resistance could initially project gains of 46%, with further potential upside of $70%+ toward all-time highs.

The chart also shows increasing trading volume, confirming buyers are regaining control.

Stock 2: Alumina/Alcoa Corp (ASX: AAI)Alcoa’s ASX listing has followed a familiar path: IPO euphoria, break below issue price, and now, a remarkable recovery almost back to the IPO price.

Why watch it:

* Strongest weekly trading volume since listing, coupled with price reversals upwards.
* Current resistance around $53 (IPO price zone).
* Breaks above these levels could spark rapid expansion with upside to $70+.

As part of the materials sector, alumina and bauxite exposure is gaining tailwinds from broader commodity demand. This setup is a textbook for traders keen on breakout plays.

Stock 3: Rio Tinto (ASX: RIO)The heavyweight in this list, Rio, has frustrated investors for years by grinding sideways. But now it’s flashing its first major breakout signal in over five years.

Key technical factors:

* Long-term downtrend broken for the first time since 2015.
* Strong support built around $110, with resistance near $135 presenting a favourable reward-to-risk ratio.
* Rising volume is accompanying the breakout, adding confidence.

Rio offers the combination of top 20 status, attractive dividends, volatility, and strong growth potential. If history repeats, the upside could be substantial.
