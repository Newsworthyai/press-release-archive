# Lindsay O’Neill’s First Forbes Article Highlights Accountability and Leadership in Health Innovation — Inspired by Industry Leaders

New York, NY (Newsworthy.ai) Saturday Sep 13, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Eastern — Lindsay O’Neill-O’Keefe, CEO of Wellness Eternal and member of the Forbes Business Council, has published her first Forbes article, “Building Trust in Health Innovation Starts with Accountability and Leadership.” The article explores how the rapid expansion of wellness and health technology must be balanced with greater oversight, transparency, and evidence-based safety protocols to build lasting trust among practitioners, entrepreneurs, and consumers.

Insights Informed by Trusted ExpertsO’Neill-O’Keefe draws inspiration from trusted voices such as Dr. Jason Sonners of HBOT USA, Joseph Krieger of Boston BioLife, and research from the Biohacking Index, which evaluates efficacy across emerging health solutions.

She highlights innovators like Oxygen Health Systems, a U.S.-based manufacturer recognized for advancing rigorous safety standards in Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT). With more than 40 chamber models ranging from $8,000 to $80,000+, Oxygen Health Systems has made safe HBOT technology more accessible in both clinical and home settings.

Why Accountability Matters“Entrepreneurs and health leaders are increasingly seeking recovery tools and technologies that reflect the rigor of clinical medicine,” said O’Neill-O’Keefe. “The work being advanced by experts like Dr. Sonners, educators such as Joseph Krieger, and innovators like Oxygen Health Systems demonstrates the accountability and foresight our sector needs.”For example, Dr. Sonners’ published HBOT research shows the importance of differentiating between safe, medically guided protocols versus under-regulated applications. Similarly, Boston BioLife’s physician education initiatives emphasize the role of clinical data and practitioner training in reducing risk as wellness technologies scale.

A Call for LeadershipThe article stresses that true innovation must be paired with responsibility and integrity. By prioritizing accountability and third-party validation, O’Neill-O’Keefe calls for a new standard in health innovation—one where rapid growth is matched by safety, transparency, and trust.

“Safety protocols, efficacy, and leadership are not optional — they are the foundation of trust,” she added. “That is why I turn to credible experts and validated data, such as those found in the Biohacking Index, to ground my work.”Read the Full ArticleThe complete article is available on Forbes: https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2025/09/10/building-trust-in-health-innovation-starts-with-accountability-and-leadership/
