# BEK TV Investigates Unanswered Questions Surrounding Misconduct, Mischief, and Murder in North Dakota

Bismarck, ND (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Mar 3, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Central — BEK TV is launching a special series of investigative reports examining allegations and incidents linked to shady businesses and individuals around Dunseith, North Dakota, at the Canadian border. The series, titled Dunseith Declassified, is hosted Lori Hinz. An alleged assassination, unexplained deaths, stalking and harassment, military secrets, nuclear security, questionable business practices are just some of the connections to be explored.

The debut episode will air on Wednesday, March 5, 2025, at 5pm CT on BEK TV. New weekly episodes are scheduled to run each Wednesday at 5pm CT. Viewers can watch statewide on BEK TV channels or by streaming live and on-demand on the BEK TV+ app.

Dunseith Declassified provides exclusive first-hand accounts and documentation that weaves together fact patterns and timelines so viewers can easily digest and understand the complicated web of lies and deceit. Important questions are raised about potential misconduct and its broader implications for the community of Dunseith, ND, a small town next to the largest Native American tribe in North Dakota (by enrolled members), the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians.

As this special BEK TV series examines many claims and disturbing allegations, this report will shed light on key figures and government officials, as well as circumstances and connections surrounding these troubling events.

“The deeper we dig, the more disturbing this story becomes,” says Lori Hinz, host of Dunseith Declassified. “This series will shine a light on a story that has left many searching for answers.”

Lori Hinz previously hosted two other BEK TV special investigative series, China Conquest: Inside Job and Capturing America’s Heartland: CO2 Pipeline, both produced by Hinz and the BEK TV team.

Viewers with information or tips related to cases and circumstances examined in the series are encouraged to reach out to the BEK TV team. Tips may be submitted by calling 701-712-0099 or emailing tips@beknews.com.

BEK TV is one of the only locally-owned, non-corporate television broadcasting networks remaining in the country and produces more local content than any other television station in the Midwest. It broadcasts in North Dakota on over-the-air television and across the world via streaming on BEK TV+.

The concept behind BEK TV’s programming is to provide a media service platform that is unscripted and uncensored. The majority of BEK TV hosts are untrained broadcasters who share their perspectives and views on topics and issues that people are talking about. The BEK network never controls the messaging.

BEK TV is the 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 winner of the Bismarck Tribune’s Best of the Best contest, selected by the people for “Best Local TV Station”. BEK TV host Lori Hinz is the winner of the 2024 “Best TV Personality” award. Both were chosen by the people.
