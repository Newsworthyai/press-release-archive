# Global Psychedelic Week to Examine How Psychedelics Shape Healing, Mental Health, and Society

San Francisco, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Oct 20, 2025 @ 4:55 PM America/Toronto — Global Psychedelic Week (GPW), the world’s first distributed psychedelic conference, debuts November 3–9, 2025, with a powerful focus on healing, equity, and cultural transformation. Bringing together 130 global speakers and 100 in-person gatherings across the world, GPW 2025 will unite visionary leaders, scientists, Indigenous voices, artists, and advocates for seven days of dialogue, learning, and collective reflection.

Leading Voices in the Psychedelic RenaissanceThis year’s program features some of the most recognized names shaping the future of psychedelics. Rick Doblin, founder of MAPS, will lead “Psychedelics in War Zones & Conflict Areas: Healing Trauma Beyond Borders,” exploring how psychedelic therapies are being applied in crisis-affected regions to foster resilience and recovery.

Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris joins “Science-Led Ventures: Building Businesses Backed by Research,” highlighting how evidence-based approaches are shaping the credibility of emerging psychedelic enterprises.

Renowned musician East Forest opens each day with an original guided meditation created exclusively for GPW, setting a grounded, contemplative tone for the week’s explorations.

Honoring Tradition and Expanding HorizonsOn Legacy Day, “Indigenous Perspectives on Psychedelics: Tradition, Appropriation & Advocacy” features respected elders and cultural protectors such as Tatayo Gabon, who has spent over four decades preserving sacred knowledge and ceremonial practices in Gabon. Artist Olga Mori Díaz, from the Shipibo-Konibo community, will explore “The Influence of Sacred Plants on Indigenous Art and Design,” revealing how visionary medicines inspire the geometric symbology of Kené art.

Women in Psychedelics Day will feature a keynote by Dr. Pamela Kryskow, a leading medical doctor and researcher at the forefront of psychedelic medicine. Her session, “Why Women Must Lead in the Psychedelic Ecosystem,” will explore how collaborative, care-centered approaches—often led by women—are reshaping psychedelic science, therapy, and policy.

Creativity, Consciousness, and the Future of HumanityPhilosopher and storyteller Jason Silva will headline “Satire and Surrealism: Psychedelic Perspectives on Mental Health,” a multimedia keynote experience combining immersive video, sound, and spoken reflection on altered states, technology, and the human psyche.

The closing session, “Can Psychedelics Help Solve Climate Change and Other Existential Crises?” featuring David Luke and Rosalia Watts, will ask how expanded states of consciousness might foster ecological empathy and inspire collective action for the planet.

A Global Movement for Connection and ChangeWith more than 70 community and media partners, Global Psychedelic Week is building a worldwide network of in-person events — from Colombia to Serbia, Jamaica to India — fostering connection and cultural exchange within local communities.

“We’re decentralizing the conversation and meeting people where they are, in their own communities,” said Milica Radovic Mandic, Co-Founder of Global Psychedelic Week. “Rather than one conference in one location, we’re creating a truly global experience that honors local context, relationships, and voices.”“Psychedelic mainstreaming needs a globally inclusive set and setting,” added Dennis Walker, Co-Founder of GPW. “This week is about ensuring the future of psychedelics is shaped not by a few, but by many—across continents, perspectives, and generations.”Registration Now OpenTickets are available now at www.globalpsychedelicweek.com, with 10% off early bird registration. Participants can join the seven-day online program, attend in-person gatherings worldwide, or register as a community host to organize their own local event.
