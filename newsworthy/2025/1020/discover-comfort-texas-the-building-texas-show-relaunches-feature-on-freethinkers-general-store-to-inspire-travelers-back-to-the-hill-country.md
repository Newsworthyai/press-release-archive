Comfort, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Oct 20, 2025 @ 10:00 AM US/Central — The Building Texas Show, hosted by Justin McKenzie, is relaunching a beloved 2024 episode that captures the charm, creativity, and community spirit of Comfort, Texas. The feature spotlights Lisa Jenkins, owner of the Freethinker’s General Store, and celebrates a town that invites everyone to come make memories every weekend in Comfort, Texas.

Originally recorded in 2024, this heartfelt interview shines a light on how small businesses and passionate locals are shaping Comfort’s bright future. Jenkins, a community leader and entrepreneur, shares her journey from running Camp Comfort Bed and Breakfast to opening Freethinker’s General Store—a place filled with unique Hill Country finds, handcrafted goods, and local Texas brands you won’t see anywhere else.

“When visitors experience Comfort—its people, its beauty, its spirit—they come back,” Jenkins shares. “And that’s what we’re all working toward.”The episode captures what makes Comfort such a hidden gem: a welcoming main street, friendly shop owners, and a pace of life that encourages visitors to slow down and soak it all in. Whether you’re strolling High Street’s historic storefronts, discovering live music and local wine, or exploring the serene beauty of the Guadalupe River and Cypress Creek, Comfort offers something special every season.

For Jenkins, supporting her neighbors and preserving the town’s freethinking heritage go hand-in-hand. Her store and her spirit reflect what travelers love most about Comfort — authenticity, warmth, and connection.
