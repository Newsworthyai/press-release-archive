# The Building Texas Show Highlights Historic Hotel Giles: A Gateway to Comfort, Texas

Comfort, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Oct 20, 2025 @ 7:00 AM US/Central — The Building Texas Show has rereleased a 2024 episode spotlighting Hotel Giles, one of the most beloved heritage hotels in the Texas Hill Country. Hosted by Justin McKenzie, the episode takes viewers inside the story of a historic property that has become a symbol of Comfort’s enduring character and hospitality.

Founded in the 1850s by German freethinkers seeking independence and community, Comfort remains a rare unincorporated Texas town with a strong spirit of cooperation. In the episode, McKenzie sits down with Ernie, the innkeeper of Hotel Giles, to talk about preserving that legacy and building a vibrant future for this small but mighty Hill Country destination.

“We immediately fell in love with the sense of community,” Ernie recalls, describing how he and his wife first discovered Comfort in 2016. “The history, the independence, and the way everyone supports each other—it just felt like home.”

A Living Landmark of Heritage and HospitalityHotel Giles, designed by the legendary architect Alfred Giles, stands as a testament to craftsmanship and community pride. Its 19th-century architecture has been carefully maintained while welcoming modern travelers seeking authenticity. The hotel’s Night Sky Certification preserves the pristine Hill Country skies, while its 15 guest rooms, courtyard gazebo, and weekly community events make it a cultural gathering point for locals and visitors alike.

Each Friday evening, the hotel opens its doors for local jam sessions and happy hours, inviting musicians and guests to connect under the stars. Throughout the year, Hotel Giles also hosts songwriter workshops, artist retreats, and car club gatherings—all designed to strengthen Comfort’s creative and economic heartbeat.

“We feel a responsibility to help our neighbors and support our community,” says Ernie. “When guests come here, we want them to feel like family—and when they explore town, we want them to experience everything that makes Comfort special.”The Essence of ComfortMcKenzie describes Comfort as a “step back in time,” where visitors can walk among more than 20 historic buildings, admire the architecture of the 1880s, and still feel a living sense of progress. “Comfort’s story is about preserving identity while inspiring new opportunity,” he says. “Hotel Giles embodies that balance perfectly.”

For travelers seeking a relaxing, historic, and truly Texan experience, Comfort is a must-visit destination—centrally located between Fredericksburg, Kerrville, and Boerne, yet worlds apart in spirit.
