# Building Texas Show Re-Releases Comfort, Texas Episode Featuring The Ingenhuett on High

Comfort, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Oct 20, 2025 @ 12:17 PM US/Central — The Building Texas Show has re-released its 2024 feature on Comfort, Texas, highlighting the restoration of The Ingenhuett on High and the community’s ongoing resilience in the Texas Hill Country.

Hosted by Justin McKenzie, the episode from 2024 features an interview with Craig Leeder, who led the restoration of The Ingenhuett on High after a 2006 fire destroyed much of the historic structure. The building, originally constructed in 1890 by Texas architect Alfred Giles, has been rebuilt as a central event venue that now serves weddings, fundraisers, and community gatherings.

Leeder discussed the process of rebuilding the landmark and the support the project received from local residents. “Once people saw the vision for what this could become, they got behind it,” he said.

Comfort’s origins trace back to German freethinkers who established a community built on independence and cooperation. Today, the town continues that tradition through projects like The Ingenhuett on High, the Comfort Public Library Foundation, and a growing number of local businesses and event spaces that draw visitors to the area.

The episode also explores the town’s position as one of the last remaining small towns in the Hill Country that has retained its original character. “Comfort is a place where people gather, celebrate, and carry forward the spirit of the Hill Country,” McKenzie noted.

As the Hill Country works to recover from recent flooding, the episode encourages Texans to return, support local businesses, and visit Comfort’s High Street district.
