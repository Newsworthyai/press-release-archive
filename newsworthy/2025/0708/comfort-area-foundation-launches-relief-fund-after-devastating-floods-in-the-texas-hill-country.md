# Comfort Area Foundation Launches Relief Fund After Devastating Floods in the Texas Hill Country

Comfort, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Jul 8, 2025 @ 11:39 AM Central — On July 4th, catastrophic flooding swept across the Texas Hill Country, displacing families, destroying homes, and overwhelming local emergency services. In response, the Comfort Area Foundation (CAF)—a trusted nonprofit serving the region for 25 years—has launched the Comfort Flood Relief Fund to help affected communities recover and rebuild.

The devastation has been especially severe in Center Point, TX, where floodwaters destroyed the community’s fire station and caused widespread structural and personal loss. Across Kendall and Kerr Counties, residents are still assessing damage and grappling with the aftermath.

CAF is now accepting donations to deliver immediate and long-term support. 100% of contributions will be directed to vetted local nonprofits assisting flood victims, first responders, and recovery initiatives. Every dollar stays in the region, helping neighbors in need take the first steps toward healing and rebuilding

“In small towns like ours, recovery isn't handled by agencies—it’s neighbors helping neighbors. We’re committed to making sure every dollar reaches the people who need it most,” said Chris Havens, Board President, at the Comfort Area Foundation.

The flooding occurred just 18 months after Comfort installed an early warning siren system as part of its Vision 2050 planning initiative—a community-led roadmap for resilience in the face of growth and environmental challenges.

CAF’s work historically focuses on building a stronger future for the Hill Country. This moment underscores why that mission matters.
