# The Midwife in Vienna Showcases Its Austrian Roots and Sustainable Craftsmanship Amid Ongoing U.S. Expansion

Boca Raton, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Dec 8, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Pacific — As The Midwife in Vienna continues expanding its footprint across the United States — through its availability on OneLavi.com, its upcoming launch on Amazon.com, and its soon-to-debut presence on Walmart.com — the Austrian wellness brand is spotlighting the heritage and sustainable craftsmanship that define its identity. Founded by practicing midwife Sarah Lares, the brand blends nearly 20 years of hands-on birth and postpartum experience with the purity standards, traditions, and environmental values deeply rooted in Austrian culture.

 From ingredient sourcing to minimalist product formulation, every detail reflects the European belief that caring for mothers and babies begins with respecting nature.

 Rooted in Vienna’s Midwifery Tradition Lares began developing her formulations while practicing midwifery in Vienna, where natural, minimally processed remedies remain central to postpartum care. Her guiding principle is simple: the fewer ingredients, the better — a philosophy reflected throughout the brand’s teas, bath blends, and baby skincare essentials.

 “Vienna shaped everything about how I care for mothers,” said Lares, founder of The Midwife in Vienna. “Our midwifery community values honesty, simplicity, and natural solutions. Our products honor those traditions by using only what is necessary — nothing more.”

 This European-informed approach gives the brand a unique position in the U.S. market, where many parents seek cleaner, safer alternatives for early motherhood.

 Organic Ingredients from Trusted European Farms Every product in the line is made using certified organic, food-grade ingredients sourced from Austrian and European farms known for:

 * regenerative cultivation practices,
* strict purity requirements, and
* responsible land stewardship.

 Herbal ingredients are selected for their long-established roles in postpartum recovery and infant wellness. Baby skincare products are intentionally unscented and free of synthetics, preservatives, and fillers — providing a level of purity rarely found in mainstream products.

 This dedication to ingredient integrity has become a hallmark of the brand and a key driver of its U.S. growth.

 Sustainable Craftsmanship, Small-Batch Production All products are crafted in Austria in small batches, a choice that ensures freshness, traceability, and the highest possible quality. This artisan-level approach allows the brand to avoid industrial shortcuts and remain true to its midwifery-led mission.

 Small-batch production enables:

 * precise ingredient control,
* reduced waste,
* a lower environmental footprint, and
* superior consistency from product to product.

 Packaging materials reflect the same ethos, utilizing recyclable or biodegradable options and minimalist design that avoids unnecessary printing, dyes, or plastics.

 A European Lens on Purity, Care, and Responsibility Austria is recognized globally for its strict organic standards, herbal medicine traditions, and environmental protections — all of which influence The Midwife in Vienna’s formulations and philosophy.

 “In Austria, sustainability isn’t something we talk about — it’s something we live,” said Lares. “Our products reflect that mindset: respect for the body, for nature, and for future generations.”

 U.S. Expansion Fueled by Authenticity and Trust As more American families search for transparent, high-quality maternal and baby care, The Midwife in Vienna continues to gain traction across leading U.S. retail channels. Its European-crafted formulations, organic purity, and midwife-guided approach have resonated strongly with parents seeking trustworthy alternatives.

 “Whether in Vienna or the United States, parents want the same thing: safe, authentic products they can trust,” Lares said. “Our mission is to deliver that level of care to families everywhere.”
