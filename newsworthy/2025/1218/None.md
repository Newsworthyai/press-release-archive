# ORGANA International Announces Upcoming OneLavi.com Launch of Its Plant-Derived Trace Minerals Formula

Springville, UT (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Dec 18, 2025 @ 7:00 AM US/Mountain — ORGANA International announced today that its flagship Organa Trace Minerals liquid supplement will soon launch on OneLavi.com, expanding the brand’s U.S. availability and making its popular plant-derived mineral formula easier for consumers to access nationwide.

 “Organa Trace Minerals has been a customer favorite for decades,” said Larry Mills, CEO of ORGANA International. “The upcoming OneLavi.com launch allows more people to experience the benefits of plant-derived minerals — nutrients that today’s modern diets often lack.”

 100% Plant-Derived Minerals for Maximum Absorption Organa Trace Minerals is formulated from decomposed organic plant matter, providing up to 78 naturally occurring trace minerals — including magnesium, zinc, copper, manganese, iron, potassium, selenium, and more.

 Unlike mineral supplements made from rocks, salts, or lab-isolated compounds, ORGANA’s mineral drink is:

 * 100% Plant Derived: Plant-based minerals offer superior compatibility with the human body, allowing for enhanced cellular uptake.

 * Highly Bioavailable: Because it’s a liquid extract, the minerals absorb rapidly at the cellular level — delivering maximum nutritional benefit.
* Pure and Natural: No fillers, Binders, preservatives or additives. Just plant-derived minerals and pharmaceutical-grade water.
* Fulvic Acid for Enhanced Delivery: The formula contains naturally occurring fulvic acid, which helps transport minerals into cells where they are needed most.

 Supporting Nutrient Replenishment in a Modern World Due to soil depletion, fast-paced lifestyles, and nutrient-poor diets, many Americans fall short on essential trace minerals. Organa Trace Minerals is designed to help restore these missing nutrients — supporting energy, focus, recovery, hydration, immune health, and overall wellness.

 Our plant-derived minerals can help fill the nutrient gaps caused by today’s food supply,” Mills added. “This is why we’ve had loyal customers for nearly 30 years.

 Coming Soon to OneLavi.com The upcoming launch on OneLavi.com strengthens ORGANA’s growing U.S. presence. The brand is already available on Amazon.com and Walmart.com, with additional retail announcements coming soon.
