# CannabisRadio.com Celebrates 10 Years of Leading the Conversation in Cannabis, Plant Medicine, and Biohacking

Fort Lauderdale, FL (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Jun 12, 2025 @ 8:00 AM Eastern — CannabisRadio.com, the premier podcast network for legal cannabis, plant medicine, and biohacking/longevity, proudly marks its 10th anniversary. Since launching in 2015, the network has led the conversation on cannabis culture, policy, innovation, and wellness, becoming a trusted platform for education, advocacy, and storytelling.

Over the past decade, CannabisRadio.com has evolved from a pioneering broadcaster into a full-spectrum media hub, reflecting the rapidly shifting landscape of cannabis, plant medicine and wellness. Through authentic content and strategic partnerships, the network has solidified its position as an essential resource for professionals, consumers, and advocates alike.

"Reaching our tenth anniversary is a powerful moment for reflection. From the very beginning, our goal was to create a space for authentic, educational, and forward-thinking conversations in an industry that desperately needed a voice”, Brandy Shapiro-Babin, President of CannabisRadio.com said. "With so much noise in the space, we’ve stayed grounded in one goal: to uplift the people and brands committed to safety, efficacy, and integrity."

A milestone in its history, CannabisRadio.com became the home of "Planting Seeds", the nation’s first cannabis-focused podcast hosted by a sitting state senator. Featuring Pennsylvania State Senator Sharif Street, the show gives listeners a rare insider perspective on the path to cannabis legalization directly from the legislative front lines.

Recognizing the emergence of psychedelic therapies, the network launched a dedicated plant medicine and biohacking vertical in 2022. This expansion introduced programming that educates, demystifies, and deepens public understanding of the therapeutic potential of psychedelics and other naturopathic modalities — areas increasingly tied to mental health, trauma recovery, and longevity.

CannabisRadio.com has also served as the official podcast home for key industry organizations, including the National Cannabis Industry Association (NCIA) and the National Cannabis Risk Management Association (NCRMA) — broadcasting thought leadership and critical discussions to a global audience. The network’s presence at leading industry events and trade shows has brought real-time insights and exclusive interviews to listeners around the world.

"From the early days of legalization to the current wave of innovation in plant medicine, CannabisRadio.com has been there to chronicle every step of the journey," said Daron Babin, Founder and CEO of CannabisRadio.com. "We are incredibly proud of the platform we've built and the community we've fostered. Our 10th anniversary is a celebration of the pioneers, advocates, and entrepreneurs who have shared their stories with us and our listeners."

A Decade of Documenting Cannabis Culture & Wellness InnovationFounded in 2015, CannabisRadio.com emerged as a professional, stigma-breaking voice in a newly legalizing cannabis landscape. In its early years, the network focused on policy, advocacy, and social justice — featuring interviews with legal experts, activists, and entrepreneurs at the forefront of reform.

As the industry matured, CannabisRadio.com expanded its programming to cover business, science, cultivation, lifestyle, and wellness, aligning with the increasing complexity and professionalism of the space. Key partnerships with national organizations and consistent coverage of flagship industry events cemented the network’s status as a trusted media outlet.

Today, after a decade of broadcasting, CannabisRadio.com stands as the most established and respected podcast network in the cannabis and psychedelic space, with a rich archive of content that documents the industry's past, present, and future.
