# 93% of Birmingham, England Residents Won’t Reduce Waste Despite Ongoing Bin Strikes

Birmingham, UK (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Jun 13, 2025 @ 10:00 AM Europe/London — Binit Bags, a leading provider of sustainable waste management solutions based in the West Midlands, England, has announced the results of a recent poll shedding light on the impact of Birmingham's ongoing bin strikes on residents' waste disposal practices.

In a survey conducted by Binit Bags and targeted at Birmingham residents, it was revealed that a staggering 93% of respondents stated they would not decrease their waste production despite the visible build-up caused by the strikes. This percentage emphasises a prevailing reluctance among residents to alter their waste management habits in the face of external challenges.

Regarding the survey findings, Charlie Harding on behalf of Binit Bags commented, "The poll results underscore a critical gap between awareness of sustainable waste practices and actionable steps taken by residents. It is evident that there is a pressing need to bridge this divide and encourage more proactive waste reduction efforts in our community."

In light of the poll results, Binit Bags is reaffirming its steadfast commitment to promoting sustainability through its eco-friendly initiatives. This commitment is exemplified by the company's production of 100% recycled bin bags that are proudly made in the UK. Additionally, Binit is actively supporting local litter-picking groups, such as Litterwatch in Tipton, by providing essential waste disposal bags for community clean-up activities and fundraising events.

Speaking on the company's sustainability efforts and community partnerships, Charlie Harding added, "We are dedicated to facilitating positive environmental change by empowering local residents to participate in litter-picking initiatives and reduce waste in our neighbourhoods. By collaborating with organisations like Litterwatch, we aim to foster a culture of environmental responsibility and collective action."

“Litter Watch’s campaigns, like The Big Spring Clean, have already united thousands of volunteers to make Sandwell cleaner and greener,” said Alicia Wingfield, Chief Officer of Litter Watch. “With the support of partners like BinIt Bags, we can continue to expand these efforts and inspire even more people to take action.”As Birmingham continues to grapple with the challenges posed by the bin strikes, Binit Bags encourages residents to join hands in combating waste accumulation and minimising environmental impact through proactive waste management practices and community engagement activities.
