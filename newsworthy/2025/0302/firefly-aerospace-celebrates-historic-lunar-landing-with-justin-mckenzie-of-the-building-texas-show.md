# Firefly Aerospace Celebrates Historic Lunar Landing with Justin McKenzie of The Building Texas Show

Cedar Park, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Sunday Mar 2, 2025 @ 4:00 AM US/Central — Firefly Aerospace, a leader in space transportation and lunar exploration, celebrated the successful landing of its Blue Ghost lunar lander on the Moon’s surface with special guest Justin McKenzie, host of The Building Texas Show. McKenzie was on hand at Firefly’s Mission Operations Center in Cedar Park, Texas, to witness the historic event and conduct interviews with space industry leaders. These interviews will be featured in upcoming episodes of The Building Texas Show podcast, offering listeners an inside look at the groundbreaking mission and the future of space exploration.

 Mission Highlights Firefly’s Blue Ghost Mission 1 (also known as Ghost Riders in the Sky) successfully delivered 10 NASA science and technology instruments to the Moon’s Mare Crisium basin, marking a significant milestone in commercial lunar exploration. The mission, part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative, launched on January 15 from Kennedy Space Center aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and completed a 45-day journey spanning approximately 2.8 million miles.

 * Landing Site: Mare Crisium, near the historic Apollo 11 landing site in Mare Tranquillitatis (Sea of Tranquility).
* Payload Delivery: Successful deployment of 10 NASA instruments, including the Lunar Global Navigation Satellite System Receiver Experiment (LUGRA), Radiation Tolerant Computer (RAD PC), and Electrodynamic Dust Shield (EDS).
* Landing Mechanics: Blue Ghost utilized advanced vision navigation and eight RCS thrusters (nicknamed "Spectre") to ensure a safe and precise touchdown.

 A Celebration of Collaboration The successful landing was celebrated by over 750 Firefly employees, known as the "Ghost Riders," who dedicated the mission to their families, colleagues, and future generations of space explorers. Among the attendees was Justin McKenzie, host of The Building Texas Show, who conducted exclusive interviews with Firefly executives, NASA representatives, and other space industry leaders during the event.

 “It was an honor to witness this historic moment and speak with the brilliant minds behind Firefly’s success,” said Justin McKenzie. “This mission is a testament to the innovation and collaboration happening right here in Texas, and I can’t wait to share these stories with our audience.”

 NASA’s CLPS Initiative Blue Ghost Mission 1 is part of NASA’s CLPS initiative, which leverages commercial partnerships to deliver payloads to the Moon. By purchasing delivery services rather than owning missions, NASA aims to reduce costs, encourage innovation, and enable frequent access to the lunar surface.

 “Firefly’s successful landing is a giant leap for commercial lunar exploration,” said Nilka Ramji of NASA Communications. “This mission supports NASA’s Artemis campaign, which will return humans to the Moon and lay the groundwork for sustainable exploration.”

 Future Plans Following the successful landing, Blue Ghost will commence surface operations, deploying payloads and collecting critical data to support future missions. Firefly plans to build on this achievement, enhancing its lunar delivery capabilities and expanding its role in the growing commercial space economy.
