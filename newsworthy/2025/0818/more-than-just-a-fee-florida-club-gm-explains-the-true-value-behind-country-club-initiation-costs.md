# More Than Just a Fee: Florida Club GM Explains the True Value Behind Country Club Initiation Costs

Boynton Beach, FL (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Aug 18, 2025 @ 6:00 AM Pacific — In an era of escalated home prices and growing lifestyle expenses, many homebuyers are reevaluating where and how they invest in their long-term quality of life. For those considering private club communities, one question looms large: Is the country club initiation fee truly worth it?

According to Larry Savvides, CCM, CCE, CAM, Chief Operating Officer and General Manager of Hunters Run Country Club in Boynton Beach, Florida, the answer is a definitive yes, “as long as buyers understand what that fee actually delivers.”

“Too often, people see the initiation fee as a barrier,” said Savvides. “But when you break down what’s included from golf and wellness to dining and social programming, it’s clear that the one-time initiation fee is modest when measured against the exceptional benefits. It’s an investment in a comprehensive lifestyle that streamlines expenses and enriches daily enjoyment.”At clubs like Hunters Run, the initiation fee provides access to a full spectrum of resort-style amenities and services. Members enjoy three championship golf courses, 18 Har-Tru tennis courts, 12 pickleball courts, a 24-hour fitness center, a full-service salon and spa, and a large resort-style pool complex. Along with these physical amenities, members benefit from a robust calendar of cultural events, wellness programs, live entertainment, themed dinners, family activities, and community traditions.

“All of these experiences, if paid for individually elsewhere, can easily surpass the cost of annual dues and fees,” added Savvides. “But when you’re part of a country club, they’re bundled together in a way that offers convenience, consistency, and great value.”

Savvides notes that many buyers enter the conversation focused on the upfront cost without fully considering the long-term savings and lifestyle benefits. “Yes, there’s a one-time initiation fee,” he said. “But it unlocks an entire infrastructure that has already been built, staffed, and maintained to the highest standards. You’re buying into a way of life, one that supports your wellness, social life, and recreation from day one.”

As a member-owned club, Hunters Run reinvests members' dollars back into the community. This means ongoing upgrades to golf, racquet sports, dining, wellness, and other facilities are all managed with long-term sustainability and quality in mind. Recent investments include refreshed clubhouse interiors, modernized dining areas, an elevated wellness center, and an expanded racquet sports complex to accommodate rising demand for tennis and pickleball.

Hunters Run spans over 1,000 acres and includes more than 1,600 homes, ranging from condominiums and villas, townhomes, and single-family residences. This variety lets buyers find a home that matches their lifestyle and budget, while gaining access to the same full suite of club amenities.

Savvides emphasizes that the advantages of country club living extend well beyond physical features. “People often come for the golf or the facilities, but they stay for the community,” he said. “It’s a place to connect, unwind, and make memories. The fee supports all of that and helps ensure the club remains strong for future generations.”

He encourages buyers to compare the real costs of a country club lifestyle with those of maintaining multiple memberships and services elsewhere. “You could easily be paying for a gym, personal training, dining out, entertainment, tennis lessons, social events, scrambling for tee times at public courses and more, all spread out across town,” Savvides said. “Here, it’s all under one roof, and you’re part of something that grows with you.”

The club’s diverse membership includes families, retirees, seasonal residents, and professionals seeking a more connected way to live, socialize, and stay active. Whether raising children, planning for retirement, or just looking for a better balance between leisure and convenience, Savvides says a well-managed club community can offer unmatched peace of mind.

For those still questioning whether the initiation fee is worth it, Savvides offers this advice: “Ask yourself what you really want from your home. Is it just four walls, or is it a lifestyle? If it’s the latter, then country club living, and the fees that support it, might be the smartest investment you’ll ever make.”
