# NewsRamp Announces Expansion to 80+ Distribution Endpoints, Strengthening Its Proprietary News Amplification Network

Boerne, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Dec 29, 2025 @ 1:30 PM Pacific — NewsRamp, a media technology platform designed to extend and amplify published news, today announced the expansion of its proprietary distribution network to more than 80 active endpoints, significantly increasing the reach and discoverability available to press release newswires and content creators that distribute through the NewsRamp ecosystem.

 The expanded network includes a growing portfolio of topic-focused, geographic, and format-driven news destinations—each designed to help published news travel further, surface more often, and remain discoverable across search engines, AI systems, and modern content platforms.

 Built for Newswires and Content Creators NewsRamp was built specifically to serve press release newswires, publishers, and content creators seeking to enhance the value of their existing distribution without replacing their core platforms or editorial workflows.

 Rather than syndicating identical content across generic sites, NewsRamp transforms published news into multiple unique formats and distributes them across a diversified network of owned and partner properties. This approach helps participating newswires and creators expand reach, improve contextual relevance, and reinforce discoverability across an increasingly fragmented media and discovery landscape.

 New Endpoints Across Topic, Geography, and Format With the addition of more than 80 endpoints, the NewsRamp network now includes:

 * Burstable.news – A website-embedded news publishing platform that adds fresh, uniquely formatted business news to partner sites, creating a growing network of additional distribution endpoints across the NewsRamp ecosystem.
* FAQ Staq News – A question-and-answer–based news format that converts press releases into structured FAQ-style content, creating additional unique distribution endpoints across the NewsRamp network.
* NewsCrafters.com – A platform bridging paid press releases and earned media through curated, editorial-style coverage.
* In-Focus Network – A growing network of vertical, topic-focused news sites covering industries such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), charities, real estate, health and wellness, nutrition, politics, leadership, legal, book publishing, human resources, nonprofits, emerging technology, and many more.
* Busy City News – A geographic-focused network delivering regionally relevant news across dozens of key U.S. cities including Arlington Texas, Los Angeles California, Philadelphia Pennsylvania, Baltimore Maryland, Jersey City New Jersey, District of Columbia and dozens of others.
* International – Dozens of regional sites throughout the United Kingdom, Canada and Mexico.
* Hola Mes Amis - Extends the NewsRamp reach to native Spanish, French, Portuguese and German speaking audiences, giving us a global reach of over 1 billion readers.

 Together, these endpoints allow participating newswires and content creators to distribute news into contextually aligned environments, strengthening relevance, credibility, and long-term visibility.

 Designed for Modern Discoverability As discovery increasingly occurs across search engines, AI-generated answers, aggregators, newsletters, podcasts, and social platforms—often without a click—NewsRamp is designed to help published news remain visible and accessible wherever audiences and systems surface information.

 By extending a single press release into multiple formats and placements, the NewsRamp network reinforces discoverability over time while preserving a clear and consistent source of truth. This approach supports stronger performance across search, AI-driven discovery, and downstream content reuse—without fragmenting or duplicating signals.

 Partner Perspective Most newswires and content creators already do a great job publishing news,” said David McInnis, founder of PRWeb and Co-founder of NewsRamp. “The challenge today isn’t publishing—it’s ensuring that news continues to travel, surface, and remain relevant across modern discovery channels. NewsRamp was built to solve that problem by extending distribution in ways legacy syndication models were never designed to handle.

 "Expanding to more than 80 endpoints reflects our focus on building durable distribution infrastructure, not one-off placements,” said Mark M. Willaman, Co-founder of NewsRamp. “For newswires and content creators, NewsRamp offers a way to increase the value of every release they already distribute—by improving reach, context, and discoverability across platforms that increasingly shape how news is found and consumed."

 Press release newswires interested in expanded distribution of their press releases through the NewsRamp network can do so by contacting PRConnect, NewsRamp’s exclusive reseller for press release syndication and amplification.

 Looking Ahead NewsRamp plans to continue expanding its proprietary endpoint network in 2026, with additional topic-specific, geographic, and format-driven destinations currently in development. The company will also introduce enhanced reporting and partner-level insights to help newswires and content creators better understand how extended distribution contributes to visibility, engagement, and long-term discoverability.
