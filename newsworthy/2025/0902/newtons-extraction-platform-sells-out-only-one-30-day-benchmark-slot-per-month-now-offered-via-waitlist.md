# Newton’s Extraction Platform Sells Out — Only One 30-Day Benchmark Slot Per Month Now Offered via Waitlist

New York, NY (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Sep 2, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Eastern — Newton Insights, a leading innovative solutions company powering AI-driven insights for cannabis extraction, today announced that the initial series is fully allocated—secured within two weeks of the company’s public announcement.

Newton understands the challenges facing operators today—tight margins, capital constraints, and ongoing uncertainty. By offering a benchmark Newton removes the financial risk that has historically kept teams from adopting new solutions.

Teams get immediate proof and instant relief with zero workflow changes. It’s a true partnership that removes all risk from operators through Newton’s 30-Day Benchmark Guarantee.

Visibility unlocks levers that change everything—often exposing $20,000–$90,000 in monthly inefficiencies teams didn’t know existed. The data does the talking, and if Newton doesn’t uncover measurable yield or cost savings, operators owe nothing.

Early adopters are already expanding their allocations. Teams are requesting additional units to standardize visibility and empower leadership across multiple sites. Newton’s benchmark has enabled organizations to expose and eliminate hidden waste, aligning decision-making between operators and management. For an industry where cash is scarce and risk is high, Newton’s approach is built as a partnership: limited units, high-touch onboarding, and guaranteed proof before commitment.

Visibility and process-control tools are standard in other industries; cannabis is now waking up to the immediate impact of implementing these solutions.

Bryan Fields, Co-Founder of Newton Insights, said: “Extraction teams recognize that real-time visibility is no longer optional—it’s a key pillar in navigating today’s margin compression and industry shifts. Our fully reserved launch proves that live, data-driven control is becoming standard infrastructure for forward-thinking extraction teams.”

The industry’s first real-time process-control platform delivers inline cannabinoid quantification, real-time THC monitoring, intelligent alerts, cost-control monitoring, and continuous optimization on every run. Most teams unlock these benefits in under 15 minutes—simply by gaining visibility, with zero changes to existing workflows. The cannabis extraction software supports hydrocarbon extraction and other modalities to help teams reduce downtime and increase yield.

“The cannabis extraction industry has been plagued by guesswork—teams adjusting temperatures, pressures, and recovery rates based on intuition rather than data,” explained Kellan Finney, Co-Founder.Apply for a Benchmark

Given expansion requests from current users, benchmark capacity remains limited. Confirmations are issued in waves, with earlier slots released to the waitlist as they become available.
