# Reimagining the Ancient World: James Ernest Brown’s Breakthrough Pyramid Film Wins Bronze International Telly Award

Pagosa Springs, CO (Newsworthy.ai) Saturday Jun 28, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Eastern — In a world that has grown comfortable with the well-worn narratives of the past, author and pyramid researcher James Ernest Brown invites us to ask a different question:

What if we’ve misunderstood everything?That question burns at the heart of "Fire in Middle," a provocative new short film produced by Find Fire Digital and Cayce Aaron Brown, Executive Producer, now streaming on Brown’s YouTube channel Hidden Truths of Ancient Egypt.

The film was the inspiration of Cayce Aaron Brown and he wrote the entire script. The film has been hailed for its cinematic depth and thought-provoking narrative and was recently honored with a Bronze Telly Award, a prestigious accolade recognizing excellence in video and television across all screens.

This is no ordinary documentary. “Fire in Middle” is the first in a trilogy that dares to challenge the accepted views of Egypt’s ancient marvels. At just under 10 minutes, the film serves as both invitation and ignition—igniting curiosity, questions, and conversation around the true purpose of the pyramids. In a series that blends ancient knowledge, modern engineering insight, and a touch of the eternal, Brown reveals a new lens through which to see one of humanity’s greatest architectural mysteries.

“I don’t believe the pyramids were tombs,” Brown states in the film. “I believe they were machines—purpose-built, grounded in physics, and capable of extraordinary function.”Brown’s hypothesis, illustrated through masterful animation and elegant narration, points to the pyramids’ alignment, geometry, and interior layout as evidence of energetic design. “Fire in Middle” posits that the Great Pyramid of Giza was not just symbolic, but functional—capable of compressing air, separating elements, and facilitating energy transfer on a scale we are only beginning to comprehend.

The film’s title refers to the mysterious chamber at the heart of the Great Pyramid, where Brown argues thermal energy may have been focused and manipulated in deliberate, structured ways—long before the modern era of turbines and circuit boards.

This bold new direction follows Brown’s recent appearance on Ancient Aliens, where his theories on pyramid technology received national attention. (Season 20, Episode 17 Egypt’s Giant Tombs). The recognition from The Telly Awards affirms what viewers of Brown’s books and lectures have long suspected: that his work is not only intellectually compelling, but visually and emotionally resonant.

“This isn’t about disproving history,” Brown notes. “It’s about widening our lens. It’s about honoring the brilliance of the ancients while asking better questions of ourselves.”The upcoming episodes in the series promise even deeper revelations. For now, “Fire in Middle” stands as a milestone—an awakening—for those ready to question, explore, and see the pyramids not as monuments to the dead, but as machines of life.
