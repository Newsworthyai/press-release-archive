Hershey, PA (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Oct 16, 2025 @ 5:00 AM Pacific — The Professional Alliance for Child Centered Safety (PACCS) will host an online event featuring Janette Hermann, MSocSc, presenting her research on handling false sexual abuse allegations in custody cases. The session, titled "Judicial Decision-Making in False Sexual Abuse Allegations: Placing the Child at the Centre of Justice," examines critical challenges and offers recommendations for child-centered justice.

A Groundbreaking Exploration of Child-Centered JusticeHermann’s study, based on interviews with South African magistrates, explores how courts can remain child-centered despite biases, trauma and complex evidence. Key themes include judicial bias, conflicting expert evidence, trauma-informed procedures and strategies to restore the child’s voice in legal processes.

“Forensic social work plays a vital role in this process: bridging the gap between psychological truth and legal evidence, ensuring that every voice, especially that of the child, is both heard and protected,” said Janette Hermann, MSocSc, Criminal Justice Social Work. “The findings from this research serve as a reminder that justice is not only about outcomes but about the processes through which those outcomes are reached. By adopting a trauma-informed, evidence-based and collaborative approach, we can create systems that protect children, support families and uphold the integrity of the justice process.”About the PresenterJanette Hermann is a registered Social Worker and Forensic Practitioner at the Trauma-Informed and Child-Centred Private Practice, as well as at the Teddy Bear Foundation and National Centre for Child Protection in South Africa. Her extensive expertise includes forensic child abuse assessments and trauma-informed interventions.
