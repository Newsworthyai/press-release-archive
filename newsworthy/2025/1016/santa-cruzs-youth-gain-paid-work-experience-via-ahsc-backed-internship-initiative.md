# Santa Cruz’s Youth Gain Paid Work Experience via AHSC-Backed Internship Initiative

Santa Cruz, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Oct 16, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Pacific — Santa Cruz Works, a nonprofit dedicated to cultivating a robust innovation ecosystem in Santa Cruz County, and Digital NEST, a nonprofit empowering underserved California youth with career-launching tech skills, are advancing their partnership to provide valuable workforce development opportunities for young adults through the AHSC 2025–26 Internship Opportunity Program.

Funded by the City of Santa Cruz through the California Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities (AHSC) grant, the program supports paid internships for underserved youth and local businesses, strengthening both career pathways and the regional economy.

The AHSC grant—part of California’s effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions—promotes healthier communities by linking affordable housing with sustainable transportation and equitable economic opportunity. This new internship program advances that mission by connecting local talent to local jobs, reducing commute distances, and fostering a more resilient economy.

Through the program, ten local businesses have welcomed interns for six-month, paid positions. Each participating company receives up to $10,000 in grant funding to compensate their interns—lowering financial barriers for small businesses and startups eager to mentor emerging talent.

Santa Cruz Works recruits participating companies, while Digital NEST handles intern recruiting, training, and case management. Many interns come from bizzNEST, Digital NEST’s youth-powered creative agency, where participants gain paid experience in digital marketing, software development, and design through real client projects.

“This grant is a game-changer for our community,” said Bonnie Lipscomb, Director of Economic Development and Housing for the City of Santa Cruz. “It levels the playing field for residents who have faced systemic barriers to employment, while also eliminating cost concerns for businesses that want to mentor and grow local talent.”“The earn-and-learn model is a proven solution to youth employment challenges,” said Cathy Wright, VP of Partnerships & Innovation at Digital NEST. “By providing paid experience, mentorship, and credentials right in their own communities, we’re preparing young people for wealth-building careers and a more equitable future.”“We’re thrilled by the talent and energy these interns are bringing to local companies,” said Malina Long, Business Development and Programs Manager at Santa Cruz Works. “Their impact will ripple across our community for years to come.”Participating Companies and Interns* Climatize – Julian Guerrero, Video Production Intern
