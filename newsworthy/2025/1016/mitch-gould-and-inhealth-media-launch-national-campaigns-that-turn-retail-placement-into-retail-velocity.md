# Mitch Gould and InHealth Media Launch National Campaigns That Turn Retail Placement Into Retail Velocity

Boca Raton, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Oct 16, 2025 @ 7:00 AM US/Eastern — Mitch Gould, founder and CEO of Nutritional Products International (NPI) and its sister company InHealth Media (IHM), announced a new series of national media and marketing campaigns designed to bridge the gap between retail placement and consumer sell-through.

“Getting the products on the shelf is one thing, but getting the products off the shelf is another,” said Gould. “NPI secures placement. IHM gets it off the shelf by creating compelling media, press releases, and ad campaigns — including national TV tagging campaigns — that drive consumer awareness and retail velocity. Promotion equals velocity.”For more than two decades, Gould’s Evolution of Distribution model has provided international and domestic brands with a turnkey system for U.S. market success — from importation and retail placement through NPI, to full-scale marketing execution through IHM.

Long before Amazon became the retail powerhouse it is today, Gould played a pivotal role in expanding its health, wellness, and sports nutrition categories — experience that continues to guide how he helps emerging brands build momentum and longevity in the marketplace.

Media That Moves ProductsIHM’s experienced team of media professionals knows how to transcend a brand message into the retail distribution arena, creating awareness and engagement that translates to measurable sales. Through strategic TV tagging campaigns, brands are linked directly to leading retailers such as Amazon.com, Walmart, CVS, GNC, and other major accounts, ensuring that every impression drives visibility and conversion

“IHM was built on the idea that a brand story should not just be told — it should be felt,” said Gould. “That emotional connection, supported by national TV tagging and digital integration, is what turns awareness into purchase.”Proven Success with Iconic BrandsThe IHM team has managed high-impact media launches for legendary names such as Hulk Hogan, Ronnie Coleman (8-time Mr. Olympia), and Wayne Gretzky, helping brands break through crowded markets and capture attention through coordinated PR, advertising, and event activations.

Together, NPI and IHM continue to redefine retail success — combining logistics, placement, and promotional expertise into one seamless platform.
