# All Aboard with DDRB: Train-Traveling Folk Duo Seeks Interviews Ahead of Upcoming Amtrak Tour

West Palm Beach, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Jul 30, 2025 @ 8:00 AM Eastern — Acoustic folk duo DDRB is hitting the rails once again, and this time, they’re inviting the media along for the ride. After the warm reception of their debut album Bright Green (released on River Monster Records), DDRB is embarking on a full East Coast tour via Amtrak this September—and are available to be interviewed by podcasts, blogs, and indie publications before they depart.

With their signature blend of harmony-heavy songwriting, dry humor, and heartfelt storytelling, DDRB offers more than just music—they offer movement, literally and emotionally. Their unique method of touring exclusively by train sets them apart in the indie folk scene and mirrors the spirit of their record: personal, scenic, and purposefully unhurried.

“'Bright Green' is about growth, grief, hope, and hanging on," says the duo. "And sometimes about bad coffee and overheard conversations in train stations."The album, recorded between cities and soundchecks, has been called “inspirational and creative” by listeners and showcases DDRB’s poetic approach to everyday struggles. Fans of acts like Iron & Wine, Watchhouse, and The Milk Carton Kids will find a familiar soul in their stripped-down, harmony-first style.

Press, podcasters, and folk-curious storytellers: DDRB is currently scheduling interviews throughout August 2025, leading up to the tour launch in early September. They are available for:

* Podcast interviews (music, travel, DIY touring, or lifestyle-focused)
* Blog or zine Q&As
* Live acoustic performances or radio segments (remote or in-person)

Whether you want to dive into the making of Bright Green, discuss the realities of train travel as musicians, or hear tales from an indie folk duo doing things their own way—DDRB is ready to talk (and maybe sing a little, too).
