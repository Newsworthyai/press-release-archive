# Community Compassion in Action: A Place At Home North Austin and ShareTheWill Foundation Provide Power Chairs to Veterans

Round Rock, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Oct 9, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Central — Home care agency, A Place At Home – North Austin partnered with the ShareTheWill Foundation and founder Will Williams this past Sunday to celebrate a shared mission of compassion and community service. Together, the organizations donated a power scooter to a local veteran and a power wheelchair to a community member in need, continuing their commitment to improving mobility and independence for Central Texans.

For Stacey Eisenberg, owner of A Place At Home – North Austin, this collaboration carries deep personal meaning. When one of her favorite medical lending libraries in the Austin and Round Rock area closed last year, she felt a strong pull to help fill that gap. Since then, she and her team have joined forces with ShareTheWill Foundation to collect and donate more than 34 power wheelchairs, scooters, hospital beds, and other essential medical equipment to veterans and individuals across the community.

“Compassion and service are at the heart of everything we do,” said Eisenberg. “When we see a need, we act. It is a whole family priority for us. Our kids are instrumental in the process. Working with Will and ShareTheWill has allowed us to reach even more people who deserve comfort, dignity, and mobility.”Will Williams, a 26 year Army Ranger veteran and founder of the ShareTheWill Foundation, shared similar sentiments. “Obviously we share a lot with veterans and the veteran community that means so much to us, but we’ll help anyone in the community who we can and is in need,” he said.

The event was a celebration of generosity, unity, and the power of community partnerships to make a tangible difference. Together, A Place At Home – North Austin and the ShareTheWill Foundation continue to turn compassion into action, one donation, one neighbor, and one act of kindness at a time.
