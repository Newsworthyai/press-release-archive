# Blazy Susan Launches Collaborative Campaigns to Support Breast Cancer Awareness in Oklahoma, Colorado, and Nationwide

Oklahoma City, OK (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Oct 9, 2025 @ 8:00 AM Eastern — Blazy Susan, a beloved global accessories and lifestyle brand, in partnership with Left Hand Supply and Mango Cannabis, today announced the launch of its breast cancer awareness campaign, aligning with National Breast Cancer Awareness Month this October and the company’s mission throughout the year. The initiative pairs product sales with meaningful donations to nonprofit organizations working in the communities these trifecta of companies serve in Oklahoma, demonstrating the role ancillary and cannabis companies can play in supporting care for uninsured women, and sharing the voices of survivors.

October has been recognized as Breast Cancer Awareness Month since the 1980s. It’s called “Pink October” because people worldwide adopt the color pink and display pink ribbons to promote awareness about the importance of prevention and routine screening for early detection of breast cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) predicts that one in 12 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. It is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer globally, and the leading cause of cancer deaths among women.

To help combat this scourge, celebrated lifestyle and accessories brand Blazy Susan is launching a limited-edition pre-roll line in partnership with Left Hand Supply, a medical cannabis company based in Tulsa, OK, in support of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

Leading Oklahoma dispensary chain Mango Cannabis, with outposts in Catoosa, Edmond, Enid, Lawton, Norman, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa, is carrying the entire run of pre-rolls exclusively. A portion of every collaborative pre-roll purchase will fund life-saving breast cancer screenings and care for uninsured women through the Oklahoma Project Woman.

Collectively, the companies pledged a minimum commitment of $10,000. The featured products include Blazy Susan-infused prerolls by Lone Wolf Family Farms.

In Colorado, Blazy Susan will generate contributions from the sales of limited edition Bud & Mary’s five-packs of kief-infused pre-rolls. They are wrapped in Blazy Susan’s pink iconic papers and housed in a custom-designed, collectible pink container.

Additionally, sales from Blazy Susan’s popular pink papers and cones support breast cancer research groups, including the Lynn Sage Breast Cancer Foundation, throughout the year.

On October 25, Blazy Susan will have an exclusive pop-up featuring promotional giveaways at one of Mango’s top dispensaries, located on 6201 Northwest Expressway, Oklahoma City, OK 73132.

Blazy Susan’s CEO, Will Breakell’s mom, is a survivor, and the company’s Director of Impact’s late grandmother was a survivor, but her cousin passed away from this terrible disease at age 36.

“By supporting breast cancer research, we’re working towards a future where breast cancer is a thing of the past,” said Breakell. For press images courtesy of Blazy Susan, please click here.
