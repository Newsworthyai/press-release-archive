# Destinations Texas' 2025 Marion Szurek Leadership Award Presented to Larry Woods, Director, Visit Boerne

Boerne, Texas - September 12, 2025 (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Sep 15, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Central — The Marion Szurek Leadership Award is presented annually at the Destinations Texas Annual Conference. It recognizes a tourism professional whose vision, innovation, and decades of dedicated service have greatly shaped and strengthened the Texas tourism industry, while inspiring and mentoring future generations of leaders.

The 2025 recipient, Larry Woods, is the definition of leadership, mentorship, and service in Texas tourism. With an extraordinary 56-year career, Larry has shaped the industry at local, regional, and statewide levels. His vision, ethics, and commitment to excellence reflect every aspect of the Marion Szurek Leadership Award. As Director of Visit Boerne, Larry and his team have elevated this small Hill Country town into a sought-after destination branded as an “Elevated Hill Country Experience.” Under his leadership, Boerne’s hotel sector has reached historic occupancy and revenue milestones, while continuing to consistently achieve and exceed marketing and advertising goals. These results are not only a testament to his strategic vision but also to his ability to inspire and guide his team to perform at their highest level.

Larry’s impact extends well beyond Boerne. He is a longtime member and advocate of the newly branded “Destinations Texas” (formerly Texas Association of Convention and Visitors Bureaus), serving on its Board of Directors and leading as Chairman in 2023-2024. His leadership has been instrumental in growing memberships, streamlining operations, and ensuring Destinations Texas remains inclusive and valuable to CVBs and DMOs of all sizes. His tireless advocacy for legislation that supports travel and tourism has educated city leaders on the significant economic contributions the industry brings to Texas communities.

Mentorship is one of Larry’s greatest legacies. He has generously shared his time and knowledge with small and mid-sized DMOs across Texas, hosting mentorship programs in Boerne that cover strategic planning, advertising, budgeting, analytics, governance, and best practices for destination growth, resulting in numerous cities benefitting from his guidance. Within the industry, Larry is widely recognized as the go-to person for advice, direction, and encouragement. Larry’s contributions also include long-standing support for the Texas Travel Alliance. He has served two terms on the TTA Board of Directors, led breakout sessions at annual conferences, participated in panel discussions, and promoted TTA’s Tourism College and mentorship programs. In recognition of his decades of service, TTA honored him with its Lifetime Achievement Award in 2021. His leadership has proven especially vital during challenging times. In 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic devastated the travel industry, Larry’s steady guidance and business acumen helped sustain Boerne’s tourism economy. His ability to adapt, reassure stakeholders, and plan for recovery exemplified resilience and vision in action. Larry Woods is more than a leader—he is a mentor, innovator, and trusted advocate for Texas tourism. His remarkable career, dedication to others, and lasting impact on both organizations and individuals embody the spirit of the Marion Szurek Leadership Award.
