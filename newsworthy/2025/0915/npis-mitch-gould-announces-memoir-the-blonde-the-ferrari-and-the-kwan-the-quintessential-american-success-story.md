# NPI’s Mitch Gould Announces Memoir The Blonde, the Ferrari, and the Kwan: The Quintessential American Success Story

Boca Raton, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Sep 15, 2025 @ 7:00 AM US/Eastern — Mitch Gould, founder and CEO of Nutritional Products International (NPI) and creator of the acclaimed “Evolution of Distribution” platform, has written his memoirs. The book, The Blonde, the Ferrari, and the Kwan: The Quintessential American Success Story, offers readers both an inside look at his rise from Brooklyn to global success and a playbook for resilience, innovation, and love.

Written during the COVID-19 pandemic and soon to be released globally on Amazon, the memoir reflects Gould’s desire to share his story with the world. “I wanted people to know that love and success really do exist,” Gould said. “For me, love begins with my wife, Sherry, who has been my partner in everything. And when it comes to success, if I get knocked down, I get back up. That has been the story of my life and career.”

The memoir’s title symbolizes the three pillars of Gould’s life and legacy:* The Blonde: His wife, Sherry, whose partnership has been at the core of his personal and professional success.
* The Ferrari: A symbol of Gould’s transformation to achieving wealth through grit and relentless drive.
* The Kwan: Taken from the movie Jerry McGuire, meaning complete Love, Health, Wealth, and Happiness.

Gould, who has owned Sports Nutrition Innovations with Hulk Hogan, also represented icons such as Steven Seagal, 8x Mr. Olympia Ronnie Coleman, Wayne Gretzky, and Chuck Liddell. From his early days in Brooklyn to building an empire in retail distribution, his story is defined by partnerships with some of the biggest names in sports and entertainment. In his memoir, Gould recounts pioneering celebrity brand launches, helping build Amazon’s sports nutrition category, and creating innovative distribution models that have generated tens of millions in revenue.

Retail is truly in Gould’s DNA. For generations, his family has worked in retail, and today he has sold into virtually every major retailer, including GNC, Walmart, Vitamin World, Vitamin Shoppe, CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid, Costco, Home Depot, and Lowe’s.

One of the defining chapters of Gould’s career—and a highlight of his memoir—is his instrumental role in Amazon’s expansion beyond books into health and wellness. In the early 2000s, working with distributor Muscle Foods, he helped stock Amazon’s new platform with more than 100 sports nutrition and wellness brands, effectively creating the sports nutrition category from the ground up.

This milestone not only cemented Gould’s reputation as a pioneer in retail distribution but also inspired him to develop NPI’s Evolution of Distribution platform, which continues to help international and domestic brands launch successfully across Amazon, Walmart.com, and major brick-and-mortar retailers nationwide.

NPI also works in tandem with its in-house agency, InHealth Media (IHM), which Gould founded to deliver cost-effective PR and marketing campaigns tailored to health and wellness products. Together, NPI and IHM provide a full-service solution, combining distribution, promotion, and sustained brand visibility across retail, media, and digital platforms.

David Schneider, who authored the book’s foreword, writes: “I first met Mitch on the tennis court through our mutual friend, Jimmy Connors. My friendship with Mitch has flourished since then, but my first impression hasn’t changed. What stood out then, and what still stands out, is his competitiveness. Mitch goes through life with a win-at-all-costs attitude. His license plate reads WIFT, reflecting his motto, which you’ll read about in this book. Mitch’s story is a compelling and relevant one: a self-made man who has worked tirelessly to achieve his success and come out on top despite the challenges life has thrown at him. Of course, none of it would have been possible without the support of his wonderful wife, Sherry.”As the driving force behind NPI’s “Evolution of Distribution,” Gould continues to shape the way consumer brands enter and expand in the U.S. market. His memoir not only details the business strategies that made him a global retail force but also highlights the resilience and relationships that defined his journey.

The Blonde, the Ferrari, and the Kwan: The Quintessential American Success Story will be released worldwide on Amazon soon.
