These insights can be filtered by job title, company, state, metro area or zip code over time. Companies can be benchmarked against their competitors. Talent market insights help inform recruitment decisions, understand the competitive landscape, identify trends and uncover new business opportunities.

TalentView is a source for 250+ current talent market metrics. Key metrics include: job postings, compensation, fill days, supply/demand, and employer reviews/sentiment.

Key Use Cases for TalentView Skills, Benefits and Workforce Analysis:

* Skills Analysis - Identify the key skills advertised in jobs to optimize job descriptions, understand trends, and compare against competitors. Often advertised skills can be an indicator of product road maps and company growth strategies.

* Benefits Analysis - Understand the key benefits your competitors are advertising for specific jobs and locations to know how you compare. Identify benefit trends for future consideration.

* Workforce Analysis - 110 million workforce profiles now enhance our supply/demand analysis for a better understanding of the available workers by job title and company in a specific location (state, metro, zip code). This analysis works in conjunction with our supply analysis based on resumes. This information can help determine the level of challenge in filling a role and to identify good sourcing options.
