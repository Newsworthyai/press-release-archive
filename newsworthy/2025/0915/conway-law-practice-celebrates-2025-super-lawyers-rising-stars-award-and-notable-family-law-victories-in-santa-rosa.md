# Conway Law Practice Celebrates 2025 Super Lawyers Rising Stars Award and Notable Family Law Victories in Santa Rosa

Santa Rosa, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Sep 15, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Pacific — Conway Law Practice, a leading family law firm in Santa Rosa, is proud to announce that Andrew Conway has been honored with the prestigious 2025 Super Lawyers Rising Stars award. This recognition highlights Andrew Conway’s exceptional legal expertise, dedication to client advocacy, and commitment to serving the Sonoma County community. Alongside this accolade, Conway Law Practice celebrates two significant family law case outcomes that demonstrate their strategic approach to protecting clients’ rights and prioritizing the best interests of families.

The 2025 Super Lawyers Rising Stars award is a testament to Andrew Conway’s 11 years of experience and his deep roots in Sonoma County. Selected through a rigorous process that evaluates candidates based on professional achievements, peer recognition, and community involvement, this honor places Conway among the top 2.5% of attorneys in California. “We are thrilled to receive this recognition,” said Andrew Conway. “Our mission is to provide compassionate, effective legal support to families navigating complex challenges, and this award reflects our team’s dedication to that goal.”

In a recent custody case, Conway Law Practice secured a favorable outcome for a father facing competing restraining order requests. Despite serious allegations from the mother, Conway’s strategic advocacy demonstrated that her lifestyle was not conducive to caring for the child. The court granted the father primary custody, with the mother receiving limited visitation and a requirement to use Soberlink monitoring. This resolution prioritized the minors’ best interests and showcased Conway Law Practice’s ability to navigate contentious disputes with precision and care.

In another notable case, the Santa Rosa Family Law Attorneys at Conway Law Practice represented a mother seeking to relocate to Southern California with her child. Typically, such move-away requests require a trial or custody evaluation. Through skilled negotiation and a deep understanding of California family law, Conway Law Practice secured a court order allowing the move without the need for a trial, saving the client time, stress, and resources while ensuring the child’s well-being.

These successes underscore Conway Law Practice’s expertise in handling complex family law matters, including divorce, custody disputes, restraining orders, and move-away cases. By combining local knowledge with a client-centered approach, the firm continues to build trust and deliver results for Santa Rosa families.
