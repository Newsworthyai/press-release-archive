# DC Cannabis Summit to Feature Elected Officials and Leading CEOs

Washington, D.C. (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Nov 6, 2025 @ 8:06 AM Central — IgniteIt has announced a strategic partnership with the U.S. Cannabis Roundtable (USCR) to present the Cannabis Capital & Policy Summit, taking place November 17 at the Hilton Washington DC National Mall The Wharf. The one-day event brings together leading operators, investors, and policymakers to advance dialogue on federal cannabis reform and institutional investment in the rapidly evolving U.S. market.

 Following a series of sold-out events in California and Ohio, IgniteIt’s flagship gathering in the nation’s capital marks the company’s most policy-driven program to date. In partnership with USCR, which serves as the voice of America’s regulated cannabis industry in the nation’s capital, the Summit aims to generate real momentum toward meaningful federal change while providing a high-impact platform for business and government leaders shaping the next phase of legalization.

 “USCR has been instrumental in helping us curate a program that reflects where cannabis really is today, at the intersection of business, policy, and investment,” said Patrick Lane, CEO of IgniteIt. “This partnership allows us to bridge the gap between Capitol Hill and the operators building the future of this industry.”

 The agenda features key policymakers and top executives across the cannabis sector, including prominent members of Congress, George Archos (Verano CEO), Charlie Bachtell (Cresco Labs CEO / USCR Chair), Boris Jordan (Curaleaf Executive Chairman), and Kim Rivers (Trulieve CEO / USCR Vice Chair).

 "We are thrilled to partner with the IgniteIt team to organize the premier cannabis industry event in the nation's capital," said Saphira Galoob, acting CEO of USCR. "Our industry is on the cusp of profound and exciting change, and we'll have the opportunity to hear from the leaders driving that change."

 Additional sessions, curated in collaboration with USCR, will tackle the effects of rescheduling, the role of the alcohol industry in shaping the future of cannabis reform, and the ongoing debate around hemp-derived intoxicants. Panels will include regulators, economists, and leading voices from across the DC, Maryland, and Virginia (DMV) region.

 “Our mission has always been to create a forum where serious conversations about cannabis reform can happen alongside serious business discussions,” added Elliot Lane, President of IgniteIt. “Partnering with USCR ensures those conversations reach the people with the power to make change.”

 The event concludes with the IgniteIt Cocktail Reception, offering attendees exclusive networking with decision-makers driving both the policy and capital sides of cannabis’ next chapter.
