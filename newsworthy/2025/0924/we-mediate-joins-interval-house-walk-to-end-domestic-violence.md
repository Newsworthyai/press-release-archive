West Hartford, CT (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Sep 24, 2025 @ 7:00 AM Eastern — In a powerful display of community commitment, Jessica Lastarza, owner and lead attorney at We Mediate CT—a premier divorce mediation and family law firm in West Hartford, Connecticut—and her daughter Ainsley Lastarza are lacing up their walking shoes for the Interval House Walk to End Domestic Violence on October 4, 2025. As co-captains of “Team We Mediate & Ainsley,” they are stepping forward in memory of Jennifer Farber Dulos while advocating for every family that deserves a safe home and a brighter tomorrow.

The annual Interval House Walk, a cornerstone event for domestic violence prevention in Connecticut, draws hundreds of participants to raise awareness, funds, and support for survivors.

"At We Mediate CT, our mission is to guide families through these challenges with empathy and expertise, fostering stronger communities free from fear.
