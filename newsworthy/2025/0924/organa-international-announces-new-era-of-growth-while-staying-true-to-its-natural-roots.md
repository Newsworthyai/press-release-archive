# ORGANA International Announces New Era of Growth While Staying True to Its Natural Roots

Springville, UT (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Sep 24, 2025 @ 7:00 AM US/Mountain — ORGANA International, a pioneer in natural mineral-based wellness products since 1997, is proud to announce its renewed focus on brand visibility and continued expansion in the U.S. marketplace. The company’s products are already available on Amazon, giving consumers convenient access while new distribution partnerships are being prepared.

Founded nearly three decades ago, ORGANA International began with the vision of Sam Curtis, who discovered a unique method to filter decomposed plant matter rich in 76 trace minerals and fulvic acid—powerful nutrients essential to human health. After Curtis’ passing in 2012, longtime industry veteran Larry Mills acquired the company, expanded its product portfolio, and strengthened its customer-first mission.

“ORGANA has always been about giving people access to what nature already provides,” said Mills, CEO of ORGANA International. “With today’s food supply often lacking vital nutrients, our products help restore what’s missing so that people of all ages—children, athletes, families, seniors—can live healthier lives.”A Legacy of Natural, Bioavailable WellnessORGANA’s multi-mineral drink remains a flagship product, offering a convenient way to replenish the body’s essential nutrients in one daily serving. Its line has since expanded to include flavored mineral beverages (cherry, wildberry pomegranate, peach mango), magnesium cream for muscle support, liquid oxygen supplements, silver-based immune support, and Essiac tea for detoxification. All products are formulated with pharmaceutical-grade water and natural ingredients, ensuring bioavailability and safety.

Unlike many synthetic supplements, ORGANA products are naturally derived and tested under a microscope for Brownian movement—a sign the particles are still “alive” and active. With a particle size of just 20 nanometers, the minerals can pass through the skin barrier and down to the cellular level, allowing the body to easily absorb what it needs—and safely excrete what it doesn’t.

Customer-First CommitmentORGANA has proudly maintained a 5-star rating from the Better Business Bureau and upholds a simple but steadfast philosophy: “The customer is always right.” Every purchase is backed by a satisfaction guarantee.

“Success to us isn’t just measured by sales,” Mills added. “It’s when a mother tells us her child feels better, or when an athlete shares that recovery is easier with our products. That’s the real reward.”Looking AheadWhile ORGANA is already on Amazon and has steadily grown its footprint, the company is preparing for broader U.S. distribution to ensure more consumers have access to its products. Details of this expansion will be shared in upcoming announcements.

“Our goal is to put ORGANA into the hands of more people who can benefit from it,” Mills said. “Once they try it, they understand the difference. Many of our customers become customers for life.”About [ORGANA International](https://organa.net/)Founded in 1997, ORGANA International is a wellness company committed to delivering natural, bioavailable products that help people live healthier lives.
