# Buy the September Dip? 8 ASX Stocks to Buy

Melbourne Australia (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Sep 25, 2025 @ 4:00 AM Australia/Melbourne — The Australian stock market is experiencing a seasonal pullback and, as always, investors are asking the important question: is this the start of something bigger or simply another buying opportunity?

In this post, we break down the current dip, analyse key index levels, and spotlight eight ASX stocks that look primed for the next move higher.

Market Pullback: Normal or Dangerous?September is living up to its reputation as one of the weaker months for markets, with the All Ordinaries pulling back. While headlines may spark fear, Wealth Within analysts highlight that healthy pullbacks of 8–14% are normal.

The depth of this correction will determine how strong and how long the next bull run may be. A deeper correction could set up a more sustained rally, while a shallow dip may see the market rise but with less momentum

Why Pullbacks Are Buying OpportunitiesSenior analysts at Wealth Within stress that pullbacks are not signals to panic. Instead, they are the moments traders should prepare for the next round of opportunities. For those who panic-sell, gains are often missed when markets inevitably recover.

If you want to build the skills to know when to buy dips and when to stay out, Wealth Within provides government-accredited Trading courses that give you repeatable strategies to trade confidently.

Eight Stocks to WatchDuring the show, several standout stocks were highlighted as potential winners from this pullback. Here are a few key names discussed by the analysts:

AMP Limited (AMP)Once considered a “dog stock,” AMP has been basing for years and is now showing signs of reversal. If prices hold above $1.80, it could see a strong long-term recovery, with upside potential towards $3–$4 over time.

Woodside Energy (WDS)Despite short-term weakness, Woodside remains fundamentally strong. Pullbacks to levels around $22 make the stock attractive. If it rallies from here, targets of $40–$43 are not unrealistic, replicating past moves.

Pilbara Minerals (PLS)Lithium favourite Pilbara has delivered multiple 100%+ rallies in past cycles. Current pullbacks may set up another strong leg to $3–$4, making it one of the more exciting mid-term plays.

Fortescue Metals (FMG)FMG has repeatedly bounced off the $15 level, with recoveries of 50%+ following each dip. If the pattern continues, a run towards $23 could be on the cards.

OthersAdditional names on the radar included Bank of Queensland (BOQ), Horizon Holdings (AZJ), Woolworths (WOW), and New Hope Coal (NHC). Each offers potential once basing patterns confirm.

Beyond Stock Picks: Building Trading ConfidenceWhile identifying bargain ASX stocks is exciting, successful investing requires more than just tips. The real advantage lies in having a structured system:

* Knowing how to read price trends
* Recognising basing patterns and reversals
* Applying stop-losses for risk management
