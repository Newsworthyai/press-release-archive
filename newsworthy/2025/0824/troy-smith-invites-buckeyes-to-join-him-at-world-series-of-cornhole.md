# Troy Smith Invites Buckeyes to Join Him at World Series of Cornhole

Columbus, Ohio (Newsworthy.ai) Sunday Aug 24, 2025 @ 4:50 PM Central — Heisman Trophy winner and Ohio State legend Troy Smith is stepping onto a different kind of field this fall, as he joins fellow Buckeye greats and Texas Longhorn legends for the inaugural World Series of Cornhole and Legend Shootout Tournament.

The first-of-its-kind event brings together former athletes who have made their mark on the gridiron, now competing in a game of skill and camaraderie. Smith will be joined by fellow Buckeyes, while Texas will be represented by icons including Heisman winner Ricky Williams.

“This is about competition, camaraderie, and creating new spaces for athletes to connect,” said Smith. “It’s fun, it’s lighthearted, but it’s also about addressing something very real—mental health. Athletes go through challenges like anyone else, and it’s important to have healthy outlets and conversations around that.”

Supporting Youth and Mental HealthBeyond the boards, Smith continues his long-standing commitment to giving back. Through his work with the Richard Swinsey Inner City Kids and Youth Foundation, Smith supports under-served youth in Ohio and across the nation, providing resources, mentorship, and access to opportunities in sports and education.

“Mental health is just as important as physical health,” Smith explained. “If our mental health isn’t where it needs to be, the days can pile up, leading to stress, anxiety, or worse. We want to stop that cycle, provide support, and give young people tools to succeed both on and off the field.”

Buckeyes vs. Longhorns: A Rivalry RekindledThe Ohio State vs. Texas showdown promises to be a highlight of the event. With legends like Smith, Ricky Williams, and Vince Young involved, the competition is expected to draw fans from across the country.

“We know Texas fans travel well, but we’re in the championship city,” Smith said with a smile. “I’m confident Buckeye Nation will show up strong to represent.”

Looking AheadAs the college football season kicks off, Smith is also keeping a close eye on the next generation of stars, including quarterbacks like Arch Manning and Drew Allar, as well as future Buckeye greats.

“The Shoe can feel daunting at first,” Smith noted. “But once you embrace the atmosphere, those 100,000 fans lift you up. That’s what being a Buckeye is all about.”
