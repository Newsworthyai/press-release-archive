# NuggMD Announces Winners of 2025 Patient Choice Awards

New York, NY (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Apr 17, 2025 @ 12:10 PM Eastern — More than 3,500 medical cannabis patients made their voices heard by voting for their favorite brands, products, and technologies in the 2025 NuggMD Patient Choice Awards.

NuggMD, the country’s leading telehealth platform for cannabis, today announced the winners and the runners-up across the 36 geographic regions and five base categories—products, brands, dispensaries, technologies, and creators—that were a part of the program. Entrants were sourced directly from cannabis consumers. There was no fee to enter or vote, removing unnecessary bias from the award process.

Trulieve, RISE, Rhythm, and Jeeter were among the brands that took home the top spot in multiple regional categories. Nationally, GravLabs won the Best Glassware category, while G Pen won for Best Vaporizer Hardware. Content creators @dope.as.yola, @dope_kitchen, and @pothead.princess won Gold, Silver, and Bronze, respectively, in the Best Content Creator category.

In total, patients selected winners and two runners-up for more than 350 categories.

“We set up the Patient Choice Awards to shine a spotlight on which brands and products are most popular regionally because, to cannabis consumers, that’s really all there is: a bunch of regional markets that operate relatively autonomously,” said Robert Brock, VP of marketing, NuggMD. “Despite the persistent torment of federal prohibition, entrepreneurship and grit is as alive as it’s ever been in the cannabis sector. Our awards program is, first and foremost, an opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate that.”He continued: “Every cannabis business, from the largest multi-state operators to the smallest regional dispensaries and the most upstart brands, has a meaningful role to play in the industry’s development and maturation. We congratulate the winners, and we are grateful that so many patients participated.”

Voting took place from Feb. 25 to March 31. For a searchable directory of the winners, visit the Patient Choice Awards website.
