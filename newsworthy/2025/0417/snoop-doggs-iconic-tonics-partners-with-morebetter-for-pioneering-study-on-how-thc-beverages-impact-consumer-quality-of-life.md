# Snoop Dogg’s Iconic Tonics Partners with MoreBetter for Pioneering Study on How THC Beverages Impact Consumer Quality of Life

LOS ANGELES (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Apr 17, 2025 @ 8:30 AM Pacific — Iconic Tonics, the new functional beverage company backed by Harmony Craft Beverages and global icon Snoop Dogg, has joined MoreBetter, a leader in Real-World-Data collection and research, in a pioneering study aimed at understanding the impact of THC-infused beverages on mood, quality of life, and alcohol consumption. This innovative study comes at a critical time, as consumers are increasingly curious about trying “better-for-you” alcohol alternatives as Iconic Tonics expands its footprint in the functional beverage category.

Up to 2,000 qualified consumers will report daily feedback over a three-week period on their infused beverage and alcohol consumption patterns and complete standardized self-assessments on their overall quality of life. Iconic Tonics joins other leading beverage brands that are collectively supplying participants with infused beverage products to use throughout the course of the study.

Timely Research Supported by Industry LeadersWith a clear and growing emphasis on personal health and overall wellness, today's consumers are demonstrating a strong desire to be well-informed and more selective regarding the products they choose to incorporate into their daily lives. THC-infused beverage brands want to gain insight into how consumers use their products and what perceived lifestyle impacts or wellness outcomes might result after consumption.

“We hear that infused beverages are improving the quality of life for many consumers, but we need real world data to support such anecdotal claims,” said Kevin Provost, CEO of MoreBetter. “Having influential brands like Snoop’s portfolio at Iconic Tonics supporting observational research in an effort to understand how infused products impact the quality of life of consumers is exactly what will advance this sector in a responsible and data-driven way.”

"At Iconic Tonics, we're committed to providing consumers with high-quality, enjoyable beverages that align with a balanced lifestyle," said Evan Eneman, CEO of Iconic Tonics. "This research with MoreBetter is crucial in helping us understand the real-world effects of our THC-infused drinks. This data is helpful for our own R&D team, for consumers seeking informed choices, and for legislators looking to create responsible regulations for this evolving industry. We believe in the potential of THC beverages as a better-for-you alternative, and this study will provide valuable insights."

“We want to know the impact our beverages have on consumers. It’s about more than just a good time; it’s about how it fits into their overall well-being," said Tiffany Chin, Head of Cannabis/Hemp for Snoop Dogg enterprises.

Iconic Tonics will have products included in the study from both Snoop Dogg brands, Death Row Records Do It Fluid and Dogg lbs Doggy Spritz, as well as Lifeblood by Love Yer Brain, the brand co-founded by Wayne Coyne of the psychedelic rock band, The Flaming Lips. Future studies will include other brands in the portfolio including, Klaus (co-founded by Master Mixologist Warren Bobrow), Herbacée (co-founded by The Herb Somm, Jamie Evans), Malus, and Lift Seltzer.

Adding to the excitement, especially as the annual 4/20 holiday celebrating the plant approaches and the growing acceptance of these products continues, Iconic Tonics is also running a special promotion with DoorDash all week, making their beverages even more accessible.
