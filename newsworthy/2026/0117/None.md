# Vote Like a Texan Explores Growth, Water, and Local Power in Kendall County with Commissioner Chad Carpenter

Kendall County, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Saturday Jan 17, 2026 @ 7:00 AM Central — As rapid growth reshapes communities across the Texas Hill Country, a new episode of Vote Like a Texan takes an in-depth look at how local decisions are made — and why county-level leadership matters more than many voters realize.

 Host Justin McKenzie sits down with Chad Carpenter, Kendall County Commissioner for Precinct 4, for a wide-ranging conversation on infrastructure, water availability, private property rights, emergency services, and the often-misunderstood role of county commissioners in Texas governance.

 Commissioner Carpenter, who is seeking reelection, brings a background in small business ownership and civic leadership to the discussion. He explains that his decision to run for office stemmed from firsthand experience navigating local regulations and witnessing how rising costs and complex permitting processes increasingly limit opportunities for small businesses and landowners.

 “Local government rules are becoming impossible for small businesses to exercise the American dream,” Carpenter said during the interview. “If you want to preserve opportunity for future generations, you have to be willing to step up and be involved.”

 Understanding the Role of County Commissioners A central focus of the episode is educating voters about the power and responsibility of county commissioners — particularly in unincorporated areas where counties serve as the primary layer of government.

 Unlike cities, counties in Texas do not operate under comprehensive master plans. Instead, commissioners court functions as both a legislative and budgetary authority, overseeing roads, emergency services, land-use regulation, and coordination with state agencies.

 “Commissioners court is where decisions are made that affect landowners, ranchers, small businesses, and first responders,” McKenzie noted. “These decisions impact daily life long before most issues ever reach the state level.”

 Growth, Water, and Infrastructure Challenges The conversation highlights growing concerns around large-scale residential development in Kendall County and the strain such projects place on water resources, firefighting capacity, and rural infrastructure.

 Carpenter emphasized that Kendall County is designated by the state as a Priority Groundwater Management Area, signaling long-term concerns about water sustainability. He argued that development decisions must balance private property rights with the responsibility to protect shared resources.

 “You have a right to use your property,” Carpenter said, “but your neighbors also have a right to protection when a project threatens water availability or emergency response capacity.”

 The episode also addresses recent county investments in emergency services, including expanded full-time firefighter coverage and ongoing support for volunteer fire departments — a critical issue across the Hill Country as wildfire risks increase.

 Energy Infrastructure and Legislative Gaps Another major topic discussed is the rapid expansion of battery energy storage facilities across Texas. Carpenter raised concerns about the lack of local regulatory authority over such projects, noting that counties currently have limited ability to consider proximity to schools, aquifers, or rivers when developments are proposed.

 “These projects are moving faster than regulation,” Carpenter explained. “Local governments need clearer authority to protect communities while still supporting responsible infrastructure.”

 Encouraging Voter Participation The episode concludes with a strong call for civic engagement, particularly in primary elections, where turnout is often low but outcomes shape general election choices.

 “If people want a voice in who represents them, the primary election is where that voice matters most,” McKenzie said.

 Carpenter echoed the sentiment, encouraging residents to attend commissioners court meetings, ask questions, and stay informed about local governance.
