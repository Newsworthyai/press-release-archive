# Building Del Rio, Texas: Mayor Al Arreola on Infrastructure, Border Growth, and a City Poised for Its Next Chapter

Del Rio, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Jan 7, 2026 @ 9:00 AM US/Central — In a new audio-only episode of The Building Texas Show, host Justin McKenzie sits down with Al Arreola, Mayor of Del Rio, for a candid, forward-looking conversation about the city’s economic momentum, infrastructure priorities, and the realities—and opportunities—of being a modern Texas border community.

 Recorded in Del Rio, the episode explores how the city is moving beyond national headlines to focus on long-term growth rooted in collaboration, safety, and strategic investment. Mayor Arreola outlines how population stability, inbound relocation from across the country, and strong coordination with state and federal partners are creating renewed confidence in Del Rio’s future

 A cornerstone of Del Rio’s stability is Laughlin Air Force Base, which continues to anchor the local economy and attract highly skilled professionals. Many of those who arrive for military service ultimately choose to stay, drawn by Del Rio’s quality of life, affordability, and deep sense of community.

 The conversation also highlights Del Rio’s growing regional cooperation with Ciudad Acuña, Eagle Pass, and Piedras Negras. Rather than competing, border cities are aligning around shared goals: economic growth, secure ports of entry, and efficient cross-border commerce. Mayor Arreola emphasizes that what impacts one city ultimately impacts the entire region.

 Infrastructure emerges as the defining issue for the years ahead. From water and wastewater capacity to transportation and border crossings, Del Rio is focused on ensuring its systems can support future industry, residents, and trade. A proposed second international bridge—while controversial—represents a long-term investment in mobility, supply chains, and economic resilience.

 Tourism and outdoor recreation remain vital components of the local economy as well. Lake Amistad continues to draw anglers, hunters, and visitors from across Texas, supporting events, hospitality, and seasonal tourism even amid fluctuating water levels.

 Throughout the episode, Mayor Arreola returns to a central theme: Del Rio’s identity as a welcoming, relationship-driven community. From cross-border families and military households to entrepreneurs and visitors passing through, the city’s culture of hospitality remains one of its strongest assets.

 “This is a city built on friendship,” Arreola explains, referencing the enduring meaning of Amistad. “People come here and feel like they belong—and that’s what makes them stay”

 The episode offers listeners a grounded, on-the-record look at how Del Rio is positioning itself for the next decade—focused not on rhetoric, but on infrastructure, cooperation, and measurable growth.
