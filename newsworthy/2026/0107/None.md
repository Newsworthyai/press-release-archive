# Rhug Wild Beauty Introduces a Fresh Start for the New Year with Clean, High-Efficacy Skincare from the UK

Boerne, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Jan 7, 2026 @ 3:00 AM Pacific — As the New Year invites reflection, renewal, and intention, Rhug Wild Beauty offers a refined approach to skincare rooted in nature, science, and sustainability. Drawing on the wild, organic landscape of the Rhug Estate in North Wales, the award-winning luxury British brand presents a collection of clean, high-efficacy formulations designed to restore balance and support long-term skin health.

 Founded on the principle that true beauty begins with wellbeing, Rhug Wild Beauty harnesses wild-foraged and organically grown botanicals, carefully selected for their proven performance. Each product is formulated to deliver visible results while respecting both the skin and the environment — free from unnecessary synthetics, yet uncompromising in efficacy. The range blends estate-grown ingredients with clinically validated natural actives, reflecting a modern approach to clean beauty that performs.

 At the heart of the collection is a commitment to results-led, sustainable skincare. Ingredients are grown and foraged on the Rhug Estate, where regenerative farming and land stewardship ensure traceability, integrity, and exceptional quality. This deep connection to place remains central to the brand’s philosophy: skincare that is as responsible as it is luxurious.

 The New Year also marks a growing presence for Rhug Wild Beauty within the luxury wellness and international skincare space. As the first five-star spa brand partner at Chuan Body + Soul at The Langham, London, Rhug Wild Beauty has been incorporated into exclusive spa treatments that unite Traditional Chinese Medicine–inspired techniques with the brand’s nourishing formulations. Beyond the spa, the brand continues to expand its global reach, with increasing availability in the United States through select luxury retail partners and online platforms.

 New Year resolutions often focus on change,” says Lord Newborough. “At Rhug Wild Beauty, we believe in thoughtful, sustainable rituals — products that work with the skin over time, supporting resilience, radiance, and overall wellbeing.

 Whether experienced as part of a professional spa ritual or a daily at-home routine, Rhug Wild Beauty invites consumers to begin the year with intention — embracing skincare that is clean, effective, and deeply connected to nature.
