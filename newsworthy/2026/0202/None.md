# Ricky Gleason Champions Community-Driven Leadership Model for Kendall County Judge

Comfort, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Feb 2, 2026 @ 12:30 PM Central — As Kendall County faces intensifying growth and public safety challenges, County Judge candidate Ricky Gleason is advocating for a fundamental shift in leadership—one that listens to residents first and treats county government as a partner, not an adversary.

 Gleason points to Comfort Vision 2050, a community-crafted roadmap developed by Comfort residents, as proof that collaborative, ground-up planning works. The plan, created across generations and professions, highlights decentralized decision-making, transparency, and coordination, principles Gleason says must guide county governance.

 “At its best, county government should be a partner to its citizens—not an adversary,” said Gleason. “The County Judge sets the tone. That tone should bring people together, not push them apart.”

 Listening as LeadershipGleason’s platform centers on proactive listening to residents, first responders, businesses, school districts, and municipalities. He believes leadership is about creating conditions where local ideas can thrive, especially in critical areas like:

 * Road & Bridge Planning: Coordinated, long-term infrastructure strategy.
* Emergency Management: Unified response to flash floods and wildfire risks.
* Fire & EMS Services: Strengthening volunteer capacity and interagency trust.
* Economic Development: Fostering growth that preserves community character.

 Why It Matters NowKendall County lacks a unified strategic vision, even as pressures from growth, environmental hazards, and strained infrastructure increase. Gleason argues that the County Judge must convene voices, align partners, and ensure innovation happens with the people, not to them.

 “Leadership starts with service,” Gleason added. “It means listening first, communicating clearly, and remembering that authority exists to help people succeed - not to control them.”

 A Blueprint from ComfortWhile Comfort Vision 2050 is not a county plan, Gleason sees it as a “proof of concept” for engaged, resident-led planning. The process demonstrated that when invited into the conversation, citizens willingly define shared priorities and practical solutions.

 “A unified county is a stronger county,” Gleason stated. “When government works alongside its people, we solve problems faster, make better decisions, and preserve what makes Kendall County special.”
