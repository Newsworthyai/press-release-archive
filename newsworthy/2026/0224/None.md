# ORGANA International: Seasonal Fatigue Awareness Highlights Mineral Deficiency and Winter Energy Support

Springville, UT (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Feb 24, 2026 @ 7:00 AM US/Mountain — As colder weather and reduced daylight affect routines across the country, many individuals report feeling lower energy during winter months. While seasonal changes are often attributed to reduced sunlight and activity levels, conversations around overall nutrition have also increased — including awareness of essential mineral intake.

 ORGANA International, a wellness company specializing in plant-derived trace minerals, is highlighting how modern dietary habits and seasonal lifestyle shifts may leave some individuals falling short on key micronutrients involved in normal cellular function and energy metabolism.

 “Winter is when people become more aware of how they feel day to day,” said Larry Mills, CEO of ORGANA International. “Minerals are foundational nutrients that support hydration, cellular activity, and overall vitality. Our goal is to encourage awareness and provide a convenient way to help maintain consistent mineral intake.”

 The Role of Trace Minerals in Seasonal Energy Support Minerals such as magnesium, potassium, iron, zinc, and others are involved in numerous biological processes related to normal energy production and hydration balance. During colder months, when routines shift and dietary patterns may change, maintaining adequate mineral intake becomes increasingly important.

 Organa Mineral Drink – Pomegranate Flavor provides up to 78 plant-derived trace minerals, combined with naturally occurring fulvic acid, designed to support mineral transport and bioavailability.

 Key Features:

 * 100% plant-derived trace minerals
* Contains fulvic acid to support nutrient transport
* Liquid format designed for efficient absorption
* No fillers, binders, preservatives, or additives
* Processed using RO water with no chemicals or heat extraction

 A Gentle Process Designed to Preserve Integrity ORGANA utilizes a specialized leaching process that avoids chemical solvents and high heat, helping maintain the natural characteristics of the mineral complex. Reverse osmosis (RO) water is used as the extraction medium to preserve purity and nutritional value.

 The pomegranate flavor offers a convenient and pleasant way to incorporate plant-based minerals into a daily routine during winter and throughout the year.

 Seasonal Awareness, Year-Round Wellness As seasonal health awareness grows, ORGANA encourages individuals to consider hydration, balanced nutrition, and mineral intake as part of a comprehensive wellness routine.

 “We’re focused on foundational nutrition,” Mills added. “Maintaining proper mineral intake is a simple but important part of supporting the body’s natural energy systems.”

 Available on Amazon Organa Mineral Drink – Pomegranate Flavor is available on Amazon.com, providing convenient nationwide access for consumers seeking plant-derived mineral supplementation.
