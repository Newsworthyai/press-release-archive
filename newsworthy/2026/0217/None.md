# Be Water Now Available on OneLavi.com

Marion, N.C. (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Feb 17, 2026 @ 6:30 AM America/Phoenix — Greene Concepts Inc. (OTCID: INKW) today announced that Be Water™, its American spring water brand sourced in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, is now available for purchase on OneLavi.com, further expanding consumer access as the brand’s national retail footprint continues to grow.

 Already available through select national retailers including Walmart.com, select Walmart locations, and Camping World, the addition of OneLavi represents another step in making the brand accessible across multiple purchasing channels while maintaining its focus on source stewardship and transparency.

 Unlike much of the bottled water category — where water is heavily processed after collection — Be Water™ begins with geology. The water originates from spring and artesian wells drawing from a naturally replenished aquifer beneath the Blue Ridge Mountains and is bottled at the source in Marion, North Carolina.

 Expanding availability is important, but protecting the source always comes first,” said Lenny Greene, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Greene Concepts Inc. “Our goal is to grow responsibly while maintaining the natural balance that defines the water itself.

 Natural Filtration Through Ancient Bedrock Rainfall in the surrounding mountain watershed infiltrates soil and regolith before entering a network of fractures within crystalline bedrock formed more than one billion years ago during the Grenville geologic era. As water slowly travels through these narrow fractures — often moving only feet per year — rock surfaces physically trap particles while natural ion exchange stabilizes pH and introduces naturally occurring minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and silica.

 The antiquity and stability of the bedrock limit dissolution of unwanted elements and produce a consistent, low-dissolved-solids mineral profile. Long underground residence time allows natural purification processes to occur before the water ever reaches the well, meaning treatment focuses on preservation rather than reconstruction.

 What Defines Be Water™ * American spring water sourced from spring and artesian well systems
* Naturally filtered through ancient Blue Ridge bedrock formed over one billion years ago
* Naturally occurring minerals — calcium, magnesium, and silica — with nothing added back
* Responsible aquifer stewardship, withdrawing only replenishable volumes
* Made in the USA and bottled at the source in Marion, North Carolina
* Premium BPA-free packaging with a durable, intentional feel
* Accessible pricing designed for everyday hydration

 Be Water™ is bottled at Greene Concepts’ owned and operated 60,000-square-foot facility, providing transparency from aquifer to bottle and supporting domestic production. Withdrawal levels are managed to preserve natural pressure and long-term ecological balance of the aquifer system.

 The addition of OneLavi complements existing retail availability while supporting a broader distribution strategy designed to balance accessibility with sustainable source management.

 Where to Purchase Be Water™ Be Water™ is available through select national retailers including select Walmart locations, Walmart.com, Camping World, and now OneLavi.com, with additional retail and e-commerce expansion underway.
