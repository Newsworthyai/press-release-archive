# Tri-Cities WA Home Prices Up 1.2% to 3.6% in 2025

Kennewick, WA (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Jan 30, 2026 @ 11:00 AM US/Pacific — Home prices in the Tri-Cities area recorded moderate gains in 2025, marking the second year of price increases following a market adjustment in 2023, according to data tracked by the Cari McGee Real Estate Team.

 Despite a relatively flat market compared to historical averages, local real estate data shows that all key price measures (median and average) climbed year-over-year, reflecting continued stability and buyer interest in the Tri-Cities housing market.

 Key Highlights from 2025 Home Sales:

 * December 2025 Median Price: The median sales price for homes sold in December 2025 was $424,900, a 1.2% increase compared with December 2024.
* Full-Year Median Price: Across all 3,590 homes sold in 2025, the full-year median sales price was $433,000, up 1.9% from 2024.
* Average Sales Price Record: The average sales price for the Tri-Cities in 2025 reached $479,044, 3.6% higher than 2024 and a new annual record for the area. (The previous high average sales price was $469,760 in 2022.)

 “These gains might seem modest when viewed in isolation, but they indicate healthy market conditions and sustained demand for homes across the immediate Tri-Cities area,” said Cari McGee, local Realtor® and market expert.

 Taken together, the data show that 2025 was a year of steady housing price appreciation for the Tri-Cities market.

 (Important note: When we say “Tri-Cities area,” we mean Kennewick, Pasco, Richland, West Richland, Benton City, and Burbank. The Tri-Cities Association of Realtors’ sales data also includes further outlying areas such as Basin City, Connell, Eltopia, Kahlotus, and others. Sales in those areas are not included in our count.)
