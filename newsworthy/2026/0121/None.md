# Modish Global Signs Global Licensing Deal with SyndiGate

Las Vegas, NV (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Jan 21, 2026 @ 7:00 AM Pacific — Modish Global Inc., a federally recognized Disability-Owned Business Enterprise (DOBE), announced a global content licensing agreement with SyndiGate, expanding institutional access to its proprietary visual-intelligence content across enterprise, professional, and corporate markets worldwide.

 The agreement enables SyndiGate to license Modish Global’s content catalog, including the full archive of 3D Transformative Digest™, an ISSN-registered publication recognized by the U.S. Library of Congress. The Digest features evergreen, rights-managed visual content designed for long-term professional use, positioning Modish Global’s work for integration into corporate communications, training platforms, knowledge systems, and institutional environments.

 Modish Global is the creator of Cinematic Intelligence™, a proprietary design and visualization infrastructure capable of transforming any physical space into 192 hyper-realistic, cinematic 3D renders in under 39 minutes. By automating large-scale spatial expansion while preserving architectural intent, Cinematic Intelligence reduces traditional rendering timelines by up to 92% and production costs by up to 95%, enabling architects, developers, designers, and enterprises to move from concept to deployment at unprecedented speed and scale.

 Unlike impression-based media or short-cycle visualization tools, Modish Global’s content and technology are built for durability, compliance, and reuse. Through established global distribution channels, the company’s work reaches millions of readers across more than 150 countries, including placement in airport lounges, hotels, private terminals, and institutional networks. The SyndiGate partnership extends this reach into enterprise licensing ecosystems where rights governance, longevity, and operational reliability are central requirements.

 Modish Global’s DOBE certification places the company among a limited group of federally recognized enterprises eligible for supplier-diversity procurement initiatives, offering organizations an opportunity to align licensed content acquisition with compliance objectives while accessing advanced visual-intelligence capabilities.

 The company continues to expand its licensing and recognition platforms, including the Cinematic Intelligence Awards™, supporting institutions seeking authoritative, scalable, and future-ready visual content and recognition frameworks.

 About Modish Global Inc. Modish Global Inc. is a DOBE-certified creative technology and publishing company headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada.
