Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers attended the La Crosse event and delivered remarks recognizing Emplify Health’s leadership and commitment to families. A news conference, including Green Bay Mayor Eric Genrich, was held in Green Bay to celebrate the certification.

 In our conversations, Emplify Health was quick to recognize that supporting families not only strengthens their organization — it’s also simply the right thing to do,” said Neil Kline, Executive Director of Family Friendly Workplaces. “Emplify Health is the largest employer to be certified as a Family Friendly Workplace, and we are thrilled that they are leading the way for employersacross Wisconsin. With Emplify Health in the family, 71 employers across Wisconsin have been certified, covering over 24,000 employees and their families.

 Wisconsin’s long-term workforce shortage threatens the state’s economic vibrancy in the years ahead. From now through 2050, Wisconsin’s workforce is expected to shrink before stagnating. This long-term human resources shortage requires a strategic response.
