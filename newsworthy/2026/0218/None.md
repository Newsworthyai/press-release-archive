# Truista Coffee Officially Launches With Doctor-Recommended, Lab-Verified “Clean Coffee” Standard

Newport Beach, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Feb 18, 2026 @ 7:00 AM Eastern — Truista Coffee, an organic coffee brand built on transparency and third-party verification, has officially launched nationwide. The company’s first production release took place on September 29, 2025, National Coffee Day, marking both the public debut of the brand and the birthday of its founder.

 A Journey That Started With One Honest Comment The idea for Truista Coffee began with a blunt moment of honesty.

 After serving his son-in-law a homemade latte, founder Jason Tebeau was told it “sucked.” The comment led to a humbling visit to a café equipped with a La Marzocco espresso machine, where a single cup of microlot espresso sparked a deeper obsession.

 What started as a personal effort to make better coffee quickly evolved into a full immersion in the craft. He moved from experimenting with a vintage La Pavoni espresso machine to studying and becoming a certified barista.

 But the deeper he went into the coffee world, the more concerning information he discovered.

 Scientific research shows that acrylamide forms during the roasting of coffee beans, particularly in the early stages of roasting. Acrylamide is a heat-generated compound classified as a probable human carcinogen based on animal studies.

 Coffee can also contain mycotoxins produced by certain fungi, which have been identified as a global food-safety concern in coffee supply chains.

 As a biohacker, founder of Da Vinci Medical, and creator of the Superhuman Protocol, Tebeau began to question whether conventional coffee truly supported high-performance health.

 Partnering With a World-Renowned Coffee Expert That search led him to Joey Chase, a globally recognized coffee expert with more than two decades of experience sourcing exceptional beans across Central and South America, Africa, and other major coffee-growing regions.

 Chase is the creator of the Chasing Coffee travel series, which documents the global coffee trade from farm to cup. Through years of travel, he built direct relationships with growers and developed expertise in sourcing, processing, and farm-level quality.

 Together, the partners set out to build a different kind of coffee company—one grounded in both craft and science.

 Building a Coffee Designed for Purity The result was Truista Coffee, a brand focused on direct farm sourcing and a proprietary process designed to reduce unwanted compounds while preserving flavor and antioxidants.

 The company’s approach includes:

 * Organic sourcing from trusted farms
* Patent-pending fermentation designed to reduce acrylamide formation
* Pre-roast screening for mold, mycotoxins, heavy metals, pesticides, and herbicides
* Post-roast screening for acrylamide
* Roast profiles engineered to minimize harmful compounds
* Third-party laboratory verification on every production batch

 Every bag of Truista Coffee features a QR code linking directly to batch-specific lab results, providing full transparency for consumers.

 A New Standard for Coffee Transparency Many coffee brands use terms such as “clean,” “mold-free,” or “toxin-free” without providing batch-level lab data. Truista positions itself as an organic coffee brand built around verifiable transparency.

 The company’s philosophy traces back to a lesson from the founder’s father:

 “Whatever you do, do it better than anyone else.”

 That principle shaped Truista into more than just another coffee brand. It became a mission to deliver purity, precision, and accountability in every cup.
