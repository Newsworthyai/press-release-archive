# Oscar Salinas Highlights DA Role in Bexar County Amidst Growing Caseloads

San Antonio, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Feb 24, 2026 @ 8:05 PM Central — In a recent interview on Vote Like a Texan, Oscar Salinas, a Democratic candidate for Bexar County District Attorney, outlined the complex responsibilities of leading a $57 million office handling 10,000 new felony cases each year, while emphasizing fairness, resource management, and community collaboration.

 A $57M Office with 10,000 New Felony Cases AnnuallyThe Bexar County District Attorney’s Office manages a $57 million budget and 560 employees, including 260 prosecutors. With a 27% population growth over the past 12 years and evidence-heavy caseloads—including body cam footage—the office faces significant challenges in prioritizing resources and reducing backlogs.

 “We need to make sure we are using our resources to the best of our ability,” said Salinas. “Not every case is a life sentence case. 98% of defendants will at some point return to the community. We must focus on prosecuting violent offenders while ensuring redeemable individuals can become productive members of society.”

 Addressing Backlogs and Prioritizing Violent CrimeSalinas emphasized the need to streamline case management, particularly in family violence and non-violent offense categories, to ensure violent crimes receive the attention they require. He advocates for clear timelines, consistent communication with complainants, and strategic collaboration with law enforcement and community partners.

 “We have a no-drop policy, but if we cannot prove a case beyond a reasonable doubt, we should not be holding on to it. We need to focus on the cases we can prove.” – Oscar Salinas
