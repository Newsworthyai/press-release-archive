# Woodstock Adds Two New 10mg Flavors to their Line of Cannabis-Infused Functional Beverages

Somerville, MA (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Feb 25, 2026 @ 8:00 AM US/Eastern — Woodstock Goods, the hemp THC beverage brand rooted in the legacy of the iconic 1969 Woodstock Festival, announced the launch of two new 10mg SKUs — Cherry Pomelo and Salted Melon — expanding its line of functional, mood-based seltzers to meet growing consumer demand for a higher-dose option.

 * Cherry Pomelo ("Drift") combines 10mg THC, 10mg CBD, and 100mg L-Theanine for a calming, restorative effect
* Salted Melon ("Bliss") pairs 10mg THC, 10mg CBG, and 100mg Lion's Mane extract for mental clarity and an elevated headspace

 What sets Woodstock apart from the growing field of hemp seltzers isn't just the dose range — it's the formulation depth. Every SKU is crafted with a proprietary blend of minor cannabinoids (CBD, CBG, CBN, CBC) and functional botanicals including Lion's Mane, Reishi, Cordyceps, and L-Theanine, delivering targeted mood-based benefits that go well beyond a standard THC beverage. All Woodstock Goods' drinks are made with organic fruit juices and organic cane sugar, positioned as a better-for-you alternative to alcohol with fast onset, clean offset, and zero hangover.

 The new flavors join Woodstock's existing lineup of four SKUs across 2.5mg and 5mg formulations: Citrus Spritz ("Laugh"), Yuzu Ginger ("Chill"), Raspberry Lychee ("Solace"), and Dark Berries ("Dream"). Together, the full six-flavor collection offers something for every tolerance level and occasion — from a light social lift to deep relaxation and sleep support.

 The new 10mg SKUs are available now at $17.99/4-pk at woodstockgoods.com and will be available through select specialty retailers across Illinois, Tennessee, New Jersey, Connecticut, Ohio, and Missouri/Kansas. To celebrate the launch, Woodstock is offering 25% off all 10mg SKUs through the end of March.
