# Now Open: The 2026 EmployE Employee Experience Benchmark Research and Award Program

San Francisco, CA (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Jan 13, 2026 @ 7:00 AM Pacific — Survale, the leading provider of talent feedback and experience management solutions, today announced the launch of the 2026 EmployE Employee Experience Benchmark Research and Award Program. Building on the 15-year success of the Candidate Experience (CandE) Benchmark Research and Award Program, the new "EmployEs" offer organizations a confidential, comparative, and data-driven approach to measuring and optimizing their employee experience.

 Unlike other programs designed to provide a badge and tout the employer’s workplace, the EmployE program is designed to provide employers with a comprehensive look at what their workforce is really thinking. By utilizing Survale’s time-tested methodology, participating organizations can benchmark their internal engagement, retention, and satisfaction data against a global standard of peers, moving beyond simple surveys to actionable intelligence.

 "The launch of the EmployE Benchmark Research and Award Program represents a natural evolution for Survale and the industry at large," said Jason Moreau, CEO of Survale. "For years, the CandEs have set the standard for candidate experience. Now, we are applying that same rigor to the employee journey. The EmployEs give HR leaders the validated data they need to build world-class workplaces, improve retention, and strengthen their employer brand from the inside out."

 Key Features of the 2026 EmployE Program: * Comprehensive Benchmarking at an Accessible Price: Organizations survey their employees using Survale’s proven guidelines to gather confidential feedback across the entire employee lifecycle—from new hires to long-term team members.
* Actionable Insights: Participants receive a detailed report and a one-on-one consultation with employee experience experts to pinpoint strengths and identify opportunities for growth.
* Brand Amplification: The program features Survale’s exclusive Promote capability, which identifies highly satisfied employees and automatically guides them to leave positive reviews on sites like Glassdoor and Indeed, directly boosting the employer brand.
* Deep Dive Data: The research goes beyond surface-level metrics to measure attitudes on Growth and Development, Engagement, Internal Mobility, and Manager Experience. All linking employee experience metrics to key trends and business outcomes

 Understanding the employee experience is no longer optional; it is a critical business imperative," said Kevin Grossman, VP of Research at Survale. "The EmployEs provide a unique opportunity for companies to see the impact of their employee experience on their business, as well as exactly how they stack up against the competition and to celebrate their successes. We are thrilled to bring this level of insight and recognition to the employee experience landscape.

 Registration for the 2026 EmployE Employee Experience Benchmark Research and Award Program is now open. Organizations interested in participating can learn more and request information here.
