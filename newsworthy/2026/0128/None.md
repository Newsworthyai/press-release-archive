# JC Taylor Announces Candidacy for Kendall County Commissioner, Precinct 2 Local Business Leader Calls on Voters to Participate in the March 3 Rep

Kendall County, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Jan 28, 2026 @ 7:00 AM Central — 

 polJC Taylor, a lifelong Kendall County resident and local business leader, has officially announced his candidacy for Kendall County Commissioner, Precinct 2, urging voters to make their voices heard in the March 3 Republican Primary, the election expected to determine the future of county leadership.

 With early voting beginning February 17, Taylor says the primary election is the most important opportunity for Kendall County residents to influence local government, infrastructure, and public safety decisions.

 “I’ve lived here my entire life,” Taylor said. “I’ve watched Kendall County grow, and I believe now is the time to step up and help guide that growth while protecting our quality of life.”

 A Platform Focused on Planning, Infrastructure, and Public Safety Taylor is running on a platform built around three core priorities: long-term strategic planning, roads and water infrastructure, and fire protection and public safety.

 If elected, Taylor says his first priority will be implementing a five-year strategic plan for Kendall County, providing transparency, accountability, and a clear roadmap for the county’s future.

 “Kendall County does not currently operate with a strategic plan,” Taylor said. “That makes it harder to plan infrastructure, coordinate with cities, and communicate long-term goals to residents.”

 As growth accelerates across Precinct 2, Taylor emphasizes the need to responsibly manage development while protecting water resources and rural character. He points to recent county actions increasing minimum well lot sizes as an example of how county leadership can shape development outcomes, even without zoning authority.

 Addressing Roads, Growth, and Traffic Safety Road safety and traffic congestion — particularly along State Highway 46 and FM 3351 — are major concerns for residents of Precinct 2. Taylor says infrastructure planning must keep pace with both residential and commercial growth.

 “Economic development is important, but it has consequences,” Taylor said. “When new businesses and neighborhoods come in, we must also plan for traffic flow, road safety, and emergency access.”

 Long-Term Solutions for Fire Protection Large portions of Precinct 2 rely on volunteer fire departments, including the Bergheim area and Cordillera. Taylor supports conducting a countywide fire protection study to evaluate long-term funding, coverage needs, and future population growth.

 “We can’t rely on short-term fixes,” Taylor said. “We need sustainable, long-term solutions that reflect how Kendall County will look five, ten, and fifteen years from now.”

 Supporting Local Business and Keeping Families in Kendall County Coming from a family that owns and operates a Kendall County-based business, Taylor describes himself as pro-business and pro-community. He believes responsible economic development is essential to keeping young families, workers, and entrepreneurs in the county.

 “If we want our kids to build their future here, we have to create opportunities for them to live and work here,” Taylor said. “That requires planning, infrastructure, and leadership that thinks long-term.”

 Why the March 3rd Primary Matters Taylor is running in the Republican Primary, which historically determines the outcome of Kendall County commissioner races. With few Democratic challengers expected, the March 3 primary is the decisive election for Precinct 2 voters.

 “Local elections are decided in the primary,” Taylor said. “If you want a say in Kendall County’s future, you need to vote in March.”

 Early voting runs February 17–27, with Election Day on March 3.
