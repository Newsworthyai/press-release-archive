# Candidate Gleason Presents Property Rights-Focused Plan for Kendall County

Boerne, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Feb 11, 2026 @ 1:20 PM Central — BOERNE, Texas – Ricky Gleason, candidate for Kendall County Judge, today unveiled a practical, three-horizon planning framework designed to guide the county’s growth while respecting property rights and ensuring transparency. The approach emphasizes structured, ongoing collaboration over reactive or top-down mandates.

 “Planning only matters if it guides how we prioritize resources and taxpayer dollars,” Gleason added. “The goal is clarity, coordination, and decisions that respect property rights and protect our quality of life.”

 A Framework Built for Clarity & ActionGleason’s model organizes planning into three actionable phases:

 * 0–3 Years: Operational Fixes – Address immediate safety, mobility, and emergency response needs based on verified conditions, avoiding unnecessary regulation.
* 3–10 Years: Capital Alignment – Sequence infrastructure investments—especially where mobility and water intersect—to prevent costly taxpayer mistakes.
* 10–25 Years: Scenario Planning – Engage citizens in shaping long-range water sustainability and growth patterns through input-driven, flexible guidance.

 “Good planning isn’t about controlling land or telling people what they can’t do,” said Gleason. “It’s about structuring a process that protects property rights while ensuring growth, infrastructure, and public safety are handled responsibly.”

 Planning as a Tool, Not a ControlCentral to Gleason’s approach is using planning to guide - not dictate - outcomes. By engaging landowners early during subdivision or project proposals, the county can collaborate on solutions rather than resorting to reactive measures like eminent domain.

 “The county should not be in the business of taking land or dictating outcomes,” Gleason emphasized. “Our best planning opportunities happen early, working with property owners to avoid heavy-handed solutions later.”

 Local Leadership Before Regional PartnershipGleason stressed that Kendall County must lead its own planning efforts before engaging regional or state partners. “If we don’t come to the table with our own plan, someone else will plan for us,” he said. “Residents want leadership that does the work locally first, then partners regionally to support that vision.”

 Why This Matters for Kendall CountyWith rapid growth straining roads, water resources, and emergency services, Gleason’s framework aims to replace short-term fixes with a coordinated, long-term strategy that:

 * Protects property rights and reduces regulatory overreach.
* Involves citizens, first responders, and experts in decision-making.
* Aligns infrastructure spending with realistic growth projections.
* Safeguards water sustainability and rural character.
