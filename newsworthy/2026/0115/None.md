# The Building Texas Show Explores the Future of League City with Mayor Nick Long

League City, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Jan 15, 2026 @ 11:00 AM US/Central — Growth, Infrastructure, Quality of Life, and Why One of Texas’ Fastest-Growing Cities Is Still Flying Under the RadarIn a new episode of The Building Texas Show, host Justin McKenzie sits down with Nick Long, Mayor of League City, for an in-depth conversation about one of Texas’ most dynamic — and often overlooked — cities. Located between Houston, the ports of the Gulf Coast, and the heart of the nation’s aerospace industry, League City is rapidly evolving from a quiet suburban community into a strategic hub for growth, commerce, and quality of life.

 Mayor Long, a lifelong League City resident with over 12 years of service on city council and as mayor, shares a candid look at what it takes to manage explosive growth responsibly. Once home to roughly 30,000 residents, League City now exceeds 125,000 people and is projected to surpass 200,000 within the next decade. That kind of growth, Long explains, demands disciplined planning, fiscal restraint, and regional collaboration.

 A central theme of the episode is League City’s approach to taxation and development. Rather than leaning on rising property values, the city has focused on lowering the property tax burden in real dollars by pursuing the “no new revenue” tax rate and diversifying revenue streams. Sales tax growth, online commerce, and development that pays its own way have allowed the city to invest in infrastructure without shifting costs onto residents.

 The conversation also explores League City’s unique geographic advantage. Positioned near NASA and the Johnson Space Center, bordered by Clear Lake and Galveston Bay, and soon to be directly connected by the Grand Parkway, League City sits at the intersection of aerospace, maritime commerce, and lifestyle-driven relocation. Mayor Long details how the Grand Parkway will connect the ports of Houston, Galveston, and Freeport — opening new opportunities for light industrial development and economic diversification.

 Beyond economics, the episode highlights League City’s lifestyle appeal. From boating and sailing in one of the largest recreational marina systems in the country, to leveraging cruise tourism flowing down I-45, to signature community events like Holiday in the Park, the city is quietly positioning itself as a place where residents can “live where they vacation.”

 Throughout the discussion, transparency and long-term planning emerge as defining values. Mayor Long emphasizes the city’s commitment to publishing master plans, infrastructure studies, and executive summaries that help residents understand how League City is preparing for its future — from water systems and drainage to west-side development and transportation.

 This episode of The Building Texas Show offers viewers a rare, behind-the-scenes look at how local leadership, regional cooperation, and disciplined growth strategies are shaping one of Texas’ most promising cities.
