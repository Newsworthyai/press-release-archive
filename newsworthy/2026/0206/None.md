# Lionheart Health and Rejuvant Partner to Compete in XPRIZE Healthspan Semi-Finals

Huntington Beach, California (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Feb 6, 2026 @ 7:00 AM Pacific — Lionheart Health, a regenerative health and longevity technology company, today announced a strategic partnership with Rejuvant, the developer of the patented, sustained-release Calcium alpha-ketoglutarate (CaAKG) supplementation, as part of Lionheart Health’s participation in the XPRIZE Healthspan Semi-Finals. Lionheart Health was selected as a top 40 semi-finalists out of more than 600 entries in spring 2025.

 Under the collaboration, Rejuvant’s CaAKG supplement—associated with peer-reviewed research demonstrating improvements in biological age markers—has been designated a mandatory core component of the Lionheart KLOTHO-UP™ Study and the broader Lionheart Klotho Wellness Program, both of which are central to Lionheart’s XPRIZE Healthspan initiative.

 A Comprehensive, Technology-Driven Healthspan Platform The Lionheart KLOTHO-UP™ Study integrates Rejuvant’s CaAKG supplementation within a multi-modal healthspan optimization framework designed to evaluate coordinated improvements across muscle, metabolic, immune, cardiovascular, and brain health domains.

 In addition to Rejuvant CaAKG, all study participants receive:

 * SNiP Nutrition™ personalized supplements, customized based on genetic and biomarker profiles
* Targeted Klotho-focused supplementation
* Lionheart Health’s BodStim™ bioelectric exercise platform, delivering Klotho- and follistatin-elevating electrical muscle stimulation–enhanced exercise sessions (1 hour, 2–3 times per week)

 This integrated approach reflects Lionheart’s belief that meaningful healthspan extension requires both lifestyle optimization and advanced biological technologies working in concert.

 Deep, Longitudinal Measurement of Healthspan Outcomes All enrollees in the KLOTHO-UP™ Study and Klotho Wellness Program undergo an extensive testing and evaluation protocol at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months, including:

 * 461-biomarker comprehensive blood panel including klotho levels
* AI-enhanced full-body MRI, with targeted organ and tissue analysis OPTIONAL
* Muscle health - grip strength, 6 minute walk, muscle mass index, gait speed
* Gut health, immunity strength and microbiome assessment
* Breathing and sleep analysis OPTIONAL
* Stress and inflammation profiling, including cortisol measurement OPTIONAL
* Blood sugar and metabolic regulation analysis
* Vascular and calcification assessment OPTIONAL
* Joint health and mobility evaluation OPTIONAL
* Sexual health assessment OPTIONAL
* Vision and hearing evaluation OPTIONAL
* Brain health testing, including cognition, memory, and mood metrics

 This longitudinal design enables objective tracking of functional healthspan changes over time rather than reliance on single-endpoint or short-duration outcomes.
