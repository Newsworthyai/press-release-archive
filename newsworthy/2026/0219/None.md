# South African Wellness Brand The Harvest Table to Bring Clean Collagen and Plant-Based Nutrition to the U.S.

Boca Raton, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Feb 19, 2026 @ 12:10 PM America/Phoenix — The Harvest Table, a family-run South African wellness company, has announced plans to enter the U.S. market, introducing its clean-label, whole-food nutrition products to American consumers.

 Founded by Catherine Clark and rooted in a mission to support everyday wellbeing through nutrient-dense nutrition, The Harvest Table has built a strong following in South Africa by producing supplements made without added fillers, preservatives, artificial flavors, or dyes.

 Products Planned for the U.S. Market The initial U.S. lineup is expected to include:

 * Bovine Collagen Granules 350 g (12.3 oz) Pouch
* Multi Collagen Granules 350 g (12.3 oz) Pouch
* Multi Collagen Radiance 350 g (12.3 oz) Pouch
* Vegan Protein Powder 550 g (19.4 oz) Pouch

 A Thoughtful Approach to Everyday Nutrition Rather than building products around trends or complicated routines, The Harvest Table developed its range to be simple, consistent, and easy to integrate into daily life.

 The brand focuses on clean, recognizable ingredients and straightforward formulations that support regular use. This approach has helped the company build a loyal customer base in South Africa among consumers seeking dependable wellness products they can use long term.

 Founder Catherine Clark began developing the formulations after struggling to find transparent, nutrient-dense options aligned with her own health priorities. What began as small batches prepared for family and friends evolved into a full manufacturing operation centered on ingredient integrity and consistency.

 Designed for Everyday Wellbeing Across the entire range, The Harvest Table products are designed to:

 * Nourish daily wellbeing, not treat or cure medical conditions
* Support foundational systems including gut health, joint mobility, skin integrity, and energy
* Deliver highly bioavailable nutrients that help support long-term vitality

 The products are designed for everyday use, supporting wellbeing through clean, food-based nutrition.

 Manufacturing Standards & Quality Controls All The Harvest Table products are manufactured in-house in a custom-built facility in South Africa that:

 * Passes annual Food Safety Assessment (FSA) audits
* Meets GMP requirements
* Is recognized as a Food Safe Facility
* Is Halaal-certified by the Muslim Judicial Council (MJC)

 Product Attributes & Certifications * Products entering the U.S. market are gluten-free and biodegradable, and export products are Halaal-certified at the product level by the National Independent Halaal Trust (NIHT).
* Sustainability is emphasized through recyclable packaging and responsible manufacturing practices

 A Values-Led Approach to Wellness The Harvest Table takes a deliberate, in-house approach to wellness, maintaining full control over sourcing, formulation, and quality. The brand uses premium, globally sourced ingredients and produces supplements without fillers, artificial additives, or unnecessary complexity.

 Rather than chasing trends, The Harvest Table focuses on minimalist, science-informed formulations designed for bioavailability, consistency, and real-world use.

 "Our philosophy has always been simple,” said Catherine Clark, Founder of The Harvest Table. “Good nutrition should be honest, effective, and easy to trust. Everything we create is designed to support everyday wellbeing using clean ingredients and thoughtful formulation."

 “From sourcing and formulation to manufacturing and quality control, we believe doing things the right way matters,” said Sam Clark, CEO of The Harvest Table. “By keeping production in-house and staying true to our values, we’re able to deliver products that are consistent, transparent, and aligned with what today’s consumers expect from a wellness brand.”
