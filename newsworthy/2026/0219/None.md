# Gener8tor Expands in Texas with Skills Training &amp; Round Rock Hub

Round Rock, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Feb 19, 2026 @ 7:00 AM US/Central — Gener8tor, one of the largest startup accelerators and venture funds in the United States, is deepening its investment in Texas’ entrepreneurial landscape through strategic community partnerships and its accessible training platform, Gener8tor Skills. In a recent interview on The Building Texas Show, Robert Pieroni, Gener8tor’s expansion lead for Texas and Europe, outlined the organization’s mission to foster local innovation and retain talent across the state.

 Building Local Economies Through “Economic Gardening”Gener8tor’s approach centers on economic gardening, investing in local founders to drive organic growth and attract outside capital. In Round Rock, Gener8tor partners with the Chamber of Commerce and the city’s economic development agency to create a hub where entrepreneurs can access mentorship, funding, and peer networks.

 “When a startup gets funded by an angel or venture fund from outside the community, it brings in new capital investment,” said Pieroni. “That’s how you create jobs and lasting impact right where people live.”

 Unlocking Opportunity with Gener8tor SkillsFor aspiring entrepreneurs and career-changers across Texas, Gener8tor Skills offers a practical pathway into high-growth fields. The platform provides on-demand, industry-aligned training in areas such as technology, healthcare, and advanced manufacturing—key sectors driving the state’s economy.

 “Talent is everywhere, but opportunity isn’t always,” Pieroni noted. “Gener8tor Skills helps bridge that gap, equipping Texans with the tools to innovate, lead, and build the future right here at home.”

 A Track Record of ImpactWith 13 years of experience, Gener8tor has a proven model for long-term economic development. To date, the organization has supported 541 startups, which have gone on to raise $1.15 billion in follow-on financing and create over 6,760 jobs.

 “These compounding effects take time, but they transform communities,” Pieroni explained. “We’re here to help cities invest in their best and brightest—today and for the next decade.”

 Looking Ahead: Regional Collaboration & Industry ClustersPieroni emphasized the power of regional collaboration, citing examples like West Texas’ energy cluster and the growing aerospace corridor spanning El Paso, Van Horn, and Brownsville.

 “When communities work together, they can create world-class industry clusters that attract talent, investment, and innovation,” he said. “Texas is already a model for this—and we’re just getting started.”
