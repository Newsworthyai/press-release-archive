# January 2026 Biohacking Index Report Introduces an Invite-Only Expert Model

New York (Newsworthy.ai) Wednesday Feb 4, 2026 @ 8:00 AM Eastern — The January 2026 Report represents the first physician-curated, invite-only edition of the Biohacking Index report, reinforcing the platform’s core principle that credibility, not sponsorship or popularity, should determine visibility in the wellness and biohacking ecosystem.

 The Biohacking Index evaluates companies based on transparency, documentation, and real-world clinical relevance. Verification is optional and reserved for Premium Members of the Biohacking Index.

 An Invite-Only Expert and Provider Model In addition to company verification, the Biohacking Index now operates an invite-only membership for clinicians and expert providers. Physicians are selected based on clinical experience, patient outcomes, professional reputation, and alignment with evidence-based, forward-thinking care.

 Invited experts may nominate wellness technologies, diagnostics, or nutraceuticals they actively use or recommend. They may also nominate their own solutions, provided those products complete the full Biohacking Index verification process. Expert members receive enhanced professional profiles, SEO and large language model training benefits, and lead generation capabilities within the platform.

 Nomination does not guarantee inclusion. Verification remains optional, but credibility remains the standard.

 January 2026 Verified Companies The following companies completed verification and earned placement in the January 2026 Biohacking Index:

 * Da Vinci Medical, a manufacturer of advanced recovery and wellness technologies used in clinical and performance settings - including the SUPERHUMAN Protocol.
* Lumati, a light-based wellness technology company focused on cellular signaling and recovery.
* Truista Coffee, a functional coffee company emphasizing contaminant transparency, sourcing, and guaranteed third-party Lab testing on every package.

 Each company met Biohacking Index standards for transparency, documentation, and practitioner relevance.

 Physician Curation and Transparency Dr. Lipman, founder of Physical Evidence Chiropractic in Boca Raton, Florida, is known for integrating advanced diagnostics, regenerative therapies, and recovery technologies into patient care. With more than 100 five-star patient reviews and recognition as a Top 10 Provider in the 2025 Biohacking Index Report, his nominations reflect tools used in active clinical practice rather than theoretical or consumer-driven trends.

 Several additional companies were nominated as part of the curation process but elected not to pursue verification at this time. These nominations remain visible to reflect practitioner awareness while maintaining transparency around verification status.

 A Signal for the Industry The January 2026 report signals a broader shift in the wellness and longevity industry toward expert-led evaluation, voluntary verification, and clear separation between recommendation and endorsement.

 Being recommended is not the same as being verified. And verification remains an open door, not a requirement.
