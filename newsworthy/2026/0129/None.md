# Whoopi Goldberg Will Take the Stage for a Candid Conversation on Cannabis: New Jersey, Feb. 10 at IgniteIt’s Market Spotlight

Jersey City, NJ (Newsworthy.ai) Thursday Jan 29, 2026 @ 8:06 AM Central — IgniteIt, a media and events platform focused on emerging and regulated markets, today announced that Whoopi Goldberg will headline its upcoming Market Spotlight: New Jersey conference on February 10, 2026, at The Westin Jersey City Newport.

 Goldberg, along with business associates Davina Kaonohi & Melissa Jochim, Founding Partners of Beauty Evolution, will take the stage from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM for an exclusive, live, 30-minute moderated conversation exploring the intersection of culture, wellness, and entrepreneurship. The session will touch on Goldberg’s personal wellness journey, the evolution and strategy behind WhoopFam’s new wellness line, and how cannabis is increasingly shaping mainstream consumer conversations.

 The discussion will be moderated by New Jersey attorney and longtime IgniteIt collaborator Lou Magazzu, and is expected to be one of the conference’s most anticipated sessions.

 Goldberg has been an outspoken advocate for accessible, responsibly produced cannabis. Through WhoopFam’s new wellness line, she continues to push for education, normalization, and thoughtful product innovation in a rapidly evolving market.

 Having spoken with Whoopi about cannabis extensively a few years ago, what stayed with me is how genuine it is for her,” said Javier Hasse, co-founder of IgniteIt. “This isn’t a trend or a talking point. She’s been thinking about this plant, and talking about it, long before it was widely accepted.

 “Whoopi Goldberg is one of the most influential cultural voices of our time,” added Elliot Lane, President of IgniteIt. “Her perspective on wellness, business, and the evolution of cannabis resonates far beyond this industry. This conversation reflects exactly what Market Spotlight is about—real stories, real experience, and honest dialogue about where this market is headed.”

 Market Spotlight: New Jersey will convene leading multi-state operators, New Jersey license holders, investors, and industry stakeholders for a full day of deal-making, market intelligence, and strategic networking.
