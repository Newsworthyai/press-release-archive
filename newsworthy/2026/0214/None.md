# Alpine Mayor Eaves Shares Vision for West Texas Growth on Building Texas Show

Alpine, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Saturday Feb 14, 2026 @ 10:15 AM US/Central — In an exclusive interview on The Building Texas Show, Mayor Catherine Eaves of Alpine, Texas, detailed the city’s unique blend of historic preservation, educational excellence and proactive governance in the heart of West Texas’s Big Bend region.

 “We're not just growing, we're growing thoughtfully. From infrastructure to housing, we're making decisions that support both current residents and future generations," said Alpine Mayor Catherine Eaves

 From Educator to Mayor: A Civic JourneyA retired 25-year science educator and professor with Lone Star College, Mayor Eaves moved to Alpine full-time in 2021 and quickly immersed herself in the community. Recognizing a need for greater civic engagement, she launched a door-to-door campaign and was elected mayor in 2022.

 “I wanted to educate people and get them involved in their government,” Eaves said. She even created “City Government 101” classes at City Hall to demystify local governance for residents.

 Education as a CornerstoneAlpine’s identity is deeply tied to Sul Ross State University, which fuels local innovation through its nursing program, law enforcement academy, and wildlife management degrees. The university also houses the Museum of the Big Bend, home to a world-class map collection. Eaves emphasized how educational partnerships - including remote learning with Lone Star College- are building a skilled workforce and supporting rural healthcare needs.

 Addressing Rural EMS ChallengesA pressing issue discussed was the upcoming expiration of the city’s contract for emergency services. Eaves outlined collaborative solutions being explored with Brewster County, including the potential formation of an Emergency Services District (ESD) to ensure reliable emergency care for Alpine’s growing retiree population.

 “We’re leaning on each other,” she said, highlighting monthly leadership huddles with county, school, and university officials.

 Economic Growth & “Dark Sky” BrandingAlpine is experiencing a business boom, with new restaurants, retail stores, and nurseries opening downtown. The city was recently approved as a Historic Downtown District and is rebranding as the “Dark Sky Capital of Texas” to attract astrotourism. Landmarks like Kokernot Field - a historic baseball stadium - and partnerships with Amtrak are enhancing Alpine’s appeal as a destination.

 Community Storytelling Through PodcastingMayor Eaves also hosts “Small Town Big Stories,” a podcast preserving Alpine’s oral history. With nearly 100 interviews featuring multi-generational residents, the show archives pioneer stories for future generations and is available on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.
