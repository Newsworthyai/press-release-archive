# ORGANA Highlights Essiac Tea as a Time-Honored Herbal Formula for Immune Support and Whole-Body Wellness

Springville, UT (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Jan 27, 2026 @ 7:00 AM US/Mountain — ORGANA International today announced renewed attention on one of its most enduring wellness products: Organa Essiac Tea, a liquid herbal blend designed to nourish the body, support immune function, and promote natural cleansing as part of a holistic daily routine.

 Used by wellness-minded individuals around the world, Essiac Tea has a long history as a plant-based formula valued for its restorative properties. ORGANA’s version builds on that tradition with a carefully crafted blend of five botanicals, delivered in a convenient liquid format.

 “Essiac Tea has been trusted for generations as a gentle way to support the body,” said Larry Mills, CEO of ORGANA International. “Our goal is to offer a clean, thoughtfully prepared formula that fits modern lifestyles while honoring the integrity of the original botanicals.”

 Five Botanicals, One Holistic Formula Organa Essiac Tea is made from a blend of five carefully selected herbs, each chosen for its traditional role in supporting overall wellness:

 * Burdock Root – Rich in protein and vitamins A, C, K, E, and B-complex, along with naturally occurring minerals
* Sheep Sorrel – Contains calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, and zinc
* Cat’s Claw Bark – Traditionally used to support a healthy immune system
* Slippery Elm (inner bark) – A source of minerals including calcium, magnesium, manganese, iron, and potassium, plus vitamins C and D
* Turkish (Indian) Rhubarb – Contains vitamins A, B, and C, along with minerals such as calcium and copper

 Together, these botanicals work synergistically to nourish the body, support immune function, encourage gentle detoxification, and help restore natural energy levels.

 Liquid Convenience, Traditional Integrity Unlike traditional brewed teas, Organa Essiac Tea is offered in a ready-to-use liquid form, making it easy to incorporate into daily wellness routines at home or on the go. The liquid format is designed for consistency, convenience, and ease of use — without the need for preparation or steeping.

 Organa’s Essiac Tea is crafted with a focus on purity and quality, using carefully sourced herbs and a process designed to preserve their natural characteristics.

 A Trusted Choice for Everyday Wellness Organa Essiac Tea has earned positive reviews from wellness consumers seeking a plant-based supplement to complement their overall health regimen. Many incorporate it into their routines for general well-being, immune support, and as part of periodic detox practices.

 Success for us is when customers feel better supported in their daily health,” Mills added. “Essiac Tea is one of those products that people return to again and again.
