# Central Texas Angel Network Spotlighted on The Building Texas Show for Statewide Impact on Startup Investment

Austin, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Sunday Jan 11, 2026 @ 6:57 AM US/Central — The role of angel investors in shaping Texas’ entrepreneurial future takes center stage in a new episode of The Building Texas Show, featuring Gary Forni, Chairman of the Central Texas Angel Network (CTAN).

 The episode delivers a rare, in-depth look at how one of Texas’ most established angel networks evaluates, funds, and supports early-stage companies—not just in Austin, but across the state and beyond. Through a candid conversation with host Justin McKenzie, Forni demystifies angel investing while underscoring the discipline, governance, and collaboration required to build sustainable startup ecosystems.

 Unlike venture capital firms, angel investors deploy their own capital, often bringing decades of operational experience, industry expertise, and mentorship into the companies they back. CTAN exemplifies this model through a structured, repeatable investment process that reviews hundreds of startups annually, ultimately investing in just a small fraction that meet rigorous criteria for scalability, leadership, and market opportunity.

 The discussion highlights CTAN’s distributed approach, including partnerships with emerging communities such as Abilene, and its leadership role in statewide syndication efforts that allow angel groups to collaborate rather than compete. This model expands access to capital for founders while giving investors exposure to high-quality deal flow across geographies.

 Beyond capital, the episode emphasizes CTAN’s broader mission: education, mentorship, and ecosystem development. From angel education programs to university engagement, pitch competitions, and founder feedback forums, the network plays a critical role in preparing entrepreneurs to succeed—whether or not they receive immediate funding.

 As Texas continues to diversify its economy and extend innovation beyond major metros, the insights shared in this episode offer a practical blueprint for how communities can align investors, founders, institutions, and local leaders around long-term growth.

 The full episode is now available on YouTube and major podcast platforms. Be sure to catch Gary when he speaks at SXSW this year.
