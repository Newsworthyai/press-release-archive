# New Book "Furry Mortals: The Oliver Project" Offers Shared Wisdom for Pet End-of-Life

Houston, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Feb 13, 2026 @ 11:05 AM US/Central — Every year, millions of pet owners face the agonizing "limbo" of end-of-life care—a period marked by difficult medical decisions, anticipatory grief, and the looming weight of a final goodbye. In her new book, Furry Mortals: The Oliver Project, author Angela Human provides a much-needed bridge between the professional world of end-of-life logistics and the raw, personal heart of a pet parent.

 Inspired by the loss of her beloved pet, Oliver, Angela brings a unique perspective to the subject. As a veteran of the deathcare industry, she has spent decades navigating the intersection of technology and memorialization. When faced with Oliver’s decline, she realized that even with her professional background, the emotional and practical hurdles of pet loss were overwhelming.

 “In the funeral industry, we talk about preparation and legacy every day,” says Angela. “But when it was my own pet—my Oliver—I realized there was a silent struggle pet owners face. We need more than just clinical advice; we need a roadmap that honors the bond while managing the reality of the end.”

 The Power of Shared Experience Furry Mortals: The Oliver Project moves beyond traditional manuals by weaving together expert palliative advice with a collection of poignant stories from pet parents who have walked this road. These narratives provide a raw, honest look at the diverse ways people navigate loss, ensuring readers never feel alone in their decisions.

 “Loss is universal, but the path through it is deeply personal,” Angela explains. “By sharing these stories alongside practical guidance, I wanted to create a space where pet parents feel seen, heard, and supported by a tribe of people who truly 'get it.'”

 Key Takeaways from the Book:

 * Navigating the "Limbo": Strategies for managing the anticipatory grief that occurs as a pet's health declines.
* The Decision-Making Framework: A grounded approach to the ethics and logistics of end-of-life choices.
* The Community Tribe: Real-world anecdotes that offer comfort and perspective on the human-animal bond.
* Legacy Building: Practical ways to honor a pet’s life and process grief through meaningful action.

 Take the First Step Toward Peace The book has already resonated with pet owners seeking a grounded, sincere voice in a space that is often either too clinical or overly sentimental. Furry Mortals: The Oliver Project and it's companion guide, The Furry Mortals Compass, is available now at www.FurryMortals.com & on Amazon.

 About the Author After decades on the "human side" of deathcare, Angela has expanded her advocacy to animal companions. Furry Mortals: The Oliver Project is the culmination of her professional expertise and personal experience with grief. She is a member of IAAHPC and APLB, an accomplished public speaker, and a proud dog and cat mom who spends her time between Houston, TX, and Marshfield, MA.
