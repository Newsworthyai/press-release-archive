# Joseph Kopser Announces Candidacy for Texas House District 47

Austin, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Jan 12, 2026 @ 9:15 AM Central — Joseph Kopser, a decorated Army veteran, successful technology entrepreneur, and lifelong problem solver, today announced his candidacy for the Texas House of Representatives in District 47. Running as a Democrat, Kopser is committed to breaking through partisan gridlock, challenging the status quo, and focusing on results-driven leadership to address the pressing issues facing Southwest Austin families, including rising costs, underfunded schools, and economic opportunities.

 "I'm running for the Texas House because our community deserves a representative who rolls up their sleeves and gets to work—not engage in performative politics or culture wars," said Kopser. "After 20 years in the Army and years building Austin's innovation economy, I know progress happens when leaders listen first, lead always, and bring people together to solve problems. Texans are tired of the same old politics; it's time to fight back smarter, build stronger, and get things done for working families." Kopser's campaign draws on his extensive experience in service, innovation, and community building. A West Point graduate with a degree in Aerospace Engineering and a master's from the Harvard Kennedy School, he served 20 years in the U.S. Army, earning the Ranger Tab, Combat Action Badge, and Bronze Star. He taught Leadership and Strategy at UT Austin and West Point, and today serves as a special advisor for military and veteran affairs at the University of Texas. As co-founder of RideScout—acquired by Mercedes-Benz in 2014—and President of Grayline Group, Kopser has created jobs, mentored entrepreneurs, and strengthened Texas's tech and energy sectors. He was recognized as a White House Champion of Change and, in 2025, named a Future Texas Business Legend by the Texas Business Hall of Fame.

 In his 2018 run for Congress, Kopser built a bipartisan coalition that won the Democratic primary with a message of working across the aisle to focus on jobs, education, and our kids' future. In under 18 months, his campaign pioneered innovative fundraising and voter communication techniques, raising over $3.1 million—the highest amount by any candidate, Republican or Democrat, incumbent or challenger, across Texas's 36 congressional districts in Q4 2017. Emphasizing bipartisanship and problem-solving, Kopser received more votes than any Democrat in Texas congressional history up to that point and drove record turnout, with more voters participating in his district than any other in the state—falling short by fewer than three points in a heavily gerrymandered race. Kopser's platform prioritizes a strong economy for all, education for every child, and securing our kids' future. He pledges to fight for fully funded classrooms, competitive teacher pay, and education-to-career pipelines; support small businesses and high-wage careers in tech, energy, cybersecurity, and trades; and address infrastructure, public safety, and affordability to make Texas a place where every family can thrive.

 In his launch he states: I’m Joseph Kopser, a West Point grad and Army vet and I can’t sit on the sidelines.

 That’s what drove me to file as a Democrat for State Representative to represent South and West Austin.

 MAGA Republicans control all branches of government in DC and in Texas. In Texas.

 It’s time for Democrats to fight back smarter, build stronger, and get things done for Texas families. We can’t keep running the same old playbook.

 So I came up with 4 rules to change the game and be part of the solution:

 1. Stand up for healthcare

 From Medicaid cuts to the end of Obamacare subsidies.we’re all in the same boat now.

 1. Take on rising costs

 Speaking out against tariffs and helping young families access capital to put homeownership within their reach.

 1. Broaden our coalition

 We can’t just preach to the choir. We’re either growing or we’re dying..

 1. Be wary of distractions

 No matter the outrage of the day, we have to stay focused on kitchen table issues while defending the dignity every Texan deserves.

 It’s time for leaders who bring new energy, different experiences, and are focused on results.

 Kopser's personal story underscores his motivation. A photo of his family at Fort Hood in 1999, contrasted with one from last year in Austin, captures his journey with wife Amy and their three daughters. "Like every family, I want Texans to feel proud raising their children here. That's what drives me," he added.
