# TCU Professor Talks Fort Worth Growth, Governance on Building Texas Show

Fort Worth, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Feb 16, 2026 @ 10:40 AM US/Central — Dr. Brandon Chicotsky, associate professor at Texas Christian University (TCU), private equity advisor, and founder of God Bless Retirement, joined Justin Mckenzie on The Building Texas Show to analyze Fort Worth’s record-breaking growth, strategic economic policies, and the role of academia in shaping a prosperous future for North Texas.

 A City on the Rise: $6.7B in Capital InvestmentFort Worth saw $6.7 billion in new capital investment in fiscal year 2025—its strongest year in over a decade. Chicotsky attributed this momentum to projects in aerospace, tech, logistics, and advanced manufacturing, with companies actively recruiting from TCU’s top-ranked programs like the TCU Sales Center, where graduates often earn over $100,000 in their first year.

 “Our story is one of faith, grit & opportunity. From TCU’s classrooms to the Stockyards, Fort Worth blends heritage with innovation that’s uniquely Texan & undeniably successful.” – Dr. Brandon Chicotsky

 Functional Government & “Sensible” GrowthChicotsky emphasized that Fort Worth’s success stems from “sensible government” focused on outcomes rather than political performance.

 “We haven’t lost decorum entirely,” he said. “We operationalize government—like mixed-use urban infill in Westside Village—while other major cities get stuck in virtue signaling.”

 He highlighted collaborations with developers like John Goff and Ross Perot Jr., and academic expansions such as UTA West and Texas A&M’s new downtown law school as proof of the city’s investable climate.

 Incentives That Work: Chapter 312 & 380 AgreementsThe professor outlined Fort Worth’s structured approach to incentives, using Chapter 312 tax abatements and Chapter 380 “pay-as-you-go” agreements to attract projects that expand the tax base without patching budget shortfalls—a contrast to what he called “stuck cities” like Chicago or San Francisco.

 “We use incentives to grow, not to fill gaps,” Chicotsky explained. “With 66,000 undeveloped acres, we’re positioned for quality growth that outpaces infrastructure costs.”

 Storytelling & Fort Worth’s “Western Chic” BrandChicotsky connected economic strategy with cultural identity, noting Fort Worth’s unique blend of history and modernity—from its origins as a frontier fort to today’s “Western chic” culture, thriving stockyards, and Paramount-backed production campus led by Taylor Sheridan.

 “Tourism isn’t fluff,” he said. “We had 11.5 million visitors in 2024, generating over $3.5 billion in economic impact. Our story is one of faith, family, and first principles—and it’s attracting the world.”
