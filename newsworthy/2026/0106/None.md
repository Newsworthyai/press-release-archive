# Lifespring Chiropractic Welcomes Dr. Sean Ly as Demand Surges for Austin’s Nervous-System–Focused Care

Austin, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Jan 6, 2026 @ 7:00 AM Central — Lifespring Chiropractic, recently voted Best Chiropractor in Austin for the fourth time by Austin Fit Magazine, announces the addition of Dr. Sean Ly to its growing team. Dr. Sean joined the practice in November 2025, marking both a strategic expansion and a response to overwhelming community demand for chiropractic care that goes far beyond temporary relief.

 As Lifespring completes its transition into a fully neurologic, non-traditional, non-cracking model of care, patient referrals have surged. Austin families are reporting lasting improvements—better sleep, anxiety relief, improved digestion and energy, stronger immune function in children, and performance breakthroughs once thought unreachable.

 Why Are More Austinites Searching for Chiropractic That Goes Beyond 2-Day Pain Relief? Unlike traditional chiropractic models focused on joints or isolated areas of discomfort, Lifespring centers its entire approach on the nervous system—the system behind the symptoms.

 Through INSIGHT scans, Lifespring measures stress patterns in the nervous system that influence digestion, sleep, mood, immunity, mobility, and overall energy. By addressing the system that controls all others, patients often experience multi-dimensional improvements.

 One Austin patient in his mid-30s, who had spent over seven hours a week stretching and doing mobility exercises just to function, found dramatic improvement once his nervous system was addressed. With greater system-wide coherence, he now spends his reclaimed hours on family, friendships, and activities he loves.

 What’s Driving Lifespring’s Rapid Growth in Austin? Over the past several months, as Lifespring shifted fully from a hybrid structural based model into a pure nervous-system–based practice, patient results accelerated. Families continue to refer their friends, coworkers, and neighbors.

 “We’re seeing transformations we simply couldn’t achieve with traditional methods,” said founder Dr. Matt Delgado. “What makes Lifespring special is the team behind it. Dr. Sean brings a depth of integrity and curiosity that matches the heart of our mission.”

 Why Did Dr. Sean Leave Traditional Chiropractic to Join Lifespring? After working in a corporate chiropractic chain focused on volume, Dr. Sean felt called to practice with more intention, depth, and coherence. Lifespring’s tonal and neurologic model offered that opportunity.

 “Coming from a high-volume chiropractic environment, I was shocked by what I experienced here at Lifespring. The nervous system responds to the smallest, most precise gentle input in ways I had never seen before. The level of coherence within our team and our systems allows patients to explore new layers of their health with clarity and confidence. I wish more of my former colleagues knew that chiropractic has so much more depth than what many of us were taught—stepping into that depth requires growth, curiosity, and a willingness to expand beyond what feels familiar” said Dr. Sean Ly.

 How Is Lifespring Preparing for Sustainable, Long-Term Growth? As demand rises, Lifespring is deliberately expanding its clinical team. The practice prioritizes values-driven hiring to maintain quality, culture, and long-term community impact.

 “We’re not growing for the sake of growing,” said Dr. Delgado. “We want chiropractors who hold true to our values—doctors who won’t compromise on quality and who want to build something sustainable that serves Austin for decades.”
