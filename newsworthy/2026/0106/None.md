# Vote Like A Texan Features Congressional District 31 Candidate Abhiram Garapati

Congressional District 31, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Jan 6, 2026 @ 10:15 AM Central — Vote Like A Texan, the civic interview series hosted by Justin McKenzie, continues its mission to increase voter awareness with an in-depth conversation featuring Abhiram Garapati, a candidate for Texas Congressional District 31.

 In the episode, Garapati shares his personal journey from immigrating to the United States legally to building successful businesses and agricultural operations across Central Texas. The discussion explores his motivations for seeking public office, his views on fiscal responsibility, immigration policy, rural infrastructure, workforce development, and the future of education and technology in Texas.

 Garapati describes arriving in the United States with limited resources and navigating the legal immigration process over 15 years before becoming a U.S. citizen. He credits the opportunity-driven nature of the country for his success and says that experience shaped his desire to serve in Congress without accepting a salary or campaign donations.

 The conversation also addresses border security and immigration reform, with Garapati emphasizing respect for the rule of law while advocating for a more efficient and accessible legal immigration system. As a farmer and rancher raising cattle in Central Texas, he highlights the importance of agriculture, rural communities, and the challenges facing volunteer fire departments in fast-growing Hill Country counties.

 Education and workforce readiness emerge as central themes, particularly the need for stronger STEM education and preparation for artificial intelligence and emerging technologies. Garapati argues that Texas’ economic future depends on equipping students and workers for rapid technological change across industries—from engineering and space to agriculture and manufacturing.

 McKenzie and Garapati also discuss the role of a member of Congress as a bridge between federal resources and local needs, including public safety, infrastructure, and economic development. The episode reinforces the importance of civic participation, especially during primary elections, where voter turnout historically remains low.

 This interview is part of Vote Like A Texan’s broader effort to provide Texans with direct access to candidates, allowing voters to hear perspectives in long-form, substantive conversations ahead of early voting and primary election dates.
