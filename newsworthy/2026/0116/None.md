# Rock Solid Podcast Goes Live at Round Rock Chamber’s 2026 State of the Chamber

Round Rock, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Jan 16, 2026 @ 7:00 AM Central — The Round Rock Chamber of Commerce kicked off 2026 with a standing-room-only State of the Chamber Power Lunch at Embassy Suites Round Rock, welcoming more than 230 attendees from across Central Texas.

 A centerpiece of the event was a live, on-stage recording of the Rock Solid Round Rock podcast, hosted by Bryan Eisenberg, co-owner of A Place At Home – North Austin. The format brought an authentic, conversational lens to the Chamber’s annual update, inviting the audience into a deeper discussion about where the organization — and the city — is headed.

 How Did Chamber Leaders Reflect on 2025 Successes? Outgoing Board Chair Selicia Sanchez-Adame shared reflections on a milestone year that included the Chamber’s 75th anniversary and progress toward its ambitious drive to reach 1,000 members.

 She highlighted the continued strength of the Chamber’s Ambassador program and referral network, emphasizing how relationship-building remains central to business growth in Round Rock.

 What Economic Development Priorities Were Discussed? Chamber leadership outlined a forward-looking approach to economic development, workforce readiness, and education — grounded in collaboration.

 Key discussion points included:

 * A unique partnership between the City of Round Rock and the Chamber
* A five-year strategic plan focused on economic development and innovation
* Continued support for entrepreneurship, including the gBeta accelerator and a preview of a forthcoming pre-accelerator program
* Advancing awareness of local education assets, from four-year degree pathways at ACC to expanded opportunities at Texas State University beyond healthcare

 The conversation reinforced Round Rock’s position as a city investing intentionally in talent, innovation, and long-term growth.

 How Is the Chamber Advocating for Business at the State Level? Jordan Robinson, President & CEO of the Chamber, addressed the business climate and advocacy efforts during the 89th Legislative Session. She shared insights from testifying at the Texas Capitol on key issues such as sales tax policy and maintaining strong relationships with state and federal officials.

 Attendees also heard about the Chamber’s Post-Legislative event, which brought high-caliber speakers from across the state to help local businesses understand the broader policy landscape.

 What Investments Are Shaping the Chamber’s Future? A major announcement highlighted during the live recording was the launch of the Round Rock Chamber Foundation and the success of its Founders Wall Campaign, which raised $400,000.

 The Foundation is designed to support business-to-business initiatives without competing with existing nonprofits, with early focus areas including:

 * Leadership development programs
* The Young Professionals initiative
* Leadership Round Rock and Ascend

 The Chamber also shared updates on returning to the historic Griffith Building in downtown Round Rock, reinforcing its long-term commitment to the city’s core.

 What Vision Was Shared for the Year Ahead? Incoming Board Chair Deana Cavanaugh closed the discussion by outlining priorities for the future, centered on member retention, deeper engagement, and continued investment in the Chamber Foundation.

 Her remarks emphasized building on the momentum of recent years while ensuring the Chamber remains responsive, inclusive, and closely connected to the businesses it serves.

 “I’m incredibly proud of the work our Chamber, board, volunteers and partners accomplished over the past year,” said Jordan Robinson, President & CEO of the Round Rock Chamber. “The State of the Chamber gives us the opportunity to not only reflect on that progress, but to clearly share where we’re headed next — and how we will continue to strengthen our business community while creating new opportunities for Round Rock’s future.”

 “Having this conversation live, in front of the people we serve, reflects the Chamber’s commitment to transparency and connection,” said Bryan Eisenberg. “This is how strong communities move forward together.”

 The Impact Extends Beyond Round Rock By pairing its annual State of the Chamber with a live Rock Solid Round Rock podcast recording, the Round Rock Chamber created a shared experience that blended reflection, accountability, and vision. For attendees, it offered not just an update, but a clearer understanding of how leadership decisions today will shape Round Rock’s economic and civic future and inspire the leaders of tomorrow.
