# Kopser Reports $50,000+ Raised in First 3 Weeks of HD47 Race

Austin, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Friday Jan 16, 2026 @ 4:15 PM Central — Austin, TX — Just over three weeks after officially entering the race for Texas House District 47, Joseph Kopser’s campaign reports strong early fundraising momentum, signaling broad support and readiness to engage voters ahead of the March Democratic primary.

 Campaign finance filings on 15 January show that in the three week period following his entry into the race on Dec 9th, Kopser raised more than $53,000—including during a holiday stretch when fundraising activity typically slows. The early support reflects contributions from a wide network of donors spanning clean energy, transportation, education, urban planning, technology, and longtime supporters from Kopser’s previous civic and entrepreneurial work.

 Kopser said his campaign is focused on four priorities: standing up for healthcare, taking on rising costs, broadening the coalition, and being wary of distractions so the campaign remains focused on the issues that matter most to Texas families.

 “Despite only officially starting our campaign on December 9, we outraised our Democratic opponent by 35% over the same period of time,” Kopser said. “If we’re going to fight back—and fight smarter—we have to be serious about communicating and engaging with voters.”

 House District 47 is an open seat, with early voting beginning February 17 and Election Day on March 3. With no runoff expected, the winner of the Democratic primary will likely be the next State Representative for the district in this heavily gerrymandered district.
