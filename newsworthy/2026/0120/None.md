# The Midwife in Vienna Reinforces Its Midwife-Led Approach to Natural Mother and Baby Care

Boca Raton, Florida (Newsworthy.ai) Tuesday Jan 20, 2026 @ 9:15 AM Pacific — As American parents increasingly seek trustworthy alternatives in maternal and baby wellness, The Midwife in Vienna, founded by Austrian midwife Sarah Lares, is reinforcing the philosophy that defines the brand: care guided by real-world experience, education, and simplicity.

 Unlike many wellness brands driven by trends or aggressive marketing, The Midwife in Vienna was born from nearly two decades of hands-on midwifery practice. Each product reflects Lares’ belief that mothers and babies benefit most from formulations rooted in knowledge, restraint, and respect for the body’s natural processes.

 “As a midwife, my role has always been to educate, reassure, and support — not to overwhelm,” said Sarah Lares, founder of The Midwife in Vienna. “That same mindset shapes everything we create. Parents don’t need more products; they need better ones they can truly trust.”

 From Midwifery Practice to Purpose-Driven Products Lares began developing her formulations while supporting women through pregnancy, birth, and postpartum recovery in Vienna. The remedies she relied on most were gentle, time-tested, and free from unnecessary ingredients.

 That philosophy evolved into a curated line of organic, minimalist products for mothers and babies — all crafted in Austria using certified organic, food-grade ingredients. Each formulation is intentionally simple, designed to support rather than interfere with the body’s natural rhythms.

 Meeting a New Generation of Informed Parents Today’s parents are more educated and discerning than ever. They ask where products are made, what ingredients are used, and whether claims are rooted in experience rather than marketing language. The Midwife in Vienna answers those questions through transparency, traceability, and consistency.

 By prioritizing education alongside product development, the brand helps parents feel confident in their choices — an increasingly important factor in the crowded wellness marketplace.

 The brand’s growing U.S. presence reflects this trust-based approach. Its products are currently available through OneLavi.com, with additional availability on Amazon.com coming soon, as the company continues expanding thoughtfully across the U.S. market.

 A Foundation Built for Long-Term Growth As The Midwife in Vienna continues expanding its presence in the United States, the company remains focused on sustainable growth grounded in trust and authenticity. Rather than rushing to scale, the brand emphasizes alignment — partnering with retailers and platforms that value quality, education, and long-term relationships with consumers.

 Our growth is guided by the same principle as our care,” Lares said. “Slow, thoughtful, and always centered on what’s best for families.
