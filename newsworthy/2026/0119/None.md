# Building Texas Show Explores Growth, Public Safety, and the Future of Lakeway with Mayor Tom Kilgore

Lakeway, Texas (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Jan 19, 2026 @ 3:50 PM US/Central — As Texas communities face rapid growth, infrastructure pressure, and increasing public safety demands, The Building Texas Show turns its focus to Lakeway, a Hill Country city navigating change while doubling down on community values and civic pride.

 In a newly released episode, host Justin McKenzie sits down with Tom Kilgore for an in-depth conversation on leadership, long-term planning, emergency preparedness, and the behind-the-scenes work that keeps a growing Texas city strong.

 The episode explores how Lakeway has nearly doubled in population over the past decade and how city leadership is balancing private property rights, infrastructure investment, economic development, and quality of life—while preserving the community’s small-town character.

 You can’t turn up the tap and pull up the drawbridge in Texas,” Mayor Kilgore says. “Growth brings opportunity, but it also requires discipline, planning, and cooperation.

 A City Defined by Service and Volunteerism A central highlight of the episode is Lakeway’s long-standing role as host city for the Special Olympics of Texas Winter Games and Leadership Conference—an event Lakeway has proudly hosted for five consecutive years in partnership with neighboring communities, including Bee Cave.

 Each year, the event brings more than 1,200 athletes, thousands of family members, coaches, and supporters to the area—filling hotel rooms, restaurants, and local businesses while showcasing the region’s hospitality and heart.

 “We get far more out of hosting the Special Olympics than the event itself,” Kilgore notes. “We get to cheer on incredible athletes, welcome families from across Texas, and see our community at its very best.”

 The episode emphasizes Lakeway’s deep volunteer culture, which consistently supplies hundreds of volunteers to support the Games—an effort city leaders say reflects the broader spirit of service that defines the community.

 Planning for Growth, Safety, and the Future Beyond tourism and events, the conversation dives into Lakeway’s proactive approach to wildfire mitigation, emergency response coordination, and long-term comprehensive planning—much of which happens years before residents ever see a council vote.

 Mayor Kilgore also discusses the realities of volunteer city leadership in Texas, regional collaboration with surrounding cities, and why civic engagement is critical as Lakeway prepares for the future.

 Looking ahead to 2026 and the nation’s 250th anniversary, the episode underscores how Lakeway’s community traditions—from its iconic Fourth of July parade to city-wide volunteerism—continue to anchor the city even as it evolves.
