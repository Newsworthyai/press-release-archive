# SalesNexus Launches Revenue Enablement &amp; RevOps Webinar Series to Help B2B Sales Leaders Close Revenue Gaps

Houston, TX (Newsworthy.ai) Monday Jan 19, 2026 @ 9:00 AM Central — SalesNexus, a leading provider of AI-powered CRM and marketing automation for B2B sales teams, today announced the launch of its Revenue Enablement & RevOps Webinar Series, a live, expert-led program designed to help sales leaders identify and fix the most common causes of stalled deals, missed forecasts, and revenue leakage.

 The series is built for CROs, VPs of Sales, RevOps leaders, and Sales Enablement teams at B2B organizations with complex, multi-stakeholder sales cycles. Each session focuses on the real operational breakdowns that occur between sales process, enablement, content, coaching, and CRM execution—and provides a practical framework for closing those gaps.

 “Most revenue problems aren’t caused by a lack of effort or tools—they’re caused by misalignment,” said Craig Klein, CEO at SalesNexus. “This webinar series shows leaders exactly where revenue leaks happen, why more tools don’t fix readiness, and how to operationalize enablement inside the sales workflow—using data and AI to drive consistent execution.”

 What Attendees Will Learn Across the series, attendees will gain:

 * A diagnostic framework for identifying revenue leakage
* Insight into where enablement breaks down between strategy and execution
* Why coaching, content, and CRM adoption often fail to reinforce each other
* How AI can enforce focus, improve rep behavior, and surface deal-risk signals earlier
* Practical steps to align RevOps, Sales Enablement, and frontline sales teams

 Each webinar will be presented by Marc McNamara, Founder of The Enablement Group and leading expert in B2B Revenue Enablement, as well as Craig Klein, SalesNexus CEO. Webinars will include real-world examples, actionable takeaways, and live Q&A with revenue operations and sales enablement experts.

 Designed for Modern B2B Revenue Teams The Revenue Enablement & RevOps Webinar Series is ideal for organizations selling high-value products or services, managing long sales cycles, and navigating increasing pressure to forecast accurately while improving rep productivity.

 Registration is free, and sessions are available live and on-demand. The webinar series begins January 28th, 2026 with additional webinars every three weeks throughout 2026.
