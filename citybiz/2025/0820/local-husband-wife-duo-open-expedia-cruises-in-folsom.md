# Local Husband-Wife Duo Open Expedia Cruises in Folsom

Planning a vacation has just become a lot easier for community members in Folsom with the opening of a new Expedia Cruises location at 705 E Bidwell St, Suite 12.

 As a full-service leisure travel agency franchise backed by one of the most powerful travel brands in the world, Folsom community members now have a go-to resource for all their travel needs.

 The Folsom location is owned and operated by local husband-wife duo, Lisa and Shawn Yahrling, who have a team of Vacation Consultants on site working to book travelers’ perfect vacations.

 The Yahrlings bring extensive experience in the hospitality industry. Lisa built her career in marketing with Caesars Entertainment, while Shawn worked in the table games department. After the birth of their daughter, Shawn took on the role of stay-at-home dad, a job he considers his most rewarding.

 The Yahrlings are no strangers to travel. They met in Memphis and have lived in Florida, Las Vegas, Iowa, New Jersey, and California, which they consider their favorite place to call home. They have enjoyed vacations to many locations including Alaska, Canada, the Caribbean, US National Parks, Costa Rica, England, many countries in Europe as well as an amazing multi-generational Mediterranean cruise. With their extensive travel background and the absence of an Expedia Cruises in the area, opening their own location felt like the perfect opportunity to fill a need in the community.

 “There are so many ways to book a vacation these days, but it can be overwhelming to sort through all the options and feel confident you are getting the best deal,” said Lisa. “Having an Expedia Cruises brick-and-mortar location gives travelers the reassurance of expert guidance, personalized recommendations, and access to exclusive deals they might not find online. Travel is such an incredible experience, and we are excited to help people plan their dream vacations with confidence and make a positive impact in their lives through travel.”

 Expedia Cruises – part of the Expedia Group family of brands – offers air, land, and sea vacations through its 260+ locations across North America. Customers can choose from numerous vacation possibilities including luxury and expedition travel, river cruises, land tours, safaris, all-inclusive resort properties, and insurance – all at Expedia prices. In addition to the research and booking features available on their local website, the Yahrlings and their team offer personal vacation consultations in-person, through email, or over the phone, so customers always have the freedom to book when, where, and how they choose!

 Expedia Cruises Vacation Consultants are provided with extensive training and marketing support which allows them to become navigators of spectacular vacation experiences.
