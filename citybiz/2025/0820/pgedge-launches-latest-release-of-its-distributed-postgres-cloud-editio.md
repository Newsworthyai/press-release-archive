# pgEdge Launches Latest Release of Its Distributed Postgres Cloud Editio

pgEdge, Inc., the leading company dedicated to distributed Postgres, today announced the latest release of pgEdge Cloud. pgEdge Cloud Edition is the first fully distributed Database as a Service (DBaaS) built entirely on the widely adopted open source PostgreSQL database. Optimized for applications requiring deployment across multiple cloud regions, pgEdge Cloud enables businesses to achieve high availability, lower latency, and meet data residency requirements.

 As part of this release, pgEdge Cloud adds multi-availability zone support and builds upon the latest release of pgEdge Platform v25. These enhancements make pgEdge Cloud even more robust for mission-critical, geo-distributed applications that demand always-on availability and seamless conflict handling. pgEdge Cloud also inherits major improvements from the pgEdge Platform v25 release which includes a significant upgrade to the Spock extension, pgEdge’s advanced logical replication engine.

 Key feature enhancements to pgEdge Cloud include:

 * Multi-Availability Zone support: Customers can now deploy multiple nodes in the same region across different availability zones, enabling greater fault tolerance and compliance with high-availability best practices. This enhancement allows for more flexible and resilient cluster topologies, with the option to place multiple nodes in the same or different AZs within a region.

 * Expanded Automatic Conflict Resolution: This release introduces smarter conflict handling for distributed environments, reducing the need for application level exception handling code. Scenarios like duplicate inserts and missing delete targets are now resolved automatically, and support has been added for handling unique constraint violations using configurable Last-Write-Wins logic. These improvements simplify application development in multi-node deployments.

 * Improved Performance: pgEdge Cloud delivers significant performance gains, particularly in replication operations. Exception handling is now performed in-memory, reducing latency and speeding up conflict resolution. Lag tracking has been redesigned to operate at the target node, improving measurement accuracy and avoiding misleading lag reports during idle periods. These upgrades result in faster, more reliable replication behavior across distributed clusters.

 “We are very pleased to announce that the latest release of pgEdge Cloud is available and, as before, built on standard open source PostgreSQL,” said Phillip Merrick, Co-founder and CEO of pgEdge. “These key enhancements continue to support our mission to make it easy for developers to build, deploy, and run enterprise-class distributed Postgres applications across the global network.”

 pgEdge has also successfully completed a System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 Type II audit, performed by Sensiba LLP (Sensiba). Developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), the SOC 2 information security audit provides a report on the examination of controls relevant to the trust services criteria categories covering security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. A SOC 2 Type II report describes a service organization’s systems, whether the design of specified controls meets the relevant trust services categories, and assesses the effectiveness of those controls over a specified period of time.pgEdge’s SOC 2 Type II report did not have any noted exceptions and was therefore issued with a “clean” audit opinion from Sensiba.
