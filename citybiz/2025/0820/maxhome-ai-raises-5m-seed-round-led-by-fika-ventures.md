# MaxHome.AI Raises $5M Seed Round led by Fika Ventures

MaxHome.AI, the AI-native operating system designed to streamline and automate residential real estate transactions, today announced a $5 million seed funding round led by Fika Ventures, with participation from BBG Ventures, 1Sharpe Ventures and Four Acres Capital. This round brings the company’s total funding to $7 million, including its previously announced $2 million pre-seed round.

 MaxHome.AI was founded to fix the chaos that begins the moment a buyer is ready to make an offer—chasing documents, tracking signatures, ensuring compliance, and coordinating across agents, lenders, and title companies. Its AI-powered platform automates document processing and back-office workflows for brokerages, reducing manual effort and errors, and enabling a faster, smoother homebuying experience for everyone involved

 “MaxHome.AI is redefining how the real estate industry operates,” said Divya Aathresh, CEO and Founder of MaxHome.AI. “By building an AI-native system tailored to the complexities of real estate, we’re not just improving efficiency, we’re creating the infrastructure that modern brokerages will rely on to compete and thrive in a rapidly evolving market. This is no longer about incremental change, it’s about establishing a new standard for how real estate gets done.”

 Brokerages across the country are under increased operational and economic pressure, particularly in the wake of shifts in buyer agent commission structures. MaxHome.AI addresses this challenge head-on by automating the manual, repetitive tasks that drain brokerage resources, from compliance and data entry to transaction coordination. Early customer adoption underscores the platform’s value: MaxHome.AI is currently working with leading independent brokerages as well as franchise affiliates of Berkshire Hathaway and Coldwell Banker.

 “We believe MaxHome.AI is building foundational infrastructure for modern brokerages,” said John Chen, General Partner at Fika Ventures. “Deep domain expertise and founder-market fit are critical for us when backing a company — and in MaxHome.AI’s case, both were undeniable. That edge has enabled them to build AI copilots that are deeply embedded, incredibly useful, and already delivering real ROI.”

 MaxHome.AI’s founder, Divya Aathresh, previously led real estate partnerships and in-house brokerage operations at Better.com, where she scaled the agent network to more than 15,000 agents. Her firsthand experience with the inefficiencies in traditional workflows, and her vision for AI-powered automation, have shaped MaxHome.AI into a category-defining product.

 “MaxHome has eliminated the friction in our transaction process that we didn’t even realize was solvable,” said Wendi Iglesias, Chief Information Officer at The Keyes Company. “The impact on our operations has been immediate and meaningful.”

 As the platform expands and new products come online, including solutions that reimagine core transaction touchpoints—MaxHome.AI continues to build momentum with leading brokerages and forward-thinking real estate professionals.

 With this new funding, the company is poised to deepen its technology capabilities and accelerate its product roadmap in response to growing market demand.
