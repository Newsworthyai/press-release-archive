# Unlocking Potential: New D1 Training Facility in Madison to Shape Future Athletes

D1 Training, a leading fitness enrichment concept utilizing the five core tenets of athletic-based training, recently opened a new location in Madison at 7830 Highway 72 West, Suite 130. The new group fitness facility employs a sports-science backed training regimen led by certified trainers to help people of all ages achieve their sport and fitness goals.

 Brandon and Lisa Badgley will join a roster of impressive existing franchisees, including professional athletes like Kylie Fitts and Jordan Gay. Additional D1 partners include NBA star Chris Paul and Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow.

 Brandon has enjoyed a 20+ year career in Aerospace Engineering and Program Management. Additionally, he has been coaching women’s lacrosse for over 15 years. He currently serves as an assistant women’s lacrosse coach at the University of Alabama Huntsville and is a former NCAA D1 head coach. Lisa is a teacher with a deep passion for working with kids and relationship development. The Badgley’s have three children who are active in sports. The new D1 Training location gives their kids something to be excited about while also teaching them valuable lessons about business and entrepreneurship.

 For the Badgleys, this venture is about more than just fitness. It is about community development and making a positive impact in their town. One of the main things that drew them to D1 Training was the opportunity to help young people build confidence through fitness. They want to show kids that no matter what their goal is, athletic training will build a foundation of confidence, perseverance, resilience, and determination. D1 Training provides an accessible option for kids to stay active, develop strength, and build healthy habits in a supportive environment.

 “For me, D1 Training is an opportunity to help kids reach the next level, whether that means competing in college athletics or simply being the best version of themselves,” said Brandon. “What I love about D1

 Training is that it also brings families together, allowing them to work out and achieve their goals as a team.”

 D1 Training offers four age-based programs including Rookie (ages 7-11), Developmental (ages 12-14), Prep (ages 15-18) and D1 Adult. Each fitness program is based on the five athletic-based tenets: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down. Outside of group workouts, D1 Training offers group, semi-private, and one-on-one training with world-class coaches. The goal is simple: to continue to train athletes who are dedicated to their sport or fitness goals, regardless of age, or athletic background.

 Strategically expanding across the nation through franchising, D1 Training has more than 100 performance centers open with over 100 additional locations in various stages of development. The brand is currently seeking financially qualified business builders, former athletes, and entrepreneurs, who share a passion for fitness and youth sports, who are ready to make a positive impact on their community.
