# Datavault AI Reports $1.7M in Q2 2025 Revenue, Achieving 467% Year-Over-Year Growth and Secures $2.5M Licensing Agreement with Nyiax

* Establishing Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) from Patented AI Agentic Platforms and Technology Licensing, Along with Pending Closure of API Media Acquisition, Set to Contribute to Record-Breaking Revenue Generation and Market Momentum in 2025
* Management targeting annual cost-efficiency measures, yielding total savings exceeding $4 million by 2026 while optimizing for continued growth

 Datavault AI Inc. (Nasdaq: DVLT), a leader in AI-powered data monetization and exchange solutions, today reported strong financial performance for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025. Recognized revenue rose to $1.7 million, up significantly from $0.3 million in Q2 2024—a 467% year-over-year increase—while also achieving 176% sequential quarterly growth. This robust expansion underscores the company’s accelerating momentum in intellectual property commercialization and strategic partnerships as it unifies CompuSystems, API Media, ADIO, and Datavault technologies and their respective businesses under one operation.

 Furthermore, Datavault AI secured $2.5 million in patent licensing bookings not included in Q2 results, stemming from its cross-licensing agreement with Nyiax Inc. This agreement provides critical access to the NASDAQ financial framework, fostering the launch of three token exchanges, which are expected to be recognized in future periods and further bolster revenue visibility. The license will be paid in Nyiax stock to strengthen the partnership between the companies. These strategic achievements in the second quarter of 2025 underscore the operational and financial momentum under the new leadership team.

 Since January 7, 2025, Datavault AI has executed on the integration of Datavault Holdings, WiSA, CSI, and partnerships with IBM Watsonx, Nyiax, GFT Rewards, and Turner Global Media. These initiatives are driving revenue acceleration toward a $25 million run rate by year-end and positioning the company for a $40–$50 million revenue target in 2026.

 Seminal Event in the United States Regulatory Environment and the Role of Intellectual Property Expansion at Datavault AI

 On July 21, the company announced Genius Act Signed into Law Validating Growing Datavault AI Patent Portfolio.

 Top U.S. Banks have been identified as patent infringers by third-party legal counsel involving the Datavault AI patented exchange and Web 3.0 technologies, which are designed to monetize data, real-world assets, and precious earth elements. An extensive financial and technological expert review has been conducted, along with detailed claim charts. The company has retained top-tier IP litigation funding and counsel, Fish Richardson LLP, to pursue licensing settlements or initiate litigation-based licensing activities immediately.

 Key holdings and claims include secure data monetization, AI-driven valuation, and acoustic innovations for defense and consumer applications, fostering trust through Web 3.0 anchoring, scalability, and cyber-secure compliance in high-stakes sectors like defense, biotech, and finance.

 This aligns with Datavault AI’s strategic plan, as evidenced by press releases announcing partnerships (e.g., with Burke Products for defense applications on July 22, 2025; IBM Partner Plus integration on March 2025; and FEC approval for political campaigns on December 21, 2022), market expansions (e.g., Elements Exchange for tokenized real-world assets on July 17, 2025), and revenue projections (e.g., $50M target by 2026 via tokenized RWAs).

 Datavault AI’s expanding intellectual property (IP) portfolio now includes 72 patent assets (30 issued, 10 allowed, 32+ pending), 14 issued trademarks, 11 allowed trademarks, and 3 pending trademarks.
