# Q&amp;A with Evan Tilley, Vice President of Operations, Texas at Universal Parking: The Future of Parking in Dallas–Fort Worth

The Dallas–Fort Worth (DFW) metroplex is booming. In 2024, the region was the third-fastest-growing metro area in the U.S. behind only New York and Houston, with a total population nearing 8.3 million residents. As DFW grows, so does the demand for housing, retail and office space, which all leads to an increased demand for parking.

 Evan Tilley is Vice President of Operations, Texas at Universal Parking. He has more than 20 years of parking and hospitality experience and oversees Universal’s self-parking operations for the Texas market. We caught up with Evan to discuss the growth of Dallas-Fort Worth and how parking is evolving to keep up with a population surge.

 DFW just saw massive population growth—the third-largest in the nation. How is the region managing this expansion? What are the implications for parking?

 Earlier this year, the Dallas City Council passed the Dallas Parking Reform bill, which eliminates nearly all the city’s one-size-fits-all parking minimums. The bill allows for more flexibility in parking design and encourages developers to consider the specific needs of their projects and the surrounding community when it comes to parking. This supports the higher-density, mixed-use developments needed to accommodate population growth in walkable urban areas. It also reduces parking minimums, allowing developers to use land more efficiently, particularly in downtown areas. This means more housing or commercial units rather than empty parking spots.

 In other areas, however, the response has been to add parking. In Frisco, for instance, a $26 million parking garage is under construction in the downtown Rail District to support ongoing revitalization in the area. These types of projects are designed not just to provide more parking spaces but to support development in these rapidly growing suburban cores.

 What trends are shaping how people park in the region?

 On the policy side, we discussed how relaxed minimums are impacting how people park. Another shift we’re seeing is a rise in technology. DFW and the surrounding areas are rapidly adopting mobile apps and smart parking technologies to improve convenience and streamline operations. Fort Worth’s FW PARK app allows drivers to find and pay for parking, receive alerts and even reserve spots in advance.

 At the DFW Airport, AI-based license plate recognition (LPR) systems streamline entry and exit, while digital reservations and dynamic pricing models offer greater flexibility for travelers. The airport is also part of a pilot program for autonomous valet parking, aimed at improving curbside flow and optimizing drop-off zones. These advances signal a broader trend toward automation and data-driven decision-making in regional parking infrastructure, especially in high-volume, high-demand locations.

 What are the challenges in driving more widespread adoption of this technology?

 Smart parking solutions and app-based payment systems are certainly helping to make parking more efficient. However, it’s important to consider all drivers when considering parking solutions. There are still some drivers who don’t use smartphones, and some parkers need to pay in cash. Additionally, some companies may not be able to afford the necessary infrastructure to support smart parking technology fully.

 Other issues with parking apps include human error, such as entering the wrong license plate or zone number, which can result in unnecessary fines. There can be connection problems in areas with poor cell service. That said, parking apps tend to be most effective in urban areas, like DFW, because the digital infrastructure is more robust.

 What does the future of parking look like in DFW?

 Automation and the use of technology will only continue to grow, but that doesn’t mean it is the only answer. In a hybrid system, smart apps offer real-time availability and contactless payment options to parkers, while also providing key data insights on usage patterns, peak parking times, and durations to businesses and lot owners.

 In addition to the chosen technology, whether that is an app or an LPR, having staff on site can enhance the parking experience. Staff can offer personal assistance to parkers and provide a sense of security. This combination enables businesses to optimize parking turnover, implement dynamic pricing and create a safer and more reliable parking environment.

 Growth of DFW isn’t slowing down, so it’s time to rethink how we handle the parking needed to accommodate that growth.
