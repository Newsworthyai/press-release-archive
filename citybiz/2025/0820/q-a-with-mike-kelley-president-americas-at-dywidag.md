# Q&amp;A with Mike Kelley, President, Americas at DYWIDAG

Mike Kelley is the President for the Americas Region at DYWIDAG, bringing over 40 years of experience in the geotechnical and post-tensioning industry. Throughout his extensive career at DYWIDAG, he has held various leadership roles and has been key in expanding international technical and sales teams. Mike continues to be an active contributor to the industry through his work with the Association of Drilled Shaft Contractors (ADSC), Deep Foundations Institute (DFI), and Post-Tensioning Institute (PTI).

 Tell us about DYWIDAG and what the company does?

 DYWIDAG is a global leader in structural and geotechnical engineering solutions. We were founded in Germany in 1865 and we are proud of the long legacy of innovation and infrastructure reinforcement that the company possesses. We have operations in over 50 countries and employ more than 1,600 professionals. DYWIDAG specializes in post-tensioning, stay cable, concrete, and geotechnical systems. Our mission is to make infrastructure safer, stronger, and smarter and that is reflected in our iconic projects like the Golden Gate Bridge, One World Trade Center and the Gordie Howe International Bridge, just to name three.

 Why did DYWIDAG choose Pennsylvania for its newest facility?

 Pottstown Pennsylvania’s strategic location in the Northeast places DYWIDAG close to major infrastructure hubs such as Philadelphia and New York City, making it an ideal choice to support fast-growing demand across the region. The new facility, located in the former Bethlehem Steel complex, builds on the area’s industrial legacy and underscores DYWIDAG’s commitment to revitalizing the local economy. By breathing new life into this historic manufacturing site, we are increasing production capacity and improving delivery times and contributing to the long-term economic rejuvenation of the region.

 

 How does this facility fit into DYWIDAG’s broader U.S. growth strategy?

 This is a key milestone in our long-term U.S. expansion. It not only strengthens our ability to supply our engineering solutions more efficiently, but it also reinforces our commitment to offering localized support and expertise. The Northeast is a burgeoning for infrastructure development and increasing demand for advanced geotechnical and structural solutions.

 Locating our newest facility in Pennsylvania positions DYWIDAG at the heart of this growth and allows us to better support regional projects with faster delivery times, enhanced production capabilities and more responsive customer service. By investing in infrastructure, people and product availability in the U.S., we are laying the groundwork for the next level of sustainable growth for the company.

 Tell us about the THREADBAR system being produced here?

 THREADBAR is the only ASTM A722-compliant reinforcement system available in the U.S. market. It’s a high-performance, versatile solution used in geotechnical and post-tensioning applications around the world. THREADBAR reinforced concrete systems provide high strength reinforcement for faster construction times, higher quality and lower project costs.

 Due to our higher capacity reinforcement bars, compared to traditional reinforcement, DYWIDAG reduces steel congestion in structural applications, resulting in easier concrete placement and the potential for smaller columns and more slender shear walls. The Pennsylvania facility enables us to now maintain a robust regional stock, ensuring shorter lead times and reliable supply for projects of all sizes.

 

 Tell us about the team leading this new phase of growth.We’ve brought on three seasoned professionals to lead our Northeast operations:

 * Maureen Merson, a Geotechnical Engineer, has deep project lifecycle knowledge. She is an active leader in the engineering community, serving as President of the Mohawk-Hudson Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers
* Rey Clavel, Geotechnical Sales Engineer, brings over two decades of field, engineering, and quality control-certified construction management expertise.
* Steve Scott, Northeast Sales Manager, brings 14 years of technical sales experience. With strong expertise in product specification, field exploration and testing, Steve will play a key role in driving market development across the region.

 Together, they represent the next generation of DYWIDAG’s customer-first mindset and technical excellence across both public and private infrastructure sectors.

 DYWIDAG has a long legacy of innovation. How does innovation factor into the company’s identity today?

 With 160 years of experience, DYWIDAG continues to evolve through innovation. We’re leading the way in advanced reinforcement systems, data-driven monitoring, and corrosion protection technologies. Our solutions, like our THREADBAR systems and load monitoring instrumentation, are designed for modern infrastructure challenges. We don’t just supply products; we engineer smarter, safer and more sustainable outcomes.
