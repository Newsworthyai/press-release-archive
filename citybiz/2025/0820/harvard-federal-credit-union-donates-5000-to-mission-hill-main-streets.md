 “Our newest branch, located at the corner of Mission Hill and Longwood, reinforces our commitment to empower our members to make a positive impact in their lives and communities,” said Craig Leonard, CEO of Harvard Federal Credit Union. “This new space will allow us to better serve the Longwood hospitals and provide neighborhood residents with the tools, resources and education to fit their financial needs, and we’re excited to do so with the help of Mission Hill Main Streets.”

 Harvard Federal Credit Union also made a $5,000 donation to Mission Hill Main Streets, a non-profit organization that works with local businesses, residents and community organizations to revitalize its local shopping district which spans Tremont Street, from Roxbury Crossing to Brigham Circle and Huntington Avenue, from Longwood Avenue to South Huntington and Heath Street.

 “Community means everything to us here in our close-knit Mission Hill neighborhood,” said Courtney Wright, executive director of Mission Hill Main Streets. “Harvard Federal Credit Union shares those same core values and principles, and it’s comforting to know that residents and business owners will have even more convenient and accessible banking options, and in-person access to knowledgeable staff that can help them best navigate their financial journey.”

 Harvard FCU has served the health care providers in the Longwood Medical Area for decades. Now, for the first time in its 86-year history, Harvard Federal Credit Union can also serve eligible residents outside of the Harvard University network due to its new federal charter.
