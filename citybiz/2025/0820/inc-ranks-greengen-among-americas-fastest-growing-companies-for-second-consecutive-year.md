# Inc. Ranks GreenGen Among America’s Fastest-Growing Companies for Second Consecutive Year

GreenGen, a global leader in energy and resilience solutions, today announced its inclusion on Inc. Magazine’s prestigious Inc. 5000 list for the second year in a row. The annual ranking honors the nation’s fastest-growing privately held businesses, with GreenGen’s repeat placement highlighting its sustained growth, market leadership, and proven ability to deliver innovative solutions that generate measurable ROI for clients worldwide.

 “Earning a spot on the Inc. 5000 list for two years running validates that our people-first, mission-driven approach isn’t just good business, it’s delivering exceptional results,” said Brad Dockser, CEO and Co-Founder of GreenGen. “We’ve built something special, a company that is growing rapidly while staying grounded in its purpose. This recognition belongs to every member of our team who shares our vision and drives it forward every day.”

 GreenGen’s success extends far beyond revenue metrics. The company has cultivated an award-winning workplace culture, recognized recently by both Inc. magazine and the Washington Business Journal as a top place to work. This year’s Inc. 5000 recognition comes as the company celebrates two milestones:

 * GreenGen was selected as the only small business awarded to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ $3 billion ESPC IV contract, enabling the company to support energy and water modernization efforts across the nation’s aging federal building portfolio.

* In collaboration with Conduit Capital U.S. and Climate First Bancorp, Sustainable Credit Partners was launched, a new green lending program designed to unlock financing for energy efficiency and decarbonization in mid-market commercial buildings.

 These achievements demonstrate the many ways GreenGen is driving impact by embedding sustainability into the full real estate lifecycle and how the energy transition creates significant value for property owners and investors worldwide. The Inc. 5000 rankings are determined by percentage revenue growth over a three-year period, making consecutive appearances particularly rare and meaningful. GreenGen’s ability to maintain its upward trajectory while broadening its client base and service offerings showcases the scalability of its business model and values-driven approach.

 “What sets GreenGen apart isn’t just how fast we’re growing, it’s how we’re choosing to grow,” added Dockser. “We’re showing that it’s possible to scale with purpose, invest in people, and deliver real financial and climate impact all at once. That’s what sustainable success looks like.”
