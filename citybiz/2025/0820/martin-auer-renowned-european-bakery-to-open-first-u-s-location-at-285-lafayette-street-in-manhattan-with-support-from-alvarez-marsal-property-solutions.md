# Martin Auer, Renowned European Bakery, to Open First U.S. Location at 285 Lafayette Street in Manhattan, with Support from Alvarez &amp; Marsal Property Solutions

Alvarez & Marsal Property Solutions (AM-PS), a fully integrated, real estate advisory firm, announced today the signing of a 10-year lease with Martin Auer, the beloved Austrian bakery, for its first U.S. location at 285 Lafayette Street in New York City’s SoHo neighborhood. The deal includes 3,200 square feet of ground-floor retail space and an additional 500 square feet on the lower level.

 AM-PS was retained by Kushner Companies, the property’s ownership entity, to reposition the vacant space and identify a tenant aligned with the building’s legacy and SoHo’s unique retail identity. The lease was executed in May 2025.

 Founded in Graz, Austria, Martin Auer is known for its handcrafted breads, pastries, and café offerings. With more than 50 locations across Europe, the bakery’s U.S. flagship marks a major milestone in its global expansion strategy. The Lafayette Street location will bring Martin Auer’s signature European café culture to one of Manhattan’s most vibrant and high-foot-traffic corridors.

 “Martin Auer is a brand that brings both quality and authenticity to the table, and 285 Lafayette offers the perfect environment for its New York debut,” said Max Swerdloff, Senior Analyst at AM-PS, who represented the landlord alongside Matthew Krell. “This deal highlights the value of strategic repositioning and a curated tenant mix to elevate retail assets in legacy neighborhoods.”

 Kristen Fox of CBRE represented Martin Auer as the tenant broker.

 This transaction underscores AM-PS’s expertise in helping property owners revitalize key retail spaces and attract best-in-class tenants from around the globe.
