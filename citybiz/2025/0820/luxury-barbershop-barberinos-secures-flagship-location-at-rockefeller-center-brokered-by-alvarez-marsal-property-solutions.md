# Luxury Barbershop Barberino’s Secures Flagship Location at Rockefeller Center, Brokered by Alvarez &amp; Marsal Property Solutions

Alvarez & Marsal Property Solutions (AM-PS), a fully integrated real estate advisory firm, announced today the signing of a new 10-year lease on behalf of Barberino’s, the luxury Italian barbershop and grooming brand, at 55 West 49th Street at 30 Rockefeller Plaza.

 Barberino’s, known for its elevated approach to men’s haircare, skincare, and grooming, has signed for 645 square feet at the landmark Midtown property. This will be the brand’s second U.S. location and serve as its New York City flagship, reinforcing its ambition to become the premier name in men’s grooming on both sides of the Atlantic.

 Founded in Italy, Barberino’s operates 16 stores across the country, offering an upscale barbershop experience paired with premium grooming products. Its expansion into New York began with its U.S. debut at 520 Madison Avenue, also owned by Tishman Speyer, and this latest move into Rockefeller Center marks a major milestone for the company.

 “Barberino’s will bring a first-of-its-kind premium grooming experience to Rockefeller Center. In a world that is increasingly digital, automated, and anonymous, neighborhood stores with a human-centered focus are more necessary than ever, as spaces that foster real relationships, authentic encounters, and a sense of belonging. We are proud to bring this vision to life in such an iconic location as Rockefeller Center,” said Michele Callegari, co-founder and CEO of Barberino’s.

 Scott Schuster, of Schuster Group Inc., and Lucas Kooyman, of AM-PS, represented Barberino’s in the transaction. Tishman Speyer was represented in-house by Reed Zukerman.

 “There are few assets that are as quintessentially New York as Rockefeller Center,” said Kooyman. “The new boutique, surrounded by other luxury tenants and catering to a dynamic mix of office workers, New Yorkers and visitors, will further cement Barberino’s as a top operator in Manhattan’s haircare, skincare, and grooming sector. We were thrilled to work hand-in-hand with Tishman Speyer to secure a location for Barberino’s in such an iconic landmark.”

 “Barberino’s decision to establish a presence at Rockefeller Center underscores the continued demand for high-quality, heritage-driven brands on campus,” said EB Kelly, Senior Managing Director, Tishman Speyer and Head of Rockefeller Center. “Their arrival strengthens the Center’s diverse retail mix and supports our vision of Rockefeller Center as a destination where tradition and innovation meet.”

 Adorned with the brand’s signature shade of green, the shop will feature three barber chairs and offer tailored wellness services including haircuts, shaves, beard trims, shampooing and hot towel service to accommodate diverse preferences and time constraints. It will also boast their full line of in-house haircare and skincare products, as well as a curated selection of offerings from high-end brand partnerships, and is slated to open at Rockefeller Center this fall.

 Blending Italian grooming traditions with innovative techniques, Barberino’s operates 18 shops in Italy across major cities including Milan, Turin and Rome, and it opened its first international location in Seoul in 2023.

 This marks the second transaction that Schuster and Kooyman have completed within the Tishman Speyer portfolio, showcasing their continued success in placing global luxury and lifestyle brands into high-profile retail destinations.
