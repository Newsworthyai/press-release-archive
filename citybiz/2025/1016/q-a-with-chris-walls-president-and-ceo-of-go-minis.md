# Q&amp;A with Chris Walls, President and CEO of Go Mini’s

Chris Walls is the President and CEO of Go Mini’s, one of North America’s fastest-growing portable storage franchise brands. He joined the company in 2020, bringing a strong background in law and corporate operations. After spending eight years as a trial attorney, Walls transitioned into business leadership roles with both startups and public companies, where he gained extensive experience in managing operations and driving growth.

 Since taking on the position, Walls has guided Go Mini’s through a major expansion, surpassing 100 sold territories and strengthening its position as a leading alternative to traditional self-storage. Under his leadership, the brand has modernized its operations, streamlined the customer experience through online booking and flexible delivery options, and introduced industry-leading 20-foot containers. Driven by a customer-first philosophy, Walls remains focused on growing Go Mini’s footprint across North America and supporting franchise owners as they meet the rising demand for portable storage solutions.

 What inspired Go Mini’s to partner with Move For Hunger, and how did this collaboration come together?

 Go Mini’s has always encouraged local community engagement, and our partnership with Move For Hunger amplifies that mission by extending our reach from neighborhood initiatives to nationwide impact. Rooted in shared values of sustainability and social responsibility, this collaboration was a natural fit. Together, we’re working to reduce food waste and support families facing hunger.

 How do you see this partnership aligning with Go Mini’s broader mission or brand values beyond storage solutions?

 Move For Hunger’s innovative approach is leveraging the relocation industry to collect and deliver nonperishable food, which aligns seamlessly with Go Mini’s expansive franchise network and national presence. While the partnership remains open-ended, our commitment is clear: we aim to foster a lasting relationship that adapts and grows with the evolving needs of the communities we serve.

 Can you share more details about the pilot markets—why they were chosen and what success looks like for this initial phase?

 We are rolling this program out across all of our markets by enabling all customers to donate at the time of check out with their Go Mini’s Rental. Go Mini’s will also be contributing as well and that will enable over 20,000 meals to be delivered to those in need across its network territories.

 What role do you envision Go Mini’s franchisees playing in making this program successful at the local level?

 Our franchisees play a vital role in the success of the program. Their involvement includes educating customers about the partnership and how to contribute a monetary donation at checkout, collecting nonperishable food items during the holiday season, and coordinating food pickups and deliveries. They’re also encouraged to organize seasonal food drives to further support their local communities.

 Looking ahead, are there any plans to expand Go Mini’s charitable initiatives beyond Move For Hunger, or could this serve as a model for future community partnerships?

 Although this partnership is still in its early stages, the potential for future expansion is promising. We’re excited to integrate the Move For Hunger initiative into our marketing and operational strategies as a way to deepen community engagement across the country.
