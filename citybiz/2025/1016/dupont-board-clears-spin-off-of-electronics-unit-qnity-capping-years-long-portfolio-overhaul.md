# DuPont Board Clears Spin-Off of Electronics Unit Qnity, Capping Years-Long Portfolio Overhaul

DuPont de Nemours said its board has approved the long-awaited separation of its electronics segment into a new publicly traded company, Qnity Electronics, marking the culmination of the materials giant’s multiyear effort to streamline its portfolio and sharpen its focus on specialty industrial businesses.

 Under the plan, DuPont will distribute all outstanding shares of Qnity common stock to its shareholders in a pro rata dividend, with the transaction expected to close Nov. 1. Investors of record as of Oct. 22 will receive one share of Qnity stock for every two shares of DuPont stock they own. Fractional shares will be settled in cash.

 In connection with the spin-off, Qnity’s board approved a $4.12 billion cash dividend to be paid to DuPont, along with a $66 million pre-funded interest deposit and any returns on funds held in escrow related to Qnity’s debt.

 Qnity common stock will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “Q.” “When-issued” trading will begin Oct. 27 under the temporary symbol “Q WI” and continue through Oct. 31, while regular trading is slated to start Nov. 3. During that same period, DuPont shares will trade in two markets: “regular-way” under DD, which carries the right to receive Qnity shares, and “ex-distribution” under DD WI, which does not. The company cautioned that investors who sell DuPont stock in the regular market before the distribution date will forfeit their right to Qnity shares.

DuPont said shareholders don’t need to take any action to receive Qnity stock, though it advised investors to consult their financial and tax advisers about potential implications of the transaction, including international tax considerations and the trading mechanics during the when-issued period.

 The separation, first announced earlier this year, will complete DuPont’s pivot toward its core industrial and specialty materials portfolio, which includes segments such as water solutions, safety protection, and advanced polymers. Qnity, meanwhile, will emerge as a standalone electronics-focused company positioned to serve the fast-growing semiconductor, display, and advanced materials markets.

 Analysts view the move as part of DuPont’s broader effort to improve operational focus and unlock value after years of divestitures and restructurings following its 2017 merger and subsequent breakup with Dow and Corteva. The newly formed Qnity will inherit DuPont’s electronics technologies, including materials used in chip fabrication and flexible displays—key sectors expected to benefit from rising global demand for artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, and advanced computing.

 With the spin-off’s completion, DuPont will close a chapter of portfolio reshaping that began nearly a decade ago, emerging as a more tightly focused manufacturing and specialty materials company, while Qnity steps into public markets as a pure-play electronics supplier at the center of the global technology supply chain.
