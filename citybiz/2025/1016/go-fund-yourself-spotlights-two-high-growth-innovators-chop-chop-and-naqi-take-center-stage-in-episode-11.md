# Go Fund Yourself Spotlights Two High-Growth Innovators: Chop Chop and NAQI Take Center Stage in Episode 11

As traditional funding routes grow more crowded and competitive, a new platform is emerging—one that blends national television exposure, public investment, and entrepreneurial storytelling. Go Fund Yourself, airing on Cheddar TV, has rapidly evolved into a launchpad where early-stage companies can secure not only capital, but community, customers, and nationwide validation.

 With Episode 11 airing October 16 at 7PM ET, two startups—Chop Chop and NAQI—will take the stage, each offering a distinctly different vision of the future. One seeks to redefine restaurant economics; the other aims to change how humans interact with technology.

 Why Go Fund Yourself Is Reshaping Startup Funding

 Unlike traditional pitch shows, Go Fund Yourself does more than place founders in front of investors—it invites the public to participate. The model blends exposure, equity opportunity, and open-access entrepreneurship, allowing viewers to become backers through active investment portals.

 Rather than asking, “Will the judges buy in?” the show asks, “Will the world?”

 This democratized approach is drawing a new wave of founders—those seeking traction, not just term sheets—and investors who value market visibility as much as valuation.

 At the helm of each episode is a distinguished group of Titans — Rory Cutaia, David Meltzer, and Jayson Waller — all accomplished CEOs, investors, and market leaders with decades of exits and/or IPOs behind them. Their on-air evaluations extend far beyond funding decisions; they offer strategic insight, commercial rigor, and a real-time pulse on where capital is moving next.

 

 Chop Chop: Restoring Control to Independent Restaurants

 The restaurant industry has long struggled under the weight of third-party delivery platforms that claim up to 30% commissions per order. Chop Chop enters the market with a decisive counterstrategy: a subscription-based delivery solution that empowers restaurants to own their customer relationships, protect their margins, and streamline digital orders.

 Key Value Proposition:

 * No commission fees
* Faster, direct ordering experience
* Ownership of customer data and loyalty

 In a post-pandemic landscape where delivery has become essential, Chop Chop offers independent operators something they rarely receive from aggregators—leverage. For local eateries competing against corporate chains, this model represents both economic protection and scalable growth.

 NAQI: A New Frontier in Neural Interface Technology

 While Chop Chop tackles tangible industry pain, NAQI looks ahead to the interface of human intention and digital action. The company’s neural-earbud platform enables non-invasive, hands-free control of devices through cognitive signals—no screens, no touch, no implants.

 Potential Market Impact:

 * Accessibility and assistive technology
* Gaming and immersive computing
* Productivity without physical interaction

 By translating intent directly into command, NAQI is positioning itself at the forefront of human-machine evolution. What once existed only in speculative fiction is now heading toward consumer hardware—and Episode 11 may mark the moment investors take notice on a national stage.

 A New Type of Stage for Founders and Investors

 Every episode of Go Fund Yourself fuels a broader movement—one where entrepreneurs gain exposure before capital, and where investors see real-time market reactions before making decisions.

 A Titan on the show summarized it simply: “We’re not just investing in products. We’re investing in companies that can redefine what’s possible.”
