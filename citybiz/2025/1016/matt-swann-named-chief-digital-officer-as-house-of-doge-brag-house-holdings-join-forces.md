# Matt Swann Named Chief Digital Officer as House of Doge &amp; Brag House Holdings Join Forces

House of Doge, the official corporate arm of the Dogecoin Foundation, together with merger partner Brag House Holdings, today announced the appointment of Matt Swann as Chief Digital Officer (CDO). Following the Company’s completion of the pending merger with Brag House, Mr. Swann is expected to play a pivotal role as Chief Digital Officer for the combined company, driving digital-asset infrastructure and fan ownership initiatives across all verticals. Swann, a globally recognized technology leader with executive experience at Amazon, Booking.com, StubHub, and Nubank, will lead House of Doge’s digital transformation as it scales its initiatives across payments, tokenization, and real-world asset (RWA) markets.

 Swann brings a deep background in building and transforming digital ecosystems across fintech, e-commerce, and blockchain innovation. He has served as a CTO, Board Member, and Technical Advisor to some of the world’s most dynamic technology companies, guiding the modernization of products, platforms, and payments at scale. He currently serves on the Board of Thredd Payments, where he chairs the Technology Committee, advancing next-generation digital payments infrastructure. Additionally, he is a member of the Board of Heritage Distilling Holding Company, Inc. / IP Strategy(NASDAQ:IP), where he leads the Cryptocurrency Committee in partnership with Story Foundation to integrate blockchain solutions within consumer markets. His combined experience at the intersection of fintech, payments, and crypto innovation aligns directly with House of Doge’s mission to build a scalable and institutionally integrated Dogecoin ecosystem.

 Swann joins House of Doge during a pivotal phase in its evolution following its announced merger with Brag House Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: TBH) – a transaction that will mark Dogecoin’s transition from a community-powered movement into an institutional-grade ecosystem supporting payment processing, tokenization, licensing, and yield-driven products.

 Driving Digital Transformation Across Core Verticals As CDO, Swann will oversee the development and integration of next-generation digital capabilities that extend Dogecoin’s reach across global financial and consumer networks. His leadership will focus on several key verticals:

 * Payments Infrastructure & Crypto Exchange Integration – Establishing advanced payment rails that connect merchants, exchanges, and consumers through seamless Dogecoin-enabled transactions, settlement systems, and cross-border capabilities.
* Sports & Entertainment – Unlocking new models for fan ownership and engagement.
* Real-World Asset Tokenization (RWA) – Transforming real estate, commodities, and other high-value cultural assets into tradable digital markets, expanding the utility of Dogecoin beyond traditional finance.

 “We are Builders of the Dogecoin Economy,” said Swann. “Our focus is community utility at an institutional scale and tokenization that unlocks real markets, keeping real-world assets in motion under a clear, usable model of cultural finance. The invitation is open to partners and creators who want to build with us. Give people a coin they can use. Give institutions rails. Let the market do the rest.”

 “Matt’s leadership at the intersection of technology and finance will be instrumental as House of Doge builds scalable digital infrastructure for Dogecoin,” said Marco Margiotta, CEO of House of Doge. “His unmatched track record in scaling global fintech and payments platforms positions him perfectly to accelerate our mission—changing how people pay, how fans own, and how Dogecoin powers the world economy.”

 “Fan engagement and creating meaningful digital experiences have always been at the heart of Brag House,” said Lavell Juan Malloy II, chairman and CEO of Brag House Holdings Inc. “Our merger with House of Doge takes that mission a step further, transforming fans from participants into owners. Matt’s expertise in building large-scale digital and payment ecosystems reinforces this vision and accelerates our plan to create a next-generation fan economy across entertainment, gaming, and real-world assets.”
