# Transformative $2 Billion Midtown Park Wins City Approval, Ushering in New Era of Walkable Urban Living

Rosso Development, Midtown Development, and Proper Hospitality announce that the transformative $2 billion Midtown Park master plan—a multi-tower, two phase development introducing residences, offices, dining, retail, parks, and one of the most ambitious racquet and padel destinations in the U.S.—has officially received approval from the City of Miami’s Urban Development Review Board. This milestone clears the way for the first phase of the five-acre mixed-use community that will reshape Midtown into a vibrant, walkable hub connecting Wynwood and the Design District.

 The approved master plan will bring 924 residential units, 60,000 square feet of office space, and over 120,000 square feet of designer retail, anchored by two major public plazas and a network of pedestrian-oriented streetscapes that prioritize walkability and public life. It will also introduce a world-class racquet and padel club featuring 8 courts, operated by ULTRA Padel. The project will rise across two 28-story towers, two 17-story towers, and a low-rise retail structure, with phased delivery and a temporary two-acre ULTRA Padel pop-up set to activate the site as construction begins.

 “This is Miami’s most significant mixed-use redevelopment and will transform the future of urban living in the area,” said Carlos Rosso, Founder & CEO of Rosso Development. “We envisioned a landmark destination where culture, wellness, and open green space come together to enhance Midtown’s walkable character. This project will transform a long-vacant five-acre site into an activated social hub that seamlessly links the Design District, Midtown, and Wynwood.”

 Midtown Park Residences by Proper, located at 3055 N Miami Ave, is the first building within the approved master plan. Designed by Arquitectonica with interiors by Meyer Davis Studio, the 28-story tower will deliver 288 Proper-branded residences, ranging from studios to three-bedroom homes, plus exclusive penthouses with private rooftop gardens and pools.

 The tower’s 40,000 square feet of private amenities include a tropical pool deck with a signature restaurant and bar, private pickleball court, state-of-the-art fitness center, yoga and meditation garden, spa pool, co-working spaces, a kids club, and a communal vegetable garden designed by Naturalficial. Residents will also enjoy curated programming and cultural experiences through a Proper Culture Concierge, plus exclusive access to events across Proper Hospitality’s global portfolio, including the newly opened Shelborne by Proper on Miami Beach.

Having a brand like Proper enter the market is a tremendous vote of confidence in the neighborhood’s continued evolution, solidifying its status as one of Miami’s most vibrant and design-forward districts.”
