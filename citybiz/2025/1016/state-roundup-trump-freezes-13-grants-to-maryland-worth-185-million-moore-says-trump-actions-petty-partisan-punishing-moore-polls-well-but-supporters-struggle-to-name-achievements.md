 OP-ED: BALTIMORE COUNTY’s BRAZEN ATTEMPT TO HIDE THE TRUTH: In 47 years of working in and writing about local government in Maryland, I’ve never seen a more brazen assault on fundamental principles of transparency and accountability than the efforts by the administrations of former Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski and current County Executive Kathy Klausmeier to hide from the public the reason that the county paid Olszewski’s former chief of staff, Patrick J. Murray, $100,000 to settle a lawsuit initiated by the county. David Plymyer/Baltimore Brew.
