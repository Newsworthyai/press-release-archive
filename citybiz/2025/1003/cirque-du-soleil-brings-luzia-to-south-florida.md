 February 19 to April 25, 2026

 General on sale starts October 2, 2025

 Cirque du Soleil returns to South Florida with its delightfully-imaginative and visually-stunning production LUZIA, a waking dream of Mexico. Opening on February 19, audiences are invited under the famed Big Top at 1/ST’s Gulfstream Park to escape to an imaginary Mexico – a sumptuous world suspended between dreams and reality. Join the waitlist via Fever here starting today to receive exclusive access to pre-sales. The pre-sale will take place on October 1st for one day only, giving waitlist members the opportunity to secure the best seats before anyone else. Tickets for the general public will be available beginning October 2nd.

 In a series of grand visual surprises and breathtaking acrobatic performances, LUZIA takes audiences on a surrealistic journey through a vibrant world filled with wonders, playfulness and striking artistry. Smoothly passing from an old movie set to the ocean to a smoky dance hall or an arid desert, LUZIA cleverly brings to the stage multiple places, faces and sounds of Mexico taken from both tradition and modernity. Rich in awe- inspiring moments, LUZIA enchants by incorporating rain into acrobatic and artistic scenes – a first for a Cirque du Soleil touring production.

 With mesmerizing and refreshing acrobatic performances, LUZIA brings traditional and contemporary circus disciplines to a whole new level. Cyr Wheel artists perform the unprecedented feat of rolling and spinning under the rain, while an aerialist suspended from a Trapeze flies and twirls through pouring showers. Hoop Diving is taken onto gigantic treadmills, expanding exponentially the speed and amount of daring leaps executed. Jaw-dropping highlights include a male contortionist skillfully twisting his body in the world’s most unimaginable positions, a powerful Aerial Straps specialist defying the laws of gravity at the center of a cenote (natural sinkhole), a juggler tossing seven pins at breakneck speed, and two football (soccer) freestylers deftly mixing street dance with mind-blowing ball manipulation.   Ticket Information Tickets for the South Florida performances of LUZIA at Gulfstream Park will be available starting October 1st exclusively to those who joined the waitlist via the Fever Website or Fever App. The public on-sale begins October 2nd, so fans are encouraged to join the waitlist early for priority access.

 More about LUZIA – A waking dream of Mexico Written and directed by Daniele Finzi Pasca, in association with Brigitte Poupart, LUZIA takes you to an imaginary Mexico, like in a waking dream, where light (“luz” in Spanish) quenches the spirit and rain (“lluvia”) soothes the soul.
