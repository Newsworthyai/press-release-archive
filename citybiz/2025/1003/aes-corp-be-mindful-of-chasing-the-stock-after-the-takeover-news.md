# AES Corp.: Be Mindful of Chasing the Stock After the Takeover News

The AES Corporation has suddenly found itself back in the spotlight after reports surfaced that Global Infrastructure Partners, now part of BlackRock, is preparing a $38 billion acquisition. The news sent shares higher, erasing months of weakness that had plagued renewables-related stocks. Yet, as is often the case in markets, the question investors face is whether this rally represents the start of a new chapter—or the closing credits for near-term gains.

 AES has long been a curious case among utilities. Unlike its more traditional, regulated peers, AES derives most of its revenue from non-regulated operations. That structure has always made its cash flows more volatile, and at times, less attractive to risk-averse investors. The stock has also labored under the weight of heavy debt—more than $30 billion as of the second quarter of 2025—an overhang that has suppressed its valuation even when renewable energy was in vogue. Investors who purchased shares at $10 earlier this year have already reaped a windfall, with gains of more than 50% in just a few months. However, with the latest surge, AES now trades near the rumored acquisition value, leaving little room for speculators hoping to capitalize on a deal premium.

 The proposed takeover does make strategic sense. For a firm like GIP, which specializes in owning and optimizing infrastructure assets, AES’s portfolio of subsidiaries provides both scale and optionality. Non-recourse debt at the subsidiary level means risk can be ring-fenced, while asset sales could help rationalize the structure. GIP has ample experience reshuffling portfolios, and AES’s far-flung mix of assets would likely be more valuable in the hands of an infrastructure consolidator than a standalone public company. Importantly, ownership by a deep-pocketed sponsor would lower financing costs, improve credit terms, and provide flexibility that has long eluded AES under public-market scrutiny.

 But enthusiasm must be tempered by the math. At yesterday’s close, AES’s enterprise value stood at roughly $39.9 billion, already above the $38 billion price tag mentioned in reports. That suggests traders have priced in not only the deal itself but perhaps even a small bump in value—leaving limited upside for newcomers. Meanwhile, AES trades at an EV/EBITDA multiple that is broadly in line with its peers, despite higher leverage, more non-regulated exposure, and greater jurisdictional risk. In other words, the stock is no longer cheap relative to its fundamentals, even when considering takeover speculation.

 For income-focused investors, the dividend has long been part of AES’s allure. In 2024, payouts to common shareholders consumed nearly half a billion dollars, with additional distributions flowing to non-controlling interests. Under GIP’s ownership, that cash flow would likely be curtailed, freeing capital for debt management and strategic repositioning. While beneficial for long-term stability, it also means current shareholders should not count on dividends continuing in their present form once the company is folded into a private structure.

 The regulatory environment poses another question mark. AES’s global footprint reduces the risk of any single jurisdiction blocking the deal, but U.S. regulators have been more aggressive in scrutinizing large infrastructure acquisitions. The diversified portfolio should help smooth the approval process, but it is still a factor that investors need to keep in mind. Moreover, internal resistance from AES management cannot be discounted, given that consolidation may render some layers of leadership redundant. Still, fiduciary duty obliges management to act in the best interest of shareholders, and attractive personal incentives could smooth the path.

 For traders considering derivatives, the post-news jump leaves few easy plays. Selling puts no longer offers adequate premiums given the reduced volatility to the downside, while buying calls looks unattractive after the stock’s sharp rally. Even deep out-of-the-money contracts appear to have poor risk-reward given the slim probability of AES being valued much above the rumored $38 billion mark. Naked call writing may appeal to some speculators, but the tail risk remains significant, and the prudent investor should exercise caution.

 Ultimately, the story of AES at this point is less about growth or operational improvement and more about deal mechanics. The company has likely found its strategic owner, and GIP appears well-suited to extract value from a sprawling set of assets. But public-market investors hoping for another leg higher may be disappointed. With the stock already trading around the whispered acquisition value, most of the easy gains have been realized. For those who rode the stock up from its February lows, this may be the time to lock in profits rather than chase further upside. For others still on the sidelines, AES may no longer offer the asymmetric opportunity it once did.

 As with many takeover-driven rallies, discipline is essential. Chasing AES after its sharp run-up risks paying today for value that has already been factored into its price.
