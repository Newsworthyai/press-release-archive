 Why were you inspired to create the Founders Arena?

 I’ve always believed that fintech became the “catch-up” strategy for financial services firms. Then AI entered the scene, and it was clear the industry needed something more focused. I didn’t want to build just another accelerator with pitch competitions. To me what really mattered was creating smaller communities where true relationships drive growth – not just investments. Where entrepreneurs meet the right product buyers and accelerate their sales cycles. Founders don’t need more noise, they need the right doors opened.

 That’s why we built the Founders Arena: to connect founders directly with decision-makers in the investment world, and help them grow thriving businesses.

 What challenges did the team face in the early stages?

 Like any startup, credibility and awareness were initial hurdles. Could we convince the world’s most promising wealthtech companies to come to Arlington, Texas? That took building trust locally, across local stakeholders, city leaders, and potential investors. It also meant thinking globally, connecting with founders who were taking a bet on us. We also had to prove this wasn’t just another event series or another accelerator. We wanted to be unique in a world full of showcases, focused on results not than hype and name. And we found success in all of this, and it remains part of our identity.

 How did the first cohort respond, and how have you tweaked the programming?

 The first cohort told us it felt like being handed the keys to the right rooms. In other words, we opened doors for them they never knew existed. That validation meant everything. We didn’t know how it would go so we were taking a chance on the cohort just as much as they were taking a chance on us.

 Now we look back on the initial cohort and couldn’t be prouder of their success. The numbers show that those companies doubled their revenue since joining. And based on their feedback, we doubled down on matchmaking and direct sales support. Every tweak since has been about cutting out distractions and keeping founders focused on growth so they can build their companies for the long term.

 How has the Founders Arena grown over the past two years? What’s next?

 In just two years, we’ve hosted four cohorts, attracted companies from across the globe, and built deep partnerships with corporates and financial institutions. Out of our first 18 companies, four have already exited— a record we’re proud of. What’s next? We’re launching a for-profit sidecar to extend our investment reach, scaling our Arlington base into a full innovation hub, and continuing to position the Founders Arena as the global growth platform for wealthtech not just in Texas but nationally, and then, hopefully, globally.

 What has the response been from cohort companies and the wealthtech community?

 Our founders have been our biggest advocates. They leave with more than contacts—they leave with access that leads to customers, capital, and traction. They also leave with relationships with each other where they can share ideas and insights, and learn from what they are doing. Some of the best mentors are other founders — that peer community is invaluable.”

 Many sharpened their go-to-market strategies, expanded their networks, and secured funding more quickly due to these connections. And the wider wealthtech community, whether corporate investors or advisors, have really embraced us. They now come to us because they see the value of being close to the startups shaping the future of wealth management.

 Turning to Texas innovation, how has Founders Arena influenced Arlington and DFW’s ecosystem?

 Arlington and DFW were already strong in healthcare and corporate innovation. What we’ve done is layer in fintech and wealthtech, and that’s added new energy and visibility. By bringing in global startups, we’ve put Arlington on the map as more than a sports and entertainment city, it’s becoming a place where innovation, and innovative companies, grow, live, and thrive.

 How are local stakeholders, including city officials, involved in the Arena’s initiatives?

 Local leaders have been incredible partners. The City of Arlington and regional leaders have provided resources, shown up at events, and helped us connect with businesses and universities. And entrepreneurs who land here feel the difference—Texas is one of the friendliest places to build. That blend of public support and a welcoming business climate is powerful.

 How will the Founders Arena continue contributing to economic development and talent?

 This is the part that excites me the most. With the Texas Stock Exchange launching and more financial firms expanding into the region, we’ll see waves of new entrepreneurs spin out and start companies. We’re creating a magnet for talent and opportunity. Over time, this ecosystem will feed itself, and Founders Arena will be right at the center of it. Some of this was serendipitous but when I saw what was happening around Texas, it’s part of why I decided to start the Founders Arena in Arlington.

 What is the role of AI in wealthtech’s future? In the Founders Arena’s future?

 AI is already reshaping wealthtech—from personalizing advice to automating back-office processes. But it’s both our biggest opportunity and our biggest challenge. At the Founders Arena, our role is to help founders separate what’s real from what’s just noise, identifying when AI is solving a real problem versus when it’s just a shiny feature. Community, and the right people in and around the cohort, is the filter that makes that possible.

 What risks come with relying too heavily on AI for decision-making?

 The real risk is mistaking automation for judgment. Financial services run on trust, relationships, and accountability. AI can make things faster, but it can’t replace human judgment and connection. The balance is key: AI should support people, not replace the relationships.
