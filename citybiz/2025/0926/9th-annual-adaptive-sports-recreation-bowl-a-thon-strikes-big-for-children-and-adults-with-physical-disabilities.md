# 9th Annual Adaptive Sports &amp; Recreation Bowl-A-Thon Strikes Big for Children and Adults with Physical Disabilities

Co-sponsored by Memorial Foundation and Memorial Rehabilitation Institute, the community event raised funds to expand year-round adaptive sports, fitness and recreation programs.   Cheers and plenty of strikes filled Sparez Bowling Lanes as nearly 400 bowlers and community partners came together for the 9th Annual Memorial Rehab Adaptive Sports & Recreation Bowl-A-Thon, raising more than $30,000 to empower children and adults with physical disabilities to live active, engaged and independent lives.

 Thanks to this community-driven success, the Memorial Rehab Adaptive Sports & Recreation Program continues to grow, providing adaptive water sports, fitness classes, community events and support groups. Funds help cover equipment, transportation, and entry fees, eliminating financial obstacles so adaptive athletes of all ages can participate fully.

 “Every dollar raised creates opportunities for individuals with physical disabilities to thrive,” said Kelley Morris, president of the Memorial and Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital Foundations. “This event reflects our community’s generosity and shared commitment to inclusion and hope.”

 The program offers year-round adaptive therapy and recreational sports for individuals living with physical disabilities resulting from stroke, spinal cord or brain injury, amputation and other conditions. Activities include wheelchair tennis, adaptive bowling, cycling, rowing, mountain biking and fishing, helping participants in both inpatient and outpatient settings achieve independence, emotional recovery and community reintegration.

 The Bowl-A-Thon’s success was made possible through generous sponsors including Memorial Hospital Pembroke Medical Staff, Strive Recreational Therapy, OPC Prosthetic Centers, Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital Medical Staff, Hanger Clinic, Greenpoint Building, Memorial Hospital Miramar Medical Staff, Genset Fire and Security, Price Family Foundation, Comforts of Home, Universal Drywall and Plastering, Saltz Michelson Architects, Southwest Elevator Company, Labcorp, Trane Technologies, Ellie J. Builders and Southeast Society of Health-System Pharmacists.
