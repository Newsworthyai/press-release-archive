 Q2: For viewers who may not be familiar with The Associated, how does it support Baltimore?

 The Associated: Jewish Federation of Baltimore strengthens Jewish life by engaging and supporting community partners.

 Every year, The Associated raises tens of millions of dollars through its Annual Campaign to address the many community needs. We support and implement solutions that help us care for those who are struggling, combat antisemitism, create a just and inclusive world and ensure Jewish communities worldwide thrive.

 Dollars raised from the Annual Campaign help support the work of our network of agencies. We are there to provide a safety net and make sure that those who are struggling can meet life’s challenges. Whether it’s transportation to a doctor’s appointment for an older adult, an emergency loan to a family to pay a month’s rent, special help for a child with learning differences or an overnight shelter that keeps a victim of abuse safe, we are providing a safety net for those who need it most.

 In addition, The Associated is committed to strengthening the community in which we live. Our work includes addressing antisemitism, revitalizing neighborhoods in Park Heights, tackling food insecurity and leading conversations across race, faith and ethnic communities that build mutual understanding and respect.
