# WICE Unveils Bold Restructuring

WICE, a global organization founded in 1989 by Conservationist Daan Vreugdenhil, announced a revitalization of its mission, team, and model, ushering in a modern era of sustainable development.

 The organization will maintain WICE’s trusted legacy while expanding to meet today’s challenges as it redefines development, creating a new model for supporting long-term sustainability.

 With a renewed mission and global reach, WICE will advance community-centered solutions across health, nutrition, agriculture, food systems, AI, ecotourism, energy and environment, education, economic development and blockchain, governance, partnerships, and humanitarian assistance.

 “This transformation honors the work that came before us while recognizing the urgency to do more, and to do it differently,” said Emily Weeks, Ph.D., CEO and co-founder of WICE USA, formerly at USAID. “We’re blending decades of proven expertise with next-generation approaches to development that center people, prioritize local leadership, and embrace modern tools, and financing mechanisms.”

 The restructured organization blends its legacy credibility with a high-impact model.

 With 150+ experts across 100+ countries, the team has:

 * Managed $50B+ in government contracts
* Advised presidents and national leaders
* Partnered with 2,500+ organizations
* Delivered a century of combined results
* Proven ability to rapidly deploy anywhere

 WICE is an agile, decentralized consortium that prioritizes collaboration over competition, sharing skills and resources to deliver human-centered solutions at scale while fostering partnership, investment, and co-design with local communities.

 “What we’re really focused on is creating innovative and inclusive solutions to global challenges — making sure health, ecosystems, and livelihoods can thrive, that local capacity is leading the way, and that sustainable development actually delivers a prosperous, equitable, and resilient future for everyone,” said Dr. Ahmad Kablan, Ph.D., Vice President of WICE, formerly of USAID.

 “What makes WICE uniquely different is that we are not just adapting to the evolving global development landscape — we are helping lead its transformation. As the sector moves toward a new paradigm of collaborative frameworks that blend public and private capital to unlock billions in investment, WICE stands at the forefront, advancing climate resilience, clean energy, inclusive economic growth, and sustainable infrastructure.”

 “We are re-defining development – creating a bold new beginning. The world needs all hands on deck, and we are ready to lead,” Weeks said.
