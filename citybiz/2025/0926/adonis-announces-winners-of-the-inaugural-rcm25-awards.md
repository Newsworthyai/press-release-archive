# Adonis Announces Winners of the Inaugural RCM25 Awards

The winners of the inaugural RCM25 Awards have been announced, celebrating 75 standout leaders and teams who are driving innovation and excellence in revenue cycle management (RCM). The program was created by Adonis to shine a spotlight on these often-overlooked champions of healthcare operations.

 After receiving a strong pool of applications and nominations, Adonis conducted a thorough review process, including interviews with a number of finalists, and ultimately selected 25 winners in each of three categories. Winners were evaluated based on proven success in driving innovation, improving RCM performance, leveraging technology, demonstrating thought leadership, and implementing strategic processes that enhance revenue cycle efficiency. The three categories include:

 * Top RCM Leaders
* Top Billing Leaders
* Top RCM Teams

 These honorees represent the most innovative, effective, and dedicated professionals in RCM, those who ensure healthcare providers of all sizes and specialties. From ApolloMD and Commonwealth Pain & Spine to Redefine Management and Red Rock Surgery Center, they help deliver quality care by keeping operations efficient and financially sustainable.
