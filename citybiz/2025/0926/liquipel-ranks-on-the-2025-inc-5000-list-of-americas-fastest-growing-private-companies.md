# LIQUIPEL Ranks on the 2025 Inc. 5000 List of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies

Inc., the leading media brand and playbook for the entrepreneurs and business leaders shaping our future, today announced that LIQUIPEL has earned a spot on the annual Inc. 5000 list marking their sixth consecutive year on the most prestigious ranking of the fastest-growing private companies in America. The list provides a data-driven snapshot of the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Past honorees include companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Chobani, Under Armour, Timberland, Oracle, and Patagonia.

 “Making the Inc. 5000 list six years in a row is thanks to our amazing team and partners,” said Sam Winkler, co-founder and CEO of Liquipel. “We’re not just building phone protection—we’re creating power and technology products that are stylish, fashion-forward, and built for the future. From fast-charging solutions to sleek accessories that turn heads, our team is proving that tech can be both powerful and beautiful. With over $1 billion in retail sales and massive distribution across the world, this recognition is fuel for us to keep raising the bar and showing what happens when fashion and technology come together.”

 This year’s Inc. 5000 honorees have demonstrated exceptional growth while navigating economic uncertainty, inflationary pressure, and a fluctuating labor market. Among the top 500 companies on the list, the median three-year revenue growth rate reached 1,552 percent, and those companies have collectively added more than 48,678 jobs to the U.S. economy over the past three years.

 “Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” says Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm—they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”

Inc. will celebrate the honorees at the 2025 Inc. 5000 Conference & Gala, taking place October 22–24 in Phoenix, and the top 500 will be listed in the Fall issue of Inc. magazine.
