# TurningPoint Energy and Pivot Energy Launch New Solar Project in Baltimore Region, First of 16.6MW Portfolio In Maryland

Maryland’s Baltimore region has a new 2.9-megawatt direct current solar farm. A ribbon cutting ceremony was held at the Clarksville, Maryland solar site on Sept. 25 to celebrate the energization of the new community solar farm. Distinguished guests, as well as employees from TurningPoint Energy and Pivot Energy, joined community members to mark the completion of the solar project.

 The solar farm was developed by TPE, a leading greenfield developer in Maryland, and is owned and operated by Pivot, a national renewable energy provider and independent power producer. This solar farm is the first to go online in a six-project,16.6 MWdc, portfolio developed by TPE, and built, operated, and owned by Pivot.

 “We are committed to being the best-in-class developer and steward of the communities we serve, and this project is a testament to that commitment. By delivering clean energy and meaningful community investment, we’re proud to help Maryland move closer to its renewable energy goals while directly benefiting local residents,” said Salar Naini, President of TPE.

 With construction completed this summer, this project represents a significant addition to the state’s solar generating capacity and will play a role in helping Maryland achieve its 50% renewable electricity goal by 2030. It will generate approximately 4.25 million kilowatt hours (kWh) of affordable renewable energy annually, enough to power the equivalent of up to 370 Maryland homes. The solar array is made up of nearly 5,500 solar modules, enough to fill nearly 10 football fields.

 This project is part of Maryland’s innovative Community Solar Energy Generating System (“CSEGS”) Pilot Program, which expands access to clean, affordable energy. Community solar enables Baltimore Gas & Electric (BG&E) customers to gain access to lower-cost, renewable energy generated locally. Subscribers to this community solar farm will save an average of 10% off their electricity bill each year. Reflecting strong community engagement, the project is now fully subscribed, with 11 unique participants – including a local church – demonstrating local interest in shared renewable energy solutions.

 “In addition to renewable energy benefits, this solar farm will support dual-use solar – sheep grazing, native pollinator planting, and other efforts to ensure the long-term productivity of this land,” said Samantha Frick, Director of Community Relations and Impact, Pivot. “We are bringing real benefits to Howard County.”

 “Our BGE bills have been clear that we need to ramp up and diversify energy production right here in our own County. I’m thankful that the County Council was able to align its votes with its values and adopt zoning regulations that are among the most solar friendly in the State. We might not be a big County, but we are mighty when it comes to climate-forward solutions,” said Councilmember Deb Jung for Howard County, District 4.

 TPE and its partners are committed to making meaningful charitable community investments in every community where their solar projects are developed. Local organizations that are recipients of this Project’s community investment include: Autism Society of Maryland, Bryant Woods Elementary School PTA, Community Action Council of Howard County, Harpers Choice Middle School PTA, Howard County Conservancy, Maryland Fuel Fund, Neighbor Ride, and Wilde Lake Middle School PTA. These investments are designed to create lasting social value by supporting local nonprofits, educational initiatives, and essential services. As part of this broader portfolio’s commitment, TPE and Pivot are jointly investing $120,000 in community donations, reinforcing their dedication to strengthening the communities they serve.

 “The Fuel Fund of Maryland is thrilled to partner with organizations that expand access to energy solutions like solar that may help households save on their utility bills,” said Debbie Brown, Executive Director of the Fuel Fund of Maryland. “In 2025, we are especially grateful to Pivot for their generous support, contributing a total of $18,000, which will help keep 72 Maryland households connected and empowered.”
