# Make Waves for Water Safety at the YMCA Of South Florida’s Beach Ball 2025

The YMCA of South Florida is making waves this fall with its annual Beach Ball Gala, themed Olympian Tides, on Saturday, October 4 beginning with The Gathering at 6:30, followed by The Feast and continuing with The Bacchanalia at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, 1 Seminole Way in Hollywood to support the Y’s water safety and drowning prevention initiatives. Title Sponsor is the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino and Presenting Sponsor is Nicklaus Children’s.

 The Beach Ball Gala brings together more than 600 passionate community leaders, advocates, and supporters to raise critical funds that help save lives. Guests will enjoy a cocktail reception, dinner, live musical entertainment, dancing and a live and silent auction during this enchanting evening filled with inspiration, entertainment and purpose.

 All proceeds support financial assistance for the Y’s aquatics programs, which include free and subsidized swim lessons for underserved youth, wet and dry safety lessons, Swim for Jenny and resources for families to prevent drowning tragedies. With Florida still leading the nation in child drownings, the Y is committed to making sure every child and family has access to swim lessons, education and safe aquatic experiences, regardless of their background or ability to pay. The YMCA also highlights underwater hypoxic blackout which occurs when someone who is playing breath holding games experiences accidental blackout, leading to rapid drowning. This can happen to anyone of any age and is an even bigger risk for strong swimmers.

 “Because every life saved is a victory we all share, we must keep funding and improving our programs to continue providing swim lessons and water safety education to more children and their families,” said YMCA of South Florida CEO Sheryl A. Woods. “We appreciate the support of the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, Nicklaus Children’s and all our amazing sponsors. We couldn’t do what we do without them.”

 Select sponsorships and early bird tickets for Beach Ball 2025 are now available, including Diamond for $25,000, Platinum Plus for $15,000, Platinum for $10,000, Ruby for $7,500, Gold for $5,000 and Silver for $3,000.

 Florida leads the country in child drownings of all ages, with Broward and Miami-Dade counties reporting the most drowning deaths in the state. At least 40% of children have little or no swimming ability, a figure which rises to 64% among some minority groups. In addition, for every child who loses their life to drowning, another five receive emergency department care for nonfatal submersion injuries. The Y’s swimming programs are paramount because formal swimming lessons reduce the likelihood of childhood drowning by 88%. Annually, more than 50,000 children and adults are taught drowning prevention and water safety techniques at the YMCA of South Florida. Many of these lessons are funded through the Y’s Aquatic Financial Assistance Program, making them accessible to all. The Y has an eight-lesson drowning prevention program, where children learn to be safe in and around the water. The Y’s Mobile Aquatics program also travels to low-income neighborhoods to teach water safety to children and their caregivers.

 In addition to title sponsor Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino and presenting sponsor Nicklaus Children’s, Beach Ball 2025 is supported by Brown & Brown Insurance, Bacardi USA, Publix Super Markets Charities, Related Group, Milner, Spirit Airlines, Ryder, Club Med, ANF, Matrix, Gulf Building, JM Family Enterprises and Royal Caribbean Group, among others.
