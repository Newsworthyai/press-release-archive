WATERMEN OPPOSE PROPOSAL TO CUT STRIPED BASS CATCH BY 12%: Eastern Shore watermen packed Chesapeake College on Monday and overwhelmingly opposed draft striped bass rules that would trim total removals by 12 percent in 2026 and could add more closures.

 SMITH ISLANDERS FINALLY FULLY CONNECTED: After a $2 million effort to bring high-speed internet and 5G cell service to all of Smith Island was completed on Wednesday, one of Maryland’s most remote communities is fully connected. Katie Shepherd/The Washington Post.

 A NUMBER OF NEW LAWS SPECIFICALLY BENEFIT VETERANS: Veterans and current members of the military are expected to reap a lot of new benefits starting Oct. 1, the day that over 400 bills will become law in Maryland.

 WHEN DO WE WORRY ABOUT IMPACT OF FEDERAL JOB LOSSES IN MARYLAND? As Maryland’s workforce continues to shed federal jobs at the fastest rate in the U.S., experts still aren’t sure where the bottom is. The number of federal workers in the state declined by 2,500 in August, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Maryland is down more than 15,000 federal jobs since January — the largest decrease in the country. Economists are still not sure if the data fully captures the impact of the Trump administration’s campaign to slash the federal workforce. Greg Morton and Bria Overs/The Baltimore Banner.

 STATE HEALTH CHIEF SAYS COVID VACCINES SHOULD BE WIDELY AVAILABLE: Maryland’s health secretary this week sought to reassure state residents that protection from Covid-19 should be widely available, despite the federal government’s shifting guidance over the vaccine’s latest rollout.

 A CRAB FEAST AND A COUP AS REPUBLICAN MAYORS BACK MOORE: Pulled by tradition and strict electoral calendar observance, candidates for governor — the announced, the filed and the explorers — arrived at a patch of marina blacktop Wednesday that is home to the J. Millard Tawes Crab and Clam Bake. The annual event draws locals for a day of crabs, corn and beer and it draws the political class from far-flung corners of the state who come to crack crabs, kibitz and talk political smack. That started with Gov. Wes Moore. Bryan Sears and Christine Condon/Maryland Matters.

 * Six local Maryland Republicans — several from small towns who sometimes feel forgotten and overlooked — crossed party lines to endorse Gov. Wes Moore for reelection next year. Current Republican officials who endorsed Moore were the mayors of Lonaconing Westernport in Allegany County and Rising Sun in Cecil. The three towns have fewer than 5,000 residents each. Carson Swick/The Baltimore Sun.
* Jack Coburn, the Republican mayor of Lonaconing, said, “I’ve been the mayor here for 27 years, until 2023, we often wondered if the folks in Annapolis remembered us. But, when our water treatment system failed in January of 2023, he was here on his first days in office to ensure that the people of our community had access to clean drinking water.” Adam Thompson/WJZ-TV News.

 B’MORE COUNCIL FAILS ON PROMISE TO PROBE CHILDREN’s SCHOOL ABSENCES: The Baltimore City Council kicked off its new term in January promising to figure out why thousands of Baltimore children are frequently missing school — but nearly nine months later, a bill they almost unanimously sponsored to study the issue hasn’t been funded. Brooke Conrad/The Baltimore Sun.

 LAWSUITS AGAINST TYLENOL COULD BE IN THE OFFING: A change in the safety labels on Tylenol and other acetaminophen products could be a game changer for people claiming they weren’t properly warned about possible links between the pain reliever and autism, according to the law firm of the late Peter Angelos. Jeff Barker/The Baltimore Sun.

 SCIENCE NEGLECTED IN SOME BALTIMORE COUNTY SCHOOLS, REPORT SAYS: Science was being neglected in some Baltimore County elementary schools, a district official told the school board Wednesday. “What we found … is that unfortunately, in some areas, science was not being taught. It was not being taught to some of our most vulnerable populations,” Racquel Jones, chief of schools, said to the board in a report on the district’s test scores on the state’s standardized science test. Racquel Bazos/The Baltimore Sun.

 FREDERICK ED BOARD MULLS LIMITS ON FREE SPEECH DURING COMMENTS: To address recent concerns of profanity and disruption during the public comment period of school board meetings, the Frederick County Board of Education’s Policy Committee is contemplating how to balance free speech rights and limitations.

 MOSBY GETS WARM RECEPTION AFTER HOME DETENTION: Former Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby, in what may have been one of her first public appearances since getting off home detention, talked about the need for police reform and made her own case to an appreciative audience Wednesday in Washington. Nicole Pilsbury/Maryland Matters.

 WITH FEARS OF ICE LOOMING, MONTGOMERY CANCELS HISPANIC FESTIVAL: Montgomery County has canceled what was meant to be its second annual Hispanic Heritage Festival in Wheaton, citing concerns about community safety amid increased federal immigration enforcement. The decision, announced during Hispanic Heritage Month, has sparked criticism from some local leaders who said the move sends the wrong message. Mike Murillo/WTOP-FM.
