# Registration Now Open For The BDC’s 4th Annual Baltimore Together Summit

The Baltimore Development Corporation (BDC) has opened registration for the 2025 Baltimore Together Summit, taking place on October 27 at the M&T Bank Exchange. Now in its fourth year, the Summit gathers city leaders, business owners, community partners, and residents to celebrate Baltimore’s economic progress and to plan the next phase for the work ahead.

 Launched as part of Baltimore’s Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (CEDS), Baltimore Together focuses on building an inclusive economy by closing racial wealth gaps, investing in underserved communities, and supporting local businesses. The 2025 Progress Report and updated Implementation Matrix, to be released at the Summit, will highlight key milestones from the past year.

 “When we say Baltimore Together, we mean Baltimore thriving together,” said Mayor Brandon M. Scott. “For too long, entire communities in cities like ours were intentionally shut out of opportunity. Now we have to be just as intentional about inclusion. Every decision we make has to reflect the people of Baltimore and drive growth across all of our neighborhoods.”

 The opening day of the Summit will feature a shorter program this year with three panel discussions centered on Baltimore’s economic progress and the implementation of the city’s growth strategy. Panels will explore public-private partnership models for development, new investments, and support for local businesses, as well as insights from companies that have recently chosen to locate in Baltimore. Speakers include Affan Sheikh of Hayat Brown, MacKenzie Garvin of the Mayor’s Office of Employment Development, Eivind Dueland of Amber Infrastructure, Augie Chiasera of M&T Bank, and Mayor Brandon M. Scott.

 Throughout the week, a series of workshops will take place in neighborhoods across the city, each highlighting a key driver of Baltimore’s economy, including the power of community investment, building stronger commercial districts, the city’s growing music sector, and strategies for building strong local economies. Attendees will hear from experts, participate in interactive discussions, and help shape the next steps in Baltimore’s economic future.

 “Baltimore Together is BDC’s guiding strategy and the framework for how we grow as a city,” said Otis Rolley, president and CEO of the BDC. “That means intentionally and consistently pursuing an equity agenda in every deal, every investment, and every program. Our growth has to mirror the city we live in by ensuring that businesses and entrepreneurs reflect Baltimore’s demographics, and that the pathways to prosperity are open to everyone who calls this city home.”

 This year’s Summit is made possible through the generous support of sponsors, including Bloomberg Philanthropies, CFG Bank, M&T Bank, BGE, WNADA, Johns Hopkins University, T. Rowe Price, Continental Realty Corp., CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, and Annie E. Casey Foundation. Last year’s Summit attracted over 1,100 attendees and more than 815 livestream participants.
