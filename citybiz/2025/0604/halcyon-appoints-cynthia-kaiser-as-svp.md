# Halcyon Appoints Cynthia Kaiser As SVP

SAN DIEGO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Halcyon, the leading anti-ransomware platform provider, today announced that former FBI cybersecurity leader Cynthia Kaiser has joined the company as Senior Vice President, Ransomware Research Center. Kaiser joins Halcyon after two decades at the FBI where she built out threat intelligence sharing programs that were instrumental in disrupting major ransomware organizations, including LockBit, 8base and Qakbot. At Halcyon, Kaiser will focus on improving intel sharing with public and private entities, spearheading the effort to defeat ransomware.

 “I’m excited to join Halcyon and continue to work to defeat ransomware,” said Kaiser. “Ransomware is unlike any other threat. It’s big business; an entire ecosystem of sophisticated, motivated, unscrupulous actors who are becoming increasingly aggressive and continually deploying more advanced tools. Halcyon is the only company with the tools to detect, prevent, contain and recover from ransomware, enabling organizations to survive ransomware events without disrupting operations or paying threat actors.”

 Kaiser most recently led the FBI’s Cyber Policy, Intelligence, and Engagement Branch as a Deputy Assistant Director. In eight years with the bureau’s Cyber Division, Kaiser transformed collaboration between public and private groups into robust, proactive partnerships aimed at stopping cyber threats. Kaiser has been a member of the Cyber Safety Review Board, served as a principal for multiple critical infrastructure security groups and delivered the President’s Daily Briefing to senior White House officials in two administrations.

 “Cynthia will further strengthen Halcyon’s position as the industry-leading ransomware solution by bringing her decades of experience to help secure our advantage as the ransomware intelligence experts,” said Jon Miller, CEO & Co-founder, Halcyon.

 Kaiser will lead Halcyon’s Ransomware Research Center, where she will form partnerships with federal and state governments, industry associations, critical infrastructure groups, and threat intelligence sharing networks to aggregate best-in-class advanced ransomware information to disrupt threat actors. Kaiser will also work with government entities and elected officials on policy options that positively impact the fight against ransomware.
