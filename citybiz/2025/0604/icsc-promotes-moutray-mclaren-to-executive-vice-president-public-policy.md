# ICSC Promotes Moutray McLaren to Executive Vice President, Public Policy

NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–ICSC announced today the promotion of Moutray McLaren to the role of Executive Vice President, Public Policy. McLaren previously served as Senior Vice President, Public Policy at ICSC, and will take on the new role following the retirement of Betsy Laird.

 “Moutray has been a tireless advocate on Capitol Hill for our industry and our members during his time at ICSC, and we’re pleased to promote him to this role,” said Tom McGee, President and CEO of ICSC. “His experience in the halls of Congress and the executive branch will be instrumental to our members, and I look forward to continuing to work with Moutray to educate policymakers about the vital role our industry plays in creating vibrant, prosperous communities.”

 McLaren has extensive leadership experience and deep relationships across Capitol Hill, and has helped craft and execute ICSC’s advocacy strategy since 2022. He has worked with agenda-setting committees and members in Congress and the executive branch to drive awareness of the ICSC’s priorities on issues ranging from tax reform to Organized Retail Crime. Most recently, he has taken a leading role in ICSC’s efforts to engage in tax policy conversations in Washington.

 Prior to joining ICSC, McLaren served as Chief of Staff to United States Rep. William Timmons and in the Office of the General Counsel at the Office of Management & Budget under Director Mick Mulvaney. He began his career in public policy in Mulvaney’s congressional office. McLaren is based in Washington, D.C. and holds a B.A. from Furman University and a J.D. from Charleston School of Law.

 

“I’m honored to step into this role at such a pivotal time for our industry amid a shifting political landscape in Washington,” said McLaren. “As we navigate the ongoing tax policy debate and other legislative priorities, I am committed to advocating for policies that foster growth and stability for our members. I extend my deepest gratitude to Betsy, whose exceptional leadership and tireless dedication have set a high standard for government relations as well as service to our members.”

 In her 22 years with ICSC, Laird led ICSC’s government relations efforts during some of the most important and consequential legislative periods, including advocating for E-Fairness, tax and bankruptcy reform, COVID-19 relief, and numerous other policies in support of ICSC’s members and the Marketplaces Industry.

 “Betsy’s relationships with our members and partners on Capitol Hill have helped ICSC build a strong and highly respected presence through multiple administrations, navigating changes at both the federal and state levels,” said Tom McGee. “Her contributions are numerous, and her impact will last far beyond her tenure.”
