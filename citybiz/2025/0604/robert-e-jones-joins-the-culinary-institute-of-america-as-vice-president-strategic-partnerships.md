# Robert E. Jones Joins The Culinary Institute of America as Vice-President, Strategic Partnerships

The Culinary Institute of America today announced the appointment of CIA alum Robert E. Jones ’20 to the position of Vice-President, Strategic Partnerships, Industry Leadership, and Impact. In this newly created role, Jones will be a vital part of building out and activating elements of the college’s long-term strategic plan, strengthening its global presence, and amplifying its influence across the culinary, food, beverage, and hospitality sectors. He will also oversee the CIA’s flagship industry leadership conferences, including Menus of Change®; Healthy Kitchens, Healthy Lives; and the Worlds of Flavor International Conference and Festival.

 Jones is a well-known leader in food systems policy and thought leadership circles across the U.S., Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Previously, he served as vice president of Global Public Affairs for Mosa Meat—a Netherlands-based TIME magazine “Top 10 Startup,” and as president of Cellular Agriculture Europe, a Brussels (BE)-based industry association representing small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and multinationals, like Nestlé, in front of the European Commission and Parliament.

 “I am delighted to welcome Robert to the CIA’s leadership team,” said CIA President Michiel Bakker. “His proven track record in the fields of sustainability, health and wellbeing, and technology and innovation is ideally suited to reinforcing and augmenting the college’s nearly 80-year legacy of leadership.”

 Prior to moving to Europe, he acquired more than 20 years of high-level experience in public policy, government affairs, and partnership roles—including as an appointee in both Democratic and Republican administrations, advising the U.S. Secretary of Commerce on sustainable seafood issues. This sparked his passion for food systems change and brought him to the CIA, where he completed the Accelerated Culinary Arts Program at the CIA at Greystone in 2020.

 

“I’m truly excited to return to the CIA in this new capacity,” Jones said. “There is already a great foundation to build upon, and my past experiences have given me an understanding of the breadth of issues and challenges impacting not just our food system, but also the future of food, the hospitality workforce, and public and planetary health. There are so many opportunities ahead, and I can’t wait to dive in.”

 Jones holds a Master of Science in Social Business & Entrepreneurship from the London School of Economics, as well as a Master of Arts in Political Management from George Washington University. He has 10 years’ experience as an adjunct professor of Political Science with St. Edward’s University in Austin, Texas, and has been a formal advisor to many prominent organizations, including Food for Climate League, the Marine Fisheries Advisory Committee, European Institute of Innovation and Technology’s (EIT) Protein Diversification Think Tank, as well as an agri-food mentor for the 100x Impact Accelerator. Robert is a native of Corpus Christi, Texas, and outside of work, can be found experimenting in the kitchen, fly fishing, or on the family cattle ranch in Texas.
