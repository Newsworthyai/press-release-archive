# Joseph DeMattos Triple Latte Leadership Series Hosts Pulse Medical CEO Nino Asani

Nino Asani, Founder and CEO of Pulse Medical Transportation, is a proud son of North Macedonia, driven by an unstoppable entrepreneurial spirit. After immigrating to the United States in 1985, he began his career working in the trades as a commercial and industrial auto mechanic.

 Nino entered the medical transportation industry in 1990 and, in 2001, co-founded a medical transportation company in New Jersey. Under his leadership, the company experienced remarkable growth, expanding its fleet to 40 ambulances and 20 wheelchair-accessible vehicles and building a dedicated team of 230 employees.

 In 2008, Nino seized the opportunity to expand into Maryland, opening a branch in Owings Mills. Through strategic partnerships with LifeBridge Health and FutureCare, he launched the operation with 10 vehicles and 20 employees. Guided by his commitment to service excellence, the Maryland branch has since grown to a fleet of 32 vehicles and nearly 200 employees.

 A devoted family man, Nino Asani remains steadfast in his mission to provide compassionate, high-quality care to those in need.

 What defining moment in your career most shaped your approach to leadership?

 The defining moment came during the height of the pandemic when we were transporting vulnerable patients without a clear roadmap. I had to step up, lead with empathy, and ensure my team felt safe and supported. That crisis taught me that authentic leadership is about being present, transparent, and courageous when others need stability most.

 Beyond profit, what metric do you consider most essential to an organization’s success?

 Client trust and satisfaction. In medical transportation, our clients rely on us for timely, safe, and compassionate service. Our success is measured by their well-being and their confidence in our reliability. If patients and partners trust us, long-term success follows naturally.

 Authenticity means staying true to our mission—providing safe, reliable, and respectful service—while being open to innovation. I listen actively to my staff and clients, stay grounded in our values, and lead by example, even when changes require uncomfortable decisions.

 What strategies do you use to attract, inspire, and retain top talent?

 We focus on culture and purpose. People join us not just for a paycheck but because they want to make a difference. I invest in training, recognition, and open communication. I also ensure my team feels heard and supported—this builds loyalty and pride in our work.

 How do you align profitability with long-term value creation for all stakeholders?

 We make decisions with a long view—whether it’s maintaining high safety standards or reinvesting in better vehicles and employee development. When we prioritize quality, it leads to trust, retention, and sustainable growth. That benefits clients, employees, and the business.

 Can you share a story about a mentor who significantly influenced your leadership journey?

 A former supervisor from my early days in logistics taught me the importance of listening before leading. He emphasized the importance of patience and understanding your people—not just their roles but also their motivations. That lesson still guides how I lead today, especially when building team cohesion.

 In your view, what is the most critical leadership skill—and why?

 Emotional intelligence. In our industry, we’re dealing with human lives and emotions—sometimes in high-stress situations. Being able to read the room, stay calm, and lead with empathy makes all the difference in both service quality and team morale.
