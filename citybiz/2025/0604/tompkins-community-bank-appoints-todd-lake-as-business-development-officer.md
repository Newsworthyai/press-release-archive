# Tompkins Community Bank Appoints Todd Lake as Business Development Officer

Demonstrating its commitment to growing its business and expanding its offerings in the Hudson Valley, Tompkins Community Bank (Tompkins) has welcomed Todd Lake as its newest business development officer. Before joining Tompkins, Lake, who has worked in the financial industry for nearly two decades, oversaw the business development of Brightbox Capital. He will be responsible for generating new business, focused on Tompkins’ footprint in Dutchess County.

 “Todd has an expansive background in business development and commercial lending,” said Carol Schmitz, senior vice president and community banking division manager. “We are confident that Todd will bring a new perspective to our team and enable the growth of not only Tompkins, but of businesses throughout the Hudson Valley.”

 “Having recently moved to the Hudson Valley, I am looking forward to establishing roots in my new community,” said Lake. “Tompkins’ emphasis on giving back to the people it serves has already inspired me to get involved in the place I now call home.”

 Lake resides in Pawling, NY, with his wife and daughter.
