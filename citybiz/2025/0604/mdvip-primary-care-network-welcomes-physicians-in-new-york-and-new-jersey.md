# MDVIP Primary Care Network Welcomes Physicians in New York and New Jersey

Two respected board-certified physicians have joined MDVIP, offering membership-based primary care with same or next-day appointments, longer and more comprehensive consultations and 24/7 physician availability to patients in the New York metropolitan area.

 Monica Grover, DONew York City and Hudson Valley

 Dr. Monica Grover is a double board-certified physician in Family Medicine and Family Medicine Obstetrics & Gynecology, with a Master of Science in Clinical Nutrition. She is a dynamic, evidence-based clinician who brings a modern, whole-woman approach to care—spanning every stage of life, from the reproductive years and postpartum to perimenopause and menopause.

 Through the MDVIP Women’s Health Program, Dr. Grover delivers personalized and integrative services that include hormone balancing, postpartum care, weight management, incontinence and bladder assessments, bone health and sexual wellness. She also provides expert treatment for hemorrhoids and vein issues. Dr. Grover holds hospital privileges at NYU Langone Health, is fluent in Hindi and Punjabi, and takes pride in crafting an individualized experience for every patient she serves.

 “I believe that traditional medicine has long overlooked women’s intimate health needs, and my new practice is a forward-thinking, compassionate response that redefines what comprehensive women’s care looks like,” said Dr. Grover, whose training bridges the arts, psychology, nutrition, primary care, gynecology and medical aesthetics. “By combining advanced screenings with genuine connection, we help our patients not just manage illness, but thrive.”

 Dr. Grover has been featured in numerous print media including Vogue, Oprah Daily, New Beauty, and has appeared on “The Today Show.” To learn more about Dr. Grover or to join her practice, visit https://www.mdvip.com/doctors/monicagroverdo.

“I approach wellness and illness as the continuum of health, and my goal is to partner with patients on effectively addressing both,” said Dr. Stern. “Joining MDVIP gives me and my patients the valuable time we need to build a trusting relationship, dive into their medical histories and together develop a plan that can help ward off disease and improve quality of life on their journey to optimal health.”

 More Time with the Doctor

 As MDVIP affiliates, Dr. Grover and Dr. Stern maintain smaller practices, allowing them to spend more time with each patient and provide conveniences including same- or next-day appointments and the ability to reach the doctor 24/7 by phone.

 Comprehensive Wellness Program

 For the annual membership fee, patients receive a comprehensive yearly health assessment that includes advanced diagnostic tests and screenings to give a more complete view of their overall health. Using the results, the doctors provide personalized coaching and tools to help patients make healthier lifestyle choices, prevent disease and achieve their wellness goals.

 Proven Health Outcomes

 Studies published in peer-reviewed medical journals show that patients in MDVIP-affiliated practices experience fewer hospitalizations and readmissions, visit urgent care centers and emergency rooms less often, receive more preventive health services and have better control of chronic diseases than patients in traditional practices. MDVIP’s patient satisfaction scores and annual membership renewals consistently exceed 90%.
