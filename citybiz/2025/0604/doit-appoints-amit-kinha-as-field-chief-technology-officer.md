# DoiT Appoints Amit Kinha as Field Chief Technology Officer

SANTA CLARA, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–DoiT, a global leader in enterprise-grade FinOps and cloud financial management, today announced the appointment of Amit Kinha as field chief technology officer (Field CTO). In this role, Kinha will guide the DoiT Cloud Intelligence vision, roadmap and champion FinOps best practices across the industry. His leadership will ensure that FinOps practitioners and business leaders alike have the actionable insights they need to extract maximum value from every cloud workload.

 Kinha joins from Citigroup, where he was director of cloud FinOps, leading product and engineering efforts to build in-house FinOps tooling, optimize multi-cloud spend and shape the company’s broader cloud strategy. Prior to Citigroup, he spent seven years at Goldman Sachs as a software engineer, where he helped deliver flagship projects, including the Apple Card and Marcus.

 “Amit possesses formidable FinOps experience, along with a vision that anticipates and ushers in the future of cloud platforms,” said Vadim Solovey, chief executive officer at DoiT. “This is the type of world-class talent and expertise driving our technology development. As we move forward, we’re confident Amit’s leadership will ensure DoiT remains out front in bringing the most effective FinOps tools to market.”

 An active force in the global FinOps community, Kinha has spoken at FinOps Foundation events, including the NYC Roadshow and FinOps X. He also serves as a FinOps Ambassador and contributes to the evolution of the FinOps FOCUS standard as a member of its Steering Committee.

 “FinOps isn’t just about cost anymore—it’s about control, speed and unlocking smarter decisions at scale,” said Kinha. “DoiT is rewriting the rules of what’s possible in cloud financial management. I’m excited to help shape a platform that doesn’t just react to cloud spend—it predicts, governs and elevates cloud strategy into a business advantage.”

 The DoiT Cloud Intelligence platform was built from the ground up to address the complexities and demands of the Cloud+ era—where mere cost visibility and analytics for cloud spend alone are no longer sufficient, and true efficiency requires understanding the intent and resource behind any workload, managing its risks and enabling action at scale. The DoiT platform enables FinOps-focused organizations to thrive in the Cloud+ era. It is also certified by the FinOps Foundation, the highest recognition offered by the organization.
