DENVER–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Zayo, a leading global communications infrastructure provider, today announced Alan Heckler has been named Chief Innovation & Integration Officer. With more than 25 years of combined industry and consulting experience, Heckler brings a deep background in digital infrastructure, industrial transformation, and M&A strategy. In this role, Heckler will lead integration efforts, including Zayo’s recent acquisition of Crown Castle’s fiber solutions business, in addition to transformation initiatives focused on accelerating long-term growth for Zayo’s business.

 “Our recent acquisition of Crown Castle demonstrates Zayo’s commitment to delivering the critical infrastructure our customers need to usher in the next generation of technology.
