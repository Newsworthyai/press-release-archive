# Repertoire Immune Medicines Appoints Robert Andtbacka, MD, CM, FACS, FRCSC, as Chief Medical Officer

Repertoire Immune Medicines, a biotechnology company pioneering the discovery and development of programmable T cell-targeted immune medicines, today announced the appointment of Robert Andtbacka, MD, CM, FACS, FRCSC, as Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Andtbacka brings over two decades of clinical, strategic, and operational leadership in oncology drug development.

 “We are thrilled to welcome Robert to Repertoire’s leadership team at this pivotal stage in our evolution,” said Torben Straight Nissen, Chairman and CEO of Repertoire and Executive Partner at Flagship Pioneering. “His extensive experience in advancing novel therapies through clinical development will be invaluable as we transition to a clinical-stage company. RPTR-1-201, our lead development candidate, is progressing through IND-enabling studies, and following recent positive interactions with regulatory authorities, we plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in multiple cancer indications. Robert’s strategic and clinical expertise will be instrumental as we advance on our mission to deliver transformative T cell-targeted therapies to patients.”

 RPTR-1-201 will be Repertoire’s first T-cell receptor (TCR) bispecific development candidate to enter clinical development. By targeting a novel peptide selectively presented on multiple solid tumors, RPTR-1-201 has the potential to treat a broad range of cancers. RPTR-1-201 was discovered and optimized using Repertoire’s proprietary DECODE platform.

 “I’m honored to join Repertoire at such an exciting time in its journey,” said Dr. Andtbacka. “I’m particularly inspired by Repertoire’s bold vision to harness the immune system with precision. I look forward to working with this exceptional team to advance groundbreaking T cell-targeted therapies for patients with limited treatment options.”

 

“Repertoire has developed a unique discovery platform and, with our deep expertise in T cell biology, we have built an exciting pipeline of T cell-based immune medicines” said Dr. Anthony Coyle, President and Head of Research and Development. “With Robert joining the organization, we are well positioned to advance these molecules from research to clinical development.”

 Dr. Andtbacka is an internationally recognized clinical expert and seasoned biopharma executive with more than 20 years of experience spanning therapeutic research and development, academic leadership, and company-building. Most recently, he served as Chief Medical Officer at HiFiBiO Therapeutics, overseeing clinical and strategic development of the company’s immuno-oncology and autoimmune disease pipelines. Prior to that, he served as the Chief Medical Officer of Seven and Eight Biopharmaceuticals, where he led the development of novel immunotherapies, oncolytic viruses, and antibody drug conjugates, and played a key role in the acquisition of clinical assets by Eikon Therapeutics.
