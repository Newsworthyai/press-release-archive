# Q&amp;A with Sebastien Lagree, Founder and CEO of Lagree Fitness

Sebastien Lagree is the founder and CEO of Lagree Fitness, a pioneering fitness company known for its patented, high-intensity, low-impact workout method practiced in over 500 licensed studios worldwide. A former bodybuilder turned inventor, Lagree has redefined strength training by merging biomechanics with cutting-edge engineering. He holds more than 100 patents, including those for his signature machines like the Megaformer, Mini Pro, and Supraformer, all designed to maximize muscular engagement while minimizing joint strain.

 Beyond building a workout, Lagree has created a vertically integrated ecosystem, manufacturing his own equipment, certifying trainers, and licensing the method globally, all without a traditional franchise model. His vision for the future of fitness includes machine electrification, AI integration, and a mind-body interface, placing Lagree Fitness at the forefront of wellness innovation.

 Tell us a little bit about your background and what led you to create The Lagree Method.

 My background is bodybuilding. I started to teach Pilates in July 1998. I noticed that the Pilates clientele didn’t feel like Pilates was intense.

 I created a circuit training program using Pilates equipment and bodybuilding training techniques. I have been working on the method ever since.

 The method went through 8 revisions. I only started to reference the revisions recently, so right now we are transitioning to Lagree 2.0 (which really should be Lagree 8.0)

 For those who may not be familiar, what is The Lagree Method, and how does it stand apart from other fitness modalities on the market?

 Lagree is unique in the sense that the method is only 40% complete. It’s a workout designed to integrate all the essential components for Physical & Mental health. We used tried and proven training techniques and exercises mixed with some of our own training techniques and exercises. In a nutshell, Lagree is a low impact High Intensity Core Muscular Strength and Endurance workout for the modern day man and woman.

 Lagree has grown into a globally recognized brand. To what do you attribute the method’s growth and long-term success?

 Innovation, what sets us apart are the constant innovations. I currently have 200 patents. I am relentless. I am currently working on 12 new models.

 My philosophy is rooted in progressive overloading. I have to design a machine that allows people to keep progressing. Hence the evolution.

 

How does The Lagree Method continue to differentiate itself from competitors, especially in an industry where knockoff concepts and mislabeling are increasingly common?

 We don’t see true competition, what we see is, copytition, a term I coined and trademarked. There’s a clear distinction between authentic innovation and imitation. While competitors push the method forward, copycats simply replicate without understanding the science or integrity behind the Lagree Method. They dilute the market, confuse consumers, and ultimately do more harm than good. We actively protect our intellectual property and are committed to maintaining the highest standard for the Lagree brand worldwide.

 What has been your greatest achievement as the founder of Lagree? Is there a particular milestone or moment that stands out to you?

 None so far. Every year, I outdo myself; it’s part of Lagree’s DNA to evolve and improve but I wouldn’t call that an accomplishment.

 I guess the greatest accomplishment will be the full electrification of the machine.

 How do you stay motivated, and how do you inspire innovation and passion across your studios and the broader Lagree community?

 Motivation comes from within. It’s very important to keep doing the things that motivate me like working out. I love to workout.

 I also love to create. It’s very important for me to always work on the next machines.

 I need to look forward to something. I am playing the long game so you can expect amazing machines to come for the next 50 years.

 What’s next for The Lagree Method and Lagree Fitness in 2025 and beyond?

 That is my favorite question: The future.

 I live in the future.

 You can expect amazing machines with never seen before features and functionailty.

 I can’t talk too much about our R&D but if you check our patent portfolio you will see patents for

 * Brain/machine connection
* Magnetic levitation
* Holographic display
* To name a few
