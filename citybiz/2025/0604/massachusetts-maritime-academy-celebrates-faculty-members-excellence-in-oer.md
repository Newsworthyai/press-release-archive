# Massachusetts Maritime Academy Celebrates Faculty Member’s Excellence in OER

Massachusetts Maritime Academy, a top-ranked public university with undergraduate degree programs focusing on science, engineering, technology, math, and business that blend academics and experiential learning, is pleased to celebrate the award-winning work of its esteemed International Maritime Business (IMB) faculty member, Dr. Paul Szwed, for developing cutting edge, scholarly Open Educational Resources (OER) for his IMB courses.

 On Monday, May 19, 2025, the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education’s (DHE’s) OER Advisory Council hosted its annual Faculty OER Awards ceremony at Quinsigamond Community College. These awards recognize outstanding faculty achievements in OER development, adoption and use in public higher education courses. MMA Library Director Carolyn Michaud attended and accepted the 2025 Silver Faculty OER Award on behalf of Dr. Szwed, and later presented him with the award at MMA. Dr. Szwed was honored with a certificate and a $750 honorarium for his dedication to making higher education open resources available to both MMA students and students across the globe via online access. By definition, all OER are “freely accessible text, media, and other digital assets” according to Massachusetts Department of Higher Education. Dr. Szwed has created open e-modules and ancillary course resources for his Project Management Fundamentals and Supply Chain Management courses, as well as an open workbook for Project Management Fundamentals.

 “OER are central to the library’s mission of providing accessible, scholarly information resources to our students; they also promote the Academy’s goals of supporting faculty and student curricula needs,” said Michaud. “Dr. Szwed’s OER save each of his students hundreds of dollars in textbook costs per semester. That helps students who might otherwise elect to go without textbooks, and empowers students in these areas of business study throughout Massachusetts and the nation.”

 “Dr. Szwed’s efforts embody the spirit of learning, and of sharing knowledge for the betterment of everyone,” added the Academy’s Dean of Undergraduate Studies, James McKenna, Ph.D. “We are very proud of Paul, and celebrate this recognition with him.”

 Students can access these resources at the Open Massachusetts repository. Interested staff, faculty, and students should contact library@maritime.edu for more information.
