# Love That Lasts: La Posada Residents Celebrated 75 Years of Marriage

Love really can last forever—and residents of La Posada, a Kisco Senior Living community, proved just that. On September 10, La Posada honored residents Tony and Marie Maltese as they celebrated their remarkable 75th wedding anniversary.

 Their story began in 1949 at a bungalow in Bradley Beach, New Jersey. Tony, recently home from serving in World War II, was outside washing his car when he caught the attention of 17-year-old Marie, a friend of his sister’s. What Tony didn’t know was that, while he was overseas, Marie had often visited his family home. There, she noticed a framed photo of the young soldier on the mantel and felt certain he was the one she was meant to marry. Meeting him in person only confirmed what her heart already knew.

 Before long, Tony asked her out, and on their very first date they shared a dance—an elegant beginning to what would become a lifelong passion for ballroom dancing and the rhythm of a love story that has lasted 75 years.

That moment shaped our lives together. For 75 years, the joy we found in dancing has carried us through every season, giving us laughter, comfort, and countless memories. It’s incredible how quickly the years have flown by, and we’re so grateful to have shared this journey side by side.”

 The Maltese family marked the occasion with a series of celebrations, including a private family dinner hosted by La Posada and a traditional clam bake where relatives traveled from Tennessee and beyond.

 Research has shown that lifelong companionship has powerful benefits for health and well-being. Studies suggest that strong, supportive relationships can contribute to longer life expectancy, reduced stress, and improved overall quality of life. Tony and Marie’s love story is a testament to how partnership and joy can help sustain vitality throughout the aging process.

 

 “Tony and Marie are an inspiration—not only to our residents but to everyone who meets them,” said Rick Minichino, Life Enrichment Director at La Posada. “Their love story is a living example of devotion, joy, and resilience, and it reflects the sense of community we strive to create here every day. At La Posada, we celebrate life at every stage, and Tony and Marie remind us that love has no age limit and that true partnership makes every year richer.”

 At La Posada, couples like the Malteses are able to continue nurturing their relationships while enjoying the community’s support, amenities, and vibrant lifestyle. For Tony and Marie, the friendships they’ve built and the opportunities to share their story with others made reaching this milestone all the more special. They were overjoyed to celebrate their 75th anniversary surrounded by family, friends, and fellow residents, and to share the secrets that have kept their love strong for decades.

 “Flexibility, compromise, and not sweating the small stuff have always been our guiding principles,” said the Malteses. “Most importantly, we learned early how to say, ‘Yes, dear.’ Over 75 years, those lessons have helped us navigate life’s challenges, celebrate the joys, and build a love that continues to grow stronger every day. Every memory has been a gift, and we hope our story can inspire others to cherish and nurture their relationships for the long haul.”
