# Local Family Opens Leading Dog Daycare in Norfolk

Dogtopia, the nation’s leading dog wellness franchise, is opening a new location in Norfolk on September 22. Located at 118 W 21st St, Dogtopia of Norfolk-Ghent will provide award-winning dog daycare, boarding and spa services to dog parents in the community. The 7,500-square-foot facility will also feature a full Earthwise pet nutrition store, offering high-quality pet foods and wellness products. As a welcome gift, new customers can enjoy limited-time promotions, including $79/week unlimited daycare for a full year and bonus days with two- or three-day weekly plans.

 Providing personalized care for Norfolk-Ghent pups in a fun, enriching, and safe environment, Dogtopia sets the industry standard among dog daycares with its focus on three key benefits: socialization, exercise, and education. Dogtopia allows dogs to enjoy plenty of exercise, play with like-minded dogs, and learn important social skills, all under the supervision of professionally trained Canine Coaches. In keeping safety at the forefront, each of the indoor and climate-controlled playrooms includes dogs of similar size and play style and is built with compressed rubber flooring to reduce the impact on dogs’ paws and joints.

 Meet The Local Owners:

 The Norfolk-Ghent location is owned and operated by the Sutelan family: Chip Sutelan, Barbara Sutelan, Rachel Sutelan, Edward Sutelan, and Mary Pyle. Donovan Martini, Rachel’s fiancé, will also be helping manage the daycare. The Sutelan family, longtime dog lovers with diverse professional backgrounds, were inspired to bring Dogtopia to Norfolk-Ghent after discovering the brand through a radio ad. Their experience spans entrepreneurship, education, and business management, and they are excited to combine their skills with their passion for dogs to create a welcoming and engaging environment for the community. As part of that commitment, the family will be hosting a grand opening event in October to celebrate with local pet parents and their pups.

 “We’ve always loved dogs, and we’re thrilled to bring Dogtopia’s safe, fun, and engaging environment to Norfolk-Ghent,” said Chip Sutelan. “Our goal is to provide exceptional care for dogs while creating a welcoming community for their owners. We’re also excited to offer the Earthwise store here, giving pet parents access to premium nutrition and wellness products in the same convenient location.”

 Dogtopia also runs the Dogtopia Foundation, a nonprofit with the mission to enable dogs to positively change our world. The Foundation funds programs focused on three worthy causes: service dogs for veterans, therapy dogs for students, and employment initiatives for adults with autism. One hundred percent of funds raised are donated directly to the supported organizations. To learn more, visit www.dogtopiafoundation.org.
