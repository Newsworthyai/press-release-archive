# Interior Logic Group Appoints Alan Davenport as Chief Executive Officer and Jeff Trapp as Chief Commercial Officer

Interior Logic Group (“ILG” or the “Company”), a leading provider of interior design and finish solutions for the building industry, today announced that Alan Davenport is returning to lead ILG as Chief Executive Officer, effective October 6, 2025. Davenport previously spent more than a decade with ILG, including eight years as CEO. He succeeds Jon Weldon, who has served as Interim CEO since June. Weldon will transition to a senior operations role, reporting to Davenport.

 Under Davenport’s prior leadership, ILG grew from $300 million to $2 billion in revenue through an intense focus on service, technology and homebuilder relationships. He rejoins ILG with the same commitment to excellence, service and being the partner-of-choice for homebuilders across the country. Recognized for his deep industry knowledge and relationships and his inspiring leadership, Davenport’s return marks a meaningful reconnection to the foundational strengths that contributed to ILG’s early successes.

 “I am honored to rejoin ILG to lead this talented and passionate team as we strengthen our industry relationships and look to establish the Company as the go-to partner for interior design and finish solutions in the next era of personalized home improvement,” said Mr. Davenport. “I can’t wait to roll my sleeves back up alongside my dedicated colleagues to reconnect with customers, identify innovation opportunities and continue delivering on bringing homebuilders’ visions to life.”

 ILG today also announced that alongside Davenport, Jeff Trapp, who previously spent 17 years at the Company, is returning as Chief Commercial Officer, effective immediately.

 “We are thrilled to welcome Alan and Jeff back to ILG and believe their return reflects a strong vote of confidence in the future of the Company,” said Board Chair Dinesh Lathi. “Their longstanding knowledge of the business and the home building industry is unmatched, and we are confident that their leadership will position ILG to build on its momentum and deliver innovative, high-quality, stylish and exceptionally valued home solutions tailored for today’s market.”

 “I could not be more excited to return to ILG, where I spent much of my career partnering with a diverse range of single family, multifamily, commercial, and repair and remodel customers. ILG’s forward-thinking approach is rooted in customer satisfaction, and that focus will only continue to set this Company apart in an increasingly competitive and personalized world,” shared Mr. Trapp.

 Lathi continued, “We also want to thank Jon Weldon for his tremendous leadership during this transition period. We look forward to continuing to benefit from his experience as a key operational leader, alongside Alan and Jeff.”
