# Lucid Design District Announces Artists Selected for CHROMA 2025 During Miami Art Week

Lucid Design District announces the 22 artists selected for CHROMA 2025 – Vital Impulses in Contemporary Art, running from December 3–17, 2025.

 Vanessa Gilbert (Canada) “Taking part in the CHROMA exhibition at Lucid Gallery, located in the heart of the Design District during Art Basel Miami, is truly a dream come true. Last year, I was there as an admirer — and this year, I return as an exhibiting artist. What an incredible journey!” Gilbert’s minimalist sculptures, made with recycled and sustainable materials, merge human imagination with natural forms. Her practice invites reflection on consumption, renewal, and the role of art in shaping a more conscious future.

This opportunity allows me to share my latest work with a wider audience and contribute to a vibrant dialogue around creativity, resilience, and artistic expression.”

 Sebastian de la Paz (Ecuador/Miami) A pop artist originally from Quito, now based in Miami, de la Paz contributes his Echoes of Expression series to CHROMA 2025. Inspired by Warhol and Lichtenstein, these bold canvases transform familiar hand gestures into striking visual statements. By blending street art immediacy with pop iconography, his work interrogates how communication evolves in an increasingly digital age.

 Together, these artists highlight how resilience, sustainability, and visual language converge under the curatorial theme of Vital Impulses.

 About Lucid Design District

 Founded by Payal Tak in 2021 and located at 10 NE 41st Street, Lucid Design District debuted as a gallery during Art Basel 2022. The space has since become a cornerstone of the Miami Design District’s art scene. Featuring 8 solo-curio spaces, an expansive reception gallery, and an outdoor installation wall, Lucid is dedicated to showcasing bold voices across all career stages. CHROMA continues to be its flagship exhibition during Miami Art Week.

 “After retiring from a high intensity career in technology five years ago I traded corporate America for an art gallery,” comments Payal Tak. “My mission was simple – to make available an easily accessible wall space for artists in a prime location. CHROMA continues to attract thousands of visitors during Art Week and Lucid continues to showcase the artists’ creations well into the following year, making it a very desirable platform for the artists to participate in and for art lovers to discover the undiscovered.”
