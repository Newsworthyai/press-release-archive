# Local Travel Enthusiasts Open Idaho’s First Expedia Cruises in Boise

Travel planning just got a lot easier in the Treasure Valley with the arrival of the first Expedia Cruises location in the state of Idaho. Located in Boise at 13601 W McMillan Rd. Unit A104, the new franchise will host a tailgate-themed Grand Opening celebration on Saturday, September 27, where the entire community is invited to join the fun.

 As a full-service leisure travel agency franchise backed by one of the most powerful travel brands in the world, Boise community members now have a go-to resource for all their travel needs.

 The Boise location is owned and operated by Mike and LesliAnn Hansen, local travel lovers who bring a lifetime of global experience and strong community ties to the business. The couple spent several years living and traveling abroad with their three children before returning to the United States a decade ago. When Mike’s job led them back to Boise last year, they saw the perfect opportunity to turn their shared passion for travel into something more.

 The Hansens were drawn to the brand’s trusted name and hybrid model that allows travelers to book online or work directly with expert Vacation Consultants. Eager to reconnect with the Boise community, they decided to launch Idaho’s first Expedia Cruises location.

 “Opening the first Expedia Cruises in Idaho has been an incredible experience,” said LesliAnn. “Travel has always played an integral role in our lives, and we are looking forward to helping other Idaho residents create unforgettable memories. Being able to do this in a city we’ve loved for so many years makes it even more special.”

 Currently, the Boise team includes 13 highly trained Vacation Consultants, with plans to expand. The most popular destination for their clients is Alaska, followed closely by Europe and the Caribbean.

 Expedia Cruises – part of the Expedia Group family of brands – offers air, land, and sea vacations through its 260+ locations across North America. Customers can choose from numerous vacation possibilities including luxury and expedition travel, river cruises, land tours, safaris, all-inclusive resort properties, and insurance – all at Expedia prices with no additional fees. In addition to the research and booking features available on their local website, the Hansen’s and their team offer personal vacation consultations in-person, through email, or over the phone, so customers always have the freedom to book when, where, and how they choose!
