 The Goldie B. Wolfe Miller Women Leaders in Real Estate Initiative, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preparing women to advance as leaders in commercial real estate by providing financial and professional support, recently announced scholarship winners for the upcoming school year. Since 2007, The Goldie Initiative has created a professional community of women with extraordinary academic and leadership potential, known as Goldie Scholars.

 With a unique strategy of scholarship, mentoring, networking and leadership skills development, The Goldie Initiative cultivates talented women into future leaders. The program supports women pursuing graduate-level studies in business, law, design, or management, with a focus on real estate.

Given your leadership role as President of The Goldie Initiative Board of Directors, why should Commercial Real Estate professionals attend the 9th Annual Goldie Gala on September 18, 2025? What is so special about the event?

 The Goldie Gala brings together top leaders, rising stars, and influential voices across the CRE landscape. It’s a one-of-a-kind opportunity to network with industry changemakers while directly supporting the next generation of women leaders. The Gala is more than a spectacular celebration; it’s a catalyst for change. Every dollar raised supports high-potential women pursuing careers in commercial real estate, helping to shape a more inclusive and innovative future for our field. By attending, you’re not only investing in meaningful connections – but you’re also investing in the future of commercial real estate itself.

 As a professional with a long track record in the CRE industry, can you tell me about how TGI is making a positive impact on the CRE industry?

 With an 18-year legacy and over 200 alumnae, The Goldie Initiative has demonstrated both resilience and relevance. Former Goldie Scholars are now thriving in leadership, innovation, and community-building roles across the industry — contributing not only to the success of their organizations but to the overall advancement of the CRE sector.

 What sets The Goldie Initiative apart is its strategic, multifaceted approach: combining scholarships, mentoring, networking, and professional development. This comprehensive model continues to cultivate a pipeline of highly qualified women who are well-prepared to become the next generation of CRE leaders.

 Beyond programming, The Goldie Initiative has built a strong stakeholder community — one that includes generous sponsors who not only provide financial support but also play an active role in advancing our mission.

 The results speak for themselves: investing in the growth of women leaders enhances organizational performance and drives diversity at the highest levels of management. At the same time, The Goldie Initiative creates a powerful platform for senior executives to give back — mentoring and championing rising talent in meaningful, lasting ways.

 How can companies, organizations and individuals support and get more involved with The Goldie Initiative. How might companies interested in supporting women gain access to this impressive pool of female leaders in the CRE industry?

 We are incredibly fortunate to have a vibrant network of committed, generous volunteers and supporters from across the commercial real estate community. This year alone, over 200 sponsors have contributed to help us nearly reach our ambitious $1.2 million fundraising goal — a testament to the industry’s growing commitment to advancing women in leadership.

 The most impactful way to support The Goldie Initiative right now is by donating and attending our signature event: the Goldie Gala, taking place on September 18, 2025, at Union Station in Chicago. The Gala is not only a celebration of our mission — it’s also the most engaging and inspiring way to connect with our community, meet our scholars and alumnae, and witness firsthand the difference we’re making in the CRE industry.

 Each year at the Gala, we honor excellence in leadership through our Shero Award, which celebrates senior women in CRE who exemplify success and mentorship. This year, we are thrilled to recognize Kim Adams of Clarion Partners as our 2025 Shero. We’ll also proudly introduce our largest-ever cohort of 40 Goldie Scholars, and welcome back to our inaugural class from 2007 — a full-circle moment that shows the lasting impact of our work.

 It’s truly a night that celebrates the best of CRE — past, present, and future — and you’re invited!

 How does mentoring help women reach the C-Suite in CRE and what are the organization’s strategies related to mentoring Goldie Scholars?

 Mentorship is a powerful catalyst for career advancement — particularly for women aspiring to reach the C-suite in commercial real estate. It accelerates professional development, enhances confidence, and offers critical insights that aren’t always taught in the classroom. Just as importantly, it creates rewarding, lasting relationships for both the mentor and the mentee.

 At The Goldie Initiative, mentorship is one of the four cornerstones of our Scholar Program. Each Goldie Scholar is thoughtfully paired with a senior real estate professional in her area of interest. These mentors are carefully selected for their leadership, expertise, and ability to serve as strong role models. The resulting relationships offer scholars hands-on, real-world exposure that complement their graduate education — preparing them to lead, innovate, and thrive in the industry.

 To ensure excellence in our mentoring program, The Goldie Initiative has partnered with the Center for Mentoring Excellence, a nationally respected organization that helps us apply best practices to every aspect of the mentorship experience. As we continue to expand — including into the Northeast U.S. — we remain committed to delivering high-value mentoring relationships that drive results and inspire long-term success.

 As you finish your tenure as President of Board of The Goldie Initiative, what accomplishments are you most proud of and what do you want your leadership legacy to be?

 As I finish my tenure as President of the Board of The Goldie Initiative, I’m most proud of the strides we’ve made in expanding our impact, strengthening our network, and deepening our commitment to developing the next generation of women leaders in commercial real estate. We’ve grown not only in the number of Scholars we support but also geographically through our expansion to the Northeast. We’ve enhanced our partnerships with leading CRE firms and elevated the visibility of The Goldie Initiative across the industry.

 What I want my leadership legacy to be is this: that I helped position The Goldie Initiative for sustainable, long-term growth and impact. I hope to be remembered as a connector—someone who helped bring the right people together to champion the mission and move it forward. And most of all, I hope I’ve played a role in empowering women to step confidently into leadership roles and reshape the commercial real estate industry for the better.
