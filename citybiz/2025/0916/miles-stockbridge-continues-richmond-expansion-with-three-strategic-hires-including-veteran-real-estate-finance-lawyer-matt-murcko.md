Miles & Stockbridge, an Am Law 200 firm with more than 200 lawyers and offices in Maryland, Washington, D.C., Virginia and New York, is pleased to announce that veteran commercial real estate finance lawyer Matt Murcko joined the firm’s Richmond office today as a principal. Emily Bittner and Phoebe Brannock also have joined as counsel and associate to support growth in the firm’s real estate and environmental practices, reflecting a continuing commitment to meeting client needs in the growing Richmond market.

 The three lawyers’ arrival comes one month after construction lawyer Andy Mathews joined the Richmond office. Murcko also reunites with former colleague and finance lawyer Chris Vinyard, who joined as a principal in April.

 “We’re thrilled to welcome Matt, Emily and Phoebe to our team,” said John Badman IV, managing principal of the Richmond office. “Matt brings more than three decades of commercial real estate finance experience, further enhancing the legal services we provide to clients across Virginia and beyond. At the same time, adding Emily and Phoebe brings valuable and diverse real estate and environmental experience, further strengthening our team’s capabilities.”

 Murcko regularly assists lenders on construction and term loans, working capital loans and floor plan lines of credit for automobile dealership facilities nationwide. He has 30 years of experience handling various types of credit transactions, including secured and unsecured commercial credit facilities, real estate construction and permanent financing, workouts and restructurings, among other matters. He was previously a partner at Troutman Pepper Locke’s Richmond office.

 “Miles & Stockbridge provides the perfect platform to serve my clients, who also will benefit from the resources and services available at the firm,” said Murcko. “I’m excited to be part of this strong real estate finance team and help the firm extend its presence in Richmond and other parts of Virginia.”

 Bittner advises clients on environmental regulatory issues, real estate transactions and development projects. She previously worked in the county attorney’s office for one of the largest jurisdictions in Virginia, where she oversaw environmental matters.

 Brannock assists clients with a variety of real estate matters, including transactions, zoning and land use, as well as environmental issues. She joins Miles & Stockbridge from Gentry Locke.
