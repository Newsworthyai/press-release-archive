# Cvent Named ‘Best Event Platform’ in 2025 Digiday Technology Awards

Cvent, a market-leading meetings, events and hospitality technology provider, has been named the winner in the Best Event Platform category in this year’s Digiday Technology Awards. This recognition highlights the Company’s role in advancing marketing performance through its innovative event marketing and management platform. Cvent’s robust AI-driven attendee engagement tools, analytics solutions and deep industry intelligence enable marketing teams to derive greater value from their event programs.

 The Digiday Technology Awards, a prestigious endorsement in the marketing technology space, celebrate innovative technology companies using AI and automation to deliver more personalized experiences, precise targeting, and measurable marketing performance across channels. This year, Cvent joined global brands including The Walt Disney Company, Grammarly, and Intuit Mailchimp as winners of these coveted awards. The expansion of this year’s awards program to include the ‘Best Event Platform’ category underscores the growing importance of event technology to modern marketing tech stacks.

 As organizations continue to prioritize face-to-face experiences to connect with their target audiences, they increasingly rely on technology platforms and integrated systems that elevate attendee engagement, enable smarter targeting to improve event ROI and advance marketing goals. In an era where marketing excellence is directly tied to the data, insights, and actions gleaned from each meeting or event, this accolade reflects Cvent’s best-in-class approach to bringing event and marketing technology together to drive measurable results.

 Cvent’s nomination was anchored in a compelling case study featuring work with the University of Southern California (USC) that illustrates how strategic event technology can foster global engagement and measurable outcomes.

 “We’re honored to be recognized as the ‘Best Event Platform’ by Digiday for our work with USC as we help organizations embrace the shift toward data-driven, AI-powered event-led-growth strategies that prioritize impact over impression,” said Kate Hammitt, Vice President of Marketing at Cvent. “USC’s ability to connect with students globally, through personalized engagement and seamless experiences, demonstrates Cvent’s commitment to empowering marketers with innovative solutions in a rapidly changing landscape. For today’s marketers, these results underscore the strategic value of live events as a channel for building community, enhancing ROI, and delivering tailored experiences at scale.”
