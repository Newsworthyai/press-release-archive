# Humana and Conviva Volunteers Pack Meals to Fight Hunger in South Florida

Humana and Conviva Senior Primary Care joined forces with Feeding South Florida and U.S. Hunger Thursday, Sept. 4, 2025, for a powerful day of service aimed at addressing food insecurity in South Florida.

 As part of Humana’s annual Community Day, hundreds of volunteers across the region dedicated their time to helping local families and seniors gain easier access to nutritious meals.

 At Feeding South Florida’s Pembroke Park warehouse, Humana volunteers sorted and packaged thousands of pounds of food for distribution to food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and community partners across the region.

 Together, Humana, Conviva, and their partners are helping to break the cycle of hunger through hands-on service, demonstrating their shared commitment to improving the health and well-being of the communities they serve.
