# K9 Resorts to Debut in the Big Apple; Expands NY Presence with Seasoned Hospitality Group

Continuing to build on a year of positive franchise development, K9 Resorts Luxury Pet Hotel is now expanding on the East Coast with its first location in New York City. The multi award-winning and internationally recognized pet boarding and daycare brand has partnered with a seasoned hospitality group, The Dhillon Group, to open a location in Brooklyn at 295 Front Street in the Dumbo neighborhood in early 2026. A significant milestone for the brand, K9 Resorts will soon serve New York dog owners who are known to prioritize pet care services such as boarding and daycare.

 Having already seen much success as area hotel operators, The Dhillon Group decided to invest in a growing sector of the hospitality industry: pet care. The continued success of K9 Resorts and quality of its services and facilities cemented The Dhillon Group’s interest in bringing the brand to the global business hub that is New York City. Having signed on for 10 total locations, the group’s Brooklyn resort will serve as K9’s first urban location. Led by Harry Sandhu, the resort will aim to be New York dogs’ home away from home and one of the only area facilities with an outdoor area for play.

 “K9 Resorts has built a reputation as the premier luxury brand in pet hospitality, and we believe it is uniquely positioned to thrive in New York City,” said Harry Sandhu. “This is a city where excellence is expected, and K9’s dedication to quality and service makes it a perfect fit. We’re confident that Brooklyn families will quickly embrace K9 Resorts as the trusted destination for their pets.”

 According to a survey conducted by Talker, 40% of dog owners surveyed worry about their dog’s needs more than their own, with 34% expressing concern their dogs won’t get the love they deserve when they aren’t around. In a city with millions of dogs, K9 Resorts is primed to be a trusted place for New Yorkers to take their pets for boarding and daycare.

 “Partnering with the Dhillon Group comes at a pivotal time for our brand as we enter the vibrant Brooklyn market,” said Jason Parker, Co-Founder and CEO of K9 Resorts. “K9 Resorts has always been committed to providing best-in-class care through quality assurance and individualized attention, and the Dhillon Group’s passion for creating luxury hospitality experiences for both staff and clients aligns perfectly with our mission.”

 With pet ownership continuing to increase and over 64 million U.S. households now owning a dog, the demand for pet services is greater than ever. K9 Resorts is meeting that demand with the unmatched quality of its services and facilities, and is poised to further dominate the sector as an industry leader.

 K9 Resorts is actively seeking single and multi-unit owners to bring luxury pet boarding and daycare to their community. To learn more about the K9 Resorts franchise opportunity, visit www.k9franchise.com. To learn more about K9 Resorts Luxury Pet Hotels, visit www.k9resorts.com.
