# Gabriel Hasson Joins ICR as Global Head of Governance &amp; Shareholder Advisory

ICR, a leading strategic communications and advisory firm, today announced the appointment of Gabriel Hasson as Global Head of Governance & Shareholder Advisory. In this role, he will lead the firm’s team advising company management and Boards of Directors across the full spectrum of strategic governance matters, including investment fund stewardship engagement, ESG and bylaw policy strategy and disclosure, shareholder activism, and proxy contest advisory.

 Hasson joins ICR’s New York office from BlackRock’s Investment Stewardship team, where he served as Director for six years, managing a portfolio exceeding $400B across the U.S., Canada, and Latin America. His oversight spanned the pharmaceuticals, healthcare, life sciences, and consumer sectors, and he notably built and led BlackRock’s stewardship strategy, establishing the firm’s governance footprint across seven Latin American countries. During his tenure, he engaged extensively with Boards and C-suite leaders, emerging as a recognized thought leader in governance, sustainability, and investment stewardship—authoring numerous articles and participating in nearly 200 speaking events and media interviews.

 A former M&A attorney advising global corporations on complex cross-border transactions, Hasson also held senior roles at Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Deloitte, where he advised federal governments and Fortune 500 clients on shareholder engagement, governance reform, and ESG integration.

 “Gabe brings a truly distinctive combination of global experience, market insight, and leadership in governance and shareholder advisory—at a time when boards face mounting pressures to navigate capital markets with confidence,” said Tom Ryan, Founder and CEO of ICR. “Proactive shareholder engagement has become essential to strengthening governance, enhancing transparency, and building trust with the market. His credibility with institutional investors, deep understanding of stewardship priorities, and sophisticated approach to complex situations will enhance ICR’s ability to deliver value to clients across industries and market caps, building upon our leadership position as strategic advisors.”

 “ICR stands out as a strategic partner that deeply understands investor behavior and how to shape effective communication in both proactive and high-stakes contexts. I have long recognized ICR as a clear leader in the strategic communications and advisory business,” added Hasson. “I’m excited to join this talented and committed team, and I look forward to helping clients strengthen their governance practices, build trust, and respond with agility in today’s evolving landscape.”

 Hasson earned his law degree from Universidad Panamericana, as well as a certificate in U.S. Law from The George Washington Law School. He holds a master’s in international public policy from the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) at Johns Hopkins University, and a Certificate in Corporate Finance from Cornell University.

 ICR was recently ranked the #3 U.S. advisor on shareholder activism in the Bloomberg League Tables, and recognized among the best PR & communications firms for crisis and litigation advisory by Chambers and Partners, the world’s leading provider of legal rankings and insights.
