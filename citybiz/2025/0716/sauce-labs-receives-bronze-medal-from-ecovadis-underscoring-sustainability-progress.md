# Sauce Labs Receives Bronze Medal from EcoVadis, Underscoring Sustainability Progress

Sauce Labs, the leading platform for continuous quality, today announced it has been awarded a Bronze medal from EcoVadis, the global authority on business sustainability ratings. The recognition marks a major step forward in Sauce Labs’ environmental, social, and governance (ESG) journey and affirms the company’s growing role as a responsible partner to enterprise customers around the world.

 EcoVadis assessments span environmental impact, labor and human rights, ethics, and sustainable procurement. After undergoing its first full evaluation, Sauce Labs now ranks in the 57th percentile among its industry peers. The result highlights a solid operational foundation and a clear path forward for deeper sustainability integration across the business.

 The milestone comes amid a period of major transformation for Sauce Labs, as the company sharpens its focus on enterprise value, AI-driven quality signals, and operational excellence. From enhancing AI-powered testing capabilities to strengthening compliance in regulated markets, Sauce Labs is evolving to meet the moment—and sustainability is becoming a key part of that equation.

 “Our customers and partners are looking at product innovation and beyond,” said Dr. Prince Kohli, CEO of Sauce Labs. “They want to work with companies that share their values and commitment to responsible business practices. This recognition validates the work we’ve been doing and charts a clear path for continued improvement.”

 The assessment process brought together teams across Sauce Labs, including legal, operations, people, finance, and engineering. This cross-functional collaboration not only secured the Bronze rating but established internal processes and accountability structures that will drive ongoing sustainability efforts.

 For many of Sauce Labs’ largest customers—particularly in sectors like finance, retail, and telecom—ESG performance is no longer a nice-to-have, but a prerequisite for partnership. The Bronze rating now enables Sauce Labs to more easily align with procurement frameworks, RFPs, and onboarding processes that require documented sustainability credentials.

 “This is the starting line, not the finish,” added Kohli. “We’re going to keep pushing—deeper reporting, smarter initiatives, more impact—and we’re going to do it together.”

 Looking ahead, Sauce Labs plans to expand its sustainability roadmap with more rigorous data collection, emissions tracking, and supplier accountability efforts. The company also intends to embed ESG criteria more deeply into its internal planning, employee engagement, and corporate governance frameworks.
