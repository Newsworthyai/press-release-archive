# Pure Barre to Open First Mountain View Studio Led by Local Husband and Wife Team

Pure Barre, the largest barre workout brand in the United States, will celebrate the opening of its first location in Mountain View on July 17. Located at 125B E El Camino Real, local residents will gain access to Pure Barre’s challenging and proprietary barre technique. Designed to strengthen and tone, Pure Barre is a total body workout focused on a series of low impact, high intensity movements.

 The new Pure Barre studio in Mountain View will be owned by husband and wife team Sophia and John Lin. They met while earning their MBAs in Michigan and went on to build successful careers in investment banking. Their work took them to several cities and even overseas, but they ultimately chose to settle in Mountain View in 2018, where they are now raising their two children.

 Fitness has always been a priority for the Lins, but Pure Barre held a special place for Sophia. Over the years, she explored many types of workouts, but Pure Barre was the one she consistently returned to. It not only helped her stay active but also connected her with like-minded people who share her passion for wellness. After making Mountain View their home, Sophia and John wanted to establish roots and create something meaningful that would also benefit their community. Opening a Pure Barre studio was a natural fit.

 “We’ve always wanted to create something we’re proud of and excited about,” said John. “For us, Pure Barre is more than just exercise. It brings people together, promotes healthier lifestyles, and gives us a chance to be more involved in the community we love.

 Pure Barre has exploded in popularity with over 550,000 dedicated followers across North America due to its effective technique, friendly, high-energy atmosphere; and fun, motivating music. The new studio in Mountain View will offer an effective total body workout focused on low-impact, high intensity isometric movements that lift and tone muscles to improve strength, agility, and flexibility for everybody in 45-50 minutes. Each class is taught by highly trained teachers and features musically driven choreography for a continuously fresh full-body workout.
