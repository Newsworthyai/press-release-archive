# Ladew Gardens Honors the Legacy of Leith Symington Griswold with Named Director Role

Globally recognized destination Ladew Topiary Gardens is proud to announce the naming of its Director of Horticulture and Facilities position in honor of Leith Symington Griswold, one of the Garden’s visionary founders, whose legacy has shaped the Ladew that visitors know and love today. Leith, who passed away in 2013, was the matriarch of Baltimore’s Symington and Griswold families, an accomplished equestrian, fox-hunting enthusiast, and passionate gardener.

 In the late 1960s, Harvey Ladew, the original owner of what was then known as Pleasant Valley Farm, sought to preserve his beloved gardens. Leith, a leader in conservation and generous philanthropist, stepped forward and rallied a group of determined women and friends who ultimately founded Ladew Topiary Gardens, Inc. as a 501 c 3 non-profit, as it remains today. Her resolve and leadership transformed Pleasant Valley Farm into one of the most celebrated public gardens in the country, ensuring that this special oasis can be enjoyed by all who wish to visit.

 “Leith had an extraordinary connection to these gardens and was truly the driving force behind saving Ladew,” said Emily Emerick, the Anne and Robert Kinsley Executive Director of Ladew Gardens. “Without her tenacity and belief in the power of this place, it simply wouldn’t exist as we know it today. Naming this position in her honor is a fitting tribute to her deep roots here – both literal and figurative.”

 Leith’s early and generous support shaped the future of philanthropy at Ladew and made it possible for the gardens to thrive well into the next century. Her leadership extended beyond the founding of Ladew as she went on to serve as Board Chair after Harvey Ladew’s death. She played a pivotal role in launching the Patrons Circles, a cornerstone of Ladew’s fundraising efforts.

Her children and grandchildren, many of whom have served in leadership and volunteer roles, remain deeply involved in supporting the organization’s mission.

 Adrienne Gettman, who currently holds the role of Director of Horticulture and Facilities at Ladew, shared her appreciation for Griswold’s enduring influence. “I am honored to hold a position that now bears Leith Griswold’s name as her influence on Ladew is still felt today,” said Gettman. “Her vision and dedication inspire every decision we make in preserving and enhancing this historic landscape. We strive every day to continue her legacy through our work in the gardens she loved so dearly.”

 Ladew staff, supporters, and board members gathered in early June to toast Leith Symington Griswold and celebrate the profound impact of her vision, generosity, and leadership. To learn more about Ladew Gardens and its rich history, visit www.ladewgardens.com.
