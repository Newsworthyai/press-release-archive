# Woofie’s Joins Forces with American Kennel Club to Elevate Dog Grooming Standards Nationwide

Woofie’s®, a premier provider of personalized mobile pet care services, has announced a new nationwide collaboration with the American Kennel Club (AKC) to provide standardized grooming safety training and certifications to its franchise teams through the AKC S.A.F.E. (Safety, Assurance, Fundamentals, Education) Grooming Program.

 Through this collaboration, Woofie’s franchises across the country will complete the AKC Safety in the Salon courses, a comprehensive series of classes that cover best practices in pet care, health and safety protocols, accident prevention, sanitation, and handling of dogs with special needs.

 Upon completion, participating Woofie’s locations will become AKC S.A.F.E. Groomers and Salons, pledging to uphold the AKC Groomer/Salon Oath that “specifies a commitment to holding pet safety in the highest regard.” Certified locations will be listed on the AKC GroomerFinder and will post their certification seal to assure consumers that their Woofie’s groomer is trained with the best safety practices with the AKC S.A.F.E. Grooming Certification Program.

 For over 140 years, the AKC has been the leading advocate for all dogs—promoting responsible dog ownership and championing canine health and welfare. In 2015, AKC created a AKC S.A.F.E. grooming education and credentialing program, setting the highest industry standards nationwide for safety, skill, and service.

 “This collaboration between Woofie’s and the American Kennel Club reflects Woofie’s dedication to its clients and the communities they serve. By prioritizing groom safety across its franchises nationwide, Woofie’s is setting a high standard for the level of care they deliver,” said Gina M. DiNardo, President and CEO, AKC.

 Woofie’s Co-Founder and President Amy Addington said, “The American Kennel Club is the gold standard in the canine world, and this relationship reflects Woofie’s deep commitment to excellence. By ensuring all Woofie’s grooming professionals are trained and certified through the AKC’s S.A.F.E. program, we’re providing pet parents across the country with peace of mind. They can trust that their dogs are receiving the highest level of care and professionalism—values that are at the heart of everything Woofie’s stands for.”

 For over 21 years, Woofie’s has been the trusted name in pet care, offering grooming, walking, sitting, and mobile spa services. The solid relationship with the AKC—the nation’s leading authority on dog care, breed standards, and canine health—cements Woofie’s dedication to enhancing industry best practices and advancing pet well-being nationwide.
