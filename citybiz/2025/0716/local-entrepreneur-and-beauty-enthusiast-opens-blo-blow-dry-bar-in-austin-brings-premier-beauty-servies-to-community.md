# Local Entrepreneur and Beauty Enthusiast Opens Blo Blow Dry Bar in Austin, Brings Premier Beauty Servies to Community

Blo Blow Dry Bar, North America’s original blow dry bar and blow dry bar franchise, recently opened its newest bar in the Goodnight Ranch community. Located at 9021 Goodnight Ranch Blvd., the bar offers guests five signature styles on its hair menu, a la carte options, a variety of hair treatments, plus five signature makeup looks and a brand new section of customized looks to provide endless inspiration.

 Local resident Laurie Vazquez-Campagna is the entrepreneur behind Blo Blow Dry Bar Goodnight Ranch, offering a chic and welcoming space for locals to look and feel their best. As someone who gets her hair done weekly, Vazquez-Campagna was inspired to introduce the brand to the area, ensuring her neighbors have access to a chic beauty location. With Goodnight Ranch emerging as a vibrant neighborhood, and the surrounding Easton Park and Southeast Austin areas rapidly developing, Vazquez-Campagna hopes Blo Blow Dry Bar is one of many businesses to enter the area, making Goodnight Ranch a premier Austin destination.

 “There aren’t many beauty resources east of I-35, and I wanted to change that by creating a place where everyone – whether they need a blowout or professional makeup services – can feel pampered and confident,” said Vazquez-Campagna. “At Blo Blow Dry Bar, we welcome guests young and old and take pride in helping them love what they see in the mirror after every visit.”

 Blo Blow Dry Bar is on a mission to create a space where people of all ages, ethnicities, and orientations are welcomed, represented, and made to feel gorgeous while emphasizing the need for self-care and wellness. Combining a sophisticated design with a fun and energetic environment, Blo cultivates a seamless and enjoyable experience for guests upon their arrival, during, and after their services. Expertly trained blo-ers are available for consultation seven days a week to meet the needs of all guests. The brand’s hair menu includes five signature styles from sleek and straight to bouncy curls, plus a wide assortment of customized looks including updo’s and braids. Blo Blow Dry Bar also offers makeup services from expert artists on hand to help guests look and feel amazing for any occasion.
