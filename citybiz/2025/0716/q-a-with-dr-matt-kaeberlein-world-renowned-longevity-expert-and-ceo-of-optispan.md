 You’ve spent decades studying the biology of aging—what made you decide to move from academia into the clinical side of longevity with the launch of Optispan?

 There were a few key factors. In many ways, this move is a natural progression of my professional journey. I started studying the biology of aging as a grad student in 1998, initially drawn to the complexity of the science — using genetics, molecular biology, and biochemistry to understand this intricate process. At that point, aging wasn’t personal for me. I saw the potential long-term health impact, but I was really driven by the mystery and challenge of the system.

 Much of that early work was in simple organisms like yeast and nematode worms — models that were tractable for studying things like lifespan, which is the gold standard for testing genetic or pharmacological interventions. Over time, my research moved into more complex organisms, including pet dogs living in real-world environments, and now into human health.

 Alongside that scientific evolution, I also began shifting from basic research to translational science and now, full clinical application. So there’s a clear through line — from model organisms to people, and from discovery to impact.

 By 2019, I also realized I was burned out in academia. I’m not someone who bashes academic research — it’s foundational — but I found that too much of my time was being spent on things that weren’t meaningful or enjoyable. I needed a change. I explored a few biotech roles, but they didn’t feel like the right fit.

 Then I met Dave Sabi, founder of Sabi Corporation. We quickly aligned on a shared mission: to bring better health optimization solutions to more people. That led to deep conversations about the friction points in today’s healthcare system and how we could make a real impact — and ultimately to the creation of OptiSpan.

 For me, it felt like the right moment to apply everything I’ve learned — the science, the experience, the systems thinking — to something that could tangibly improve health, quality of life, and longevity for many people.

 Optispan positions itself as a science-first longevity platform. How do you ensure the interventions you offer are backed by the most rigorous and up-to-date aging research?

 Great question. First, I’d reframe it slightly: while we do offer interventions, our focus is on delivering proactive, evidence-based medical care. We’re not just handing out supplements or treatments — we’re building comprehensive, personalized programs designed to optimize long-term health.

 That begins with a deep evaluation of each individual’s current health status — using diagnostics, biomarker testing, and medical history — so we can understand their baseline and tailor a plan to reduce risk and extend healthspan.

 Our core interventions are built on four foundational lifestyle pillars:

 * Eat (nutrition)
* Move (physical activity)
* Sleep (quality and consistency)
* Connect (purpose, relationships, and mental well-being — including with companion animals)

 For most people, improving these pillars delivers the greatest return in health outcomes. Beyond that, we offer targeted, personalized recommendations — including supplements when there’s strong evidence to support their use — but we’re more conservative than many in the longevity or functional medicine space. We’re not about overloading people with pills.

 We also use prescription medications when appropriate — both in traditional, reactive care (e.g., treating high blood pressure) and in proactive, off-label uses when supported by biomarkers and scientific evidence. Off-label prescribing is a common, FDA-permitted practice when physicians believe it’s in the patient’s best interest.

 Finally, we ensure every intervention is monitored over time through ongoing coaching, physician check-ins, and regular biomarker testing. That’s how we verify both effectiveness and safety — and how we stay aligned with the latest, most rigorous research in aging and preventative care.

 One of the biggest challenges in longevity care is distinguishing hype from evidence. What biomarkers or diagnostics do you believe are most predictive of biological aging, and how are they integrated into Optispan’s approach?

 I love the concept of biological aging — but as a measurable quantity, it’s often misused. There’s currently no precise or clinically validated way to measure biological age. Many so-called “biological age tests” are either misleading or not actionable.

 Instead, at OptiSpan, we focus on proven biomarkers that estimate risk — for mortality, chronic diseases, and functional decline — and that can be meaningfully improved. We prioritize what’s actionable.

 Our approach starts with comprehensive biomarker testing, far beyond what’s offered in standard primary care. This includes:

 * Metabolic health markers: Beyond glucose and A1C, we measure insulin and insulin sensitivity, which are better predictors of metabolic disease.
* Advanced lipid panels: Including ApoB, Lp(a), and particle size — all strong indicators of cardiovascular risk.
* Hormones: We evaluate hormonal health comprehensively for both men and women, especially during midlife.
* Inflammation markers: Chronic inflammation is a key driver of age-related disease.
* Nutrient levels: Including vitamin D, omega-3s, and more — all modifiable through diet and supplementation.
* Toxins and heavy metals: To identify and mitigate environmental exposures.

 We also incorporate imaging, like:

 * DEXA scans for body composition (fat distribution, bone density, and muscle mass).
* POCUS (point-of-care ultrasound) to screen for fatty liver, thyroid nodules, and carotid plaque.
* Advanced scans (as needed), including whole-body MRI, coronary CTA (to detect soft plaque), and brain MRI for cognitive risk assessment.

 Physical and functional assessments are also key — including VO₂ max, strength, agility, flexibility, and cognitive testing.

 Finally, we use genetic testing (both single gene variants and polygenic risk scores). While genes aren’t modifiable, they help clarify disease risk and can motivate behavior change. For example, knowing someone carries the ApoE4 variant (linked to increased risk for Alzheimer’s and heart disease) can drive deeper engagement with lifestyle interventions.

 Once sequenced, a person’s genome doesn’t change — but our understanding of it will. That means the insights we can draw from genetic data will only become more powerful over time.

 In sum, our philosophy is: skip the hype and focus on what’s measurable, modifiable, and meaningful.

 There’s growing debate about whether longevity interventions should be targeted at the general population or the already health-optimized. Who is the ideal patient for Optispan—and how do you balance personalization with scalability?

 I believe longevity is for everyone. The goal isn’t just more years — it’s more healthy years. So, the idea that longevity care should only be for the already optimized doesn’t make sense to me.

 In fact, very few people are truly health-optimized. Many who think they are — especially in the hardcore biohacker community — are often missing key pieces, like muscle mass, hormonal balance, or meaningful social connection. We see this firsthand. Their biomarkers might look good on the surface, but deeper testing reveals gaps that increase long-term risk.

 That said, the average American has far more room for improvement — and greater opportunity for impact. With over 60% of Americans having at least one chronic condition, there’s enormous low-hanging fruit. We’ve seen patients in our programs dramatically improve their health — sometimes by catching serious conditions early, other times through sustained lifestyle and biomarker improvement. We believe that for the average 40-year-old, true healthspan medicine could add 10–15 healthy years without extreme interventions.

 Scalability is, of course, the biggest challenge. Today we run both a premium concierge program and a more accessible corporate health offering. The latter, which we’ve deployed at Sabi Corporation, helps us test what delivers 80% of the benefit at 20% of the cost — a model that could eventually work for insurers or public health.

 We’re also investing heavily in automation and AI — especially agentic AI — to bring personalized care to more people. We’re building tools that let providers query rich diagnostic data and generate insights, while also giving patients 24/7 AI support based on their personal health information. This kind of digital “healthspan assistant” will soon be able to guide nutrition, exercise, medication, and sleep — all in real time.

 Of course, privacy and accessibility must be handled with care. But for those who opt in, AI could be a major equalizer — bringing high-quality, personalized care to people who’ve traditionally lacked access due to geography or cost. That’s the future we’re building toward.

 You’ve previously expressed both enthusiasm and caution around drugs like rapamycin. How does Optispan approach pharmaceutical interventions for aging—and where do you draw the line on what’s clinically appropriate versus still too experimental?

 At OptiSpan, pharmaceutical interventions are always a personalized decision between the doctor and the patient. Our guiding question is simple: Does the potential benefit clearly outweigh the potential risk? It’s rarely black and white, but we can make informed, probabilistic assessments based on current data.

 This applies to all interventions — including off-label or experimental therapies like rapamycin. We stay up to date with the latest scientific and clinical research, and we also rely on our own internal data, using quarterly biomarker assessments to track whether an intervention is working as intended. If we see biomarkers heading in the wrong direction, we reassess and adjust the plan.

 That said, we draw a firm line at unregulated or offshore treatments. We avoid anything that falls into legal or ethical gray areas — like exosomes or certain stem cell therapies — because of the lack of FDA oversight and quality control. It’s unfortunate, because we do believe some of these therapies hold real promise. But without proper regulation, the risks — including inconsistent dosing and contamination — are just too high.

 Ultimately, we believe in science-driven care, not hype — and we’ll continue to adjust as the evidence and regulatory landscape evolve.

 The longevity field is exploding with innovation. What are some new or emerging tools, therapies, or diagnostics you’re most excited about that Optispan may integrate in the future?

 While there’s a lot of buzz in the longevity space, I wouldn’t say there’s an explosion of clinically viable innovation just yet. Many therapies — like stem cells or exosomes — are intriguing, but due to lack of regulatory clarity and quality control, we’re not comfortable offering them in our programs at this time.

 One intervention we’re actively exploring is therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). It’s an FDA-approved procedure (commonly used for autoimmune conditions), and while using it for longevity is off-label, it shows promise. The concept stems from heterochronic parabiosis studies, where old mice connected to young mice experienced improved health and lifespan — likely due to the dilution of pro-aging factors in the blood. TPE may mimic this effect by removing aging-related factors, toxins, and inflammatory agents.

 There’s also some early, encouraging data suggesting it may slow cognitive decline in conditions like dementia. I recently underwent the procedure myself — it was straightforward and safe, just a bit time-consuming.

 We’re still evaluating whether to offer TPE more broadly, but it may be appropriate for select patients with high inflammation, toxic burden (e.g. mercury or microplastics), or cognitive concerns.

 As for stem cells and exosomes, we’re watching the space closely. If and when the regulatory environment improves and sourcing becomes reliable, we may consider integrating them — either in-house or through trusted partners.

 Ultimately, how do you define success for Optispan—not just in terms of business growth, but in actually moving the needle on healthy lifespan for your patients?

 For me, success starts with individual stories. Seeing real people improve their health and quality of life has been the most rewarding part of moving from the lab to the clinic. My own health has improved since starting this journey, and we’ve had many patients experience transformative results. That’s a huge measure of success.

 But the bigger goal is scale — building a platform that enables medical professionals, from doctors to healthspan coaches, to deliver science-based, personalized care to many more people. We’re not aiming to go direct-to-consumer. Instead, we want to empower providers with the tools and systems to offer true 21st-century healthspan medicine.

 Finally, success also means helping elevate the field as a whole — bringing more scientific rigor, establishing best practices, and guiding the conversation around what’s truly evidence-based versus still experimental. If we can do that, we’ll have made a meaningful impact beyond just our own patients.
