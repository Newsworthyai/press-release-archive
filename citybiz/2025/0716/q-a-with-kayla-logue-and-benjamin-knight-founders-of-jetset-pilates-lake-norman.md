# Q&amp;A with Kayla Logue and Benjamin Knight, Founders of JETSET Pilates Lake Norman

Kayla Logue and Benjamin Knight are the dynamic duo behind JETSET Pilates Lake Norman, bringing a fresh wave of energy, entrepreneurship, and community-driven wellness to Huntersville, NC. With a powerful blend of business acumen and wellness leadership, they’re not only opening doors to their new studio but also to a new standard of luxury fitness in the region. Their studio, located at 8908 Lindholm Dr., officially opened its doors on June 15, offering the Lake Norman community an elevated Reformer Pilates experience rooted in physical strength, mental clarity, and connection.

 Kayla, a bestselling author, nonprofit founder, and top-performing real estate professional, brings more than a decade of experience in wellness and leadership to the studio. Her deep understanding of Pilates, having coached over 1,000 classes, pairs with a broader mission to promote sustainable health through her nonprofit, Move Into Words. Ben, a seasoned entrepreneur and former land development leader, brings his own transformative journey with Pilates into the studio, aiming to redefine how men approach the practice. Together, they are more than franchisees; they are builders of a movement.

 JETSET’s innovative, efficient, and empowering style of true Modern Pilates perfectly aligns with the active lifestyle and community energy of Lake Norman

 Kayla and Ben are committed to growing a vibrant, wellness-focused community across North Carolina. Through curated events, expert-led classes, and intentional leadership, they are proving that Pilates is more than a workout; it’s a lifestyle.

 What inspired you to launch a Pilates studio, and why did you ultimately choose to partner with JETSET over other fitness concepts?

 We were both drawn to Pilates because of how incredibly transformative the workout is—not just physically, but mentally. After years of working in high-intensity fitness and recovering from personal injuries, we realized how essential low-impact strength and longevity-focused movement is. JETSET stood out because it was modern, music-driven, community-focused, and unlike anything else in the market—merging the structure of Pilates with the energy of boutique fitness.

 Can you walk me through your background in the fitness industry and share any previous ventures you’ve been involved in?

 Kayla has over a decade of experience in the fitness industry, ranging from personal training to coaching over 1,000 reformer Pilates classes and leading operations at multiple studio concepts. She’s also the founder of a wellness nonprofit and bestselling author. Ben comes from the construction, real estate development and entrepreneurship world. His personal transformation through fitness reshaped his outlook on health and purpose—ultimately inspiring him to help others experience that same sense of empowerment through movement.

 Why did you choose the Lake Norman area for your JETSET location, and how do you see Pilates enhancing the local health and wellness community?

 We both live in the Lake Norman area and saw an exciting opportunity to bring something new and needed to the growing wellness-forward population here. JETSET’s innovative, efficient, and empowering style of true Modern Pilates perfectly aligns with the active lifestyle and community energy of Lake Norman. Our goal is to not only enhance physical wellness but create a space of belonging, motivation, and self-investment.

 For those unfamiliar with the brand, how does JETSET Pilates differ from traditional Pilates or other reformer-based workouts?

 JETSET is a modern, beat-based approach to Pilates that emphasizes intensity, precision, and intentional movement—all on a custom reformer designed exclusively for JETSET. Each class delivers a high-energy, full-body sculpt designed to build long-term strength, endurance, and mobility. We also pride ourselves on white-glove customer service—something that’s felt not just during the workout, but in every touchpoint of the client’s experience with us.

 Who is your ideal client, and how do you hope JETSET Pilates will support their fitness and overall well-being?

 Our ideal client is someone who wants to feel strong, confident, and supported in their fitness journey—regardless of where they’re starting. From athletes looking to supplement performance, to busy professionals wanting an efficient yet challenging workout, JETSET is a results-driven, community-centered space where people can prioritize longevity and alignment in both body and mind.

 What has been the most rewarding part of launching this studio so far, and what are your goals for the first year in business?

 The most rewarding part has been building a loyal, inspiring community that genuinely loves showing up—for themselves and for each other. Watching clients grow stronger physically and mentally, and hearing how JETSET has become the best part of their day, has been incredibly fulfilling. Our goal in year one is to solidify our studio as the premier Pilates experience in the area, grow a passionate team, and continue delivering an unmatched client experience as we continue to expand to our other locations in the Charlotte market.
