# First Downs and Fundamentals: Rock Hill Football Camp Empowers Young Athletes

Inspiring the next generation of athletes, The Community Partnership Foundation (The CPF) partnered with former Buffalo Bills safety Jonathan Meeks to host its second Football C.A.M.P. at Rock Hill High School. The community advancement mentorship program – which was offered to sports enthusiasts between the ages of 7 and 15 for free, thanks to the contributions made by local organizations – blended personal development with athletic training, creating a competitive yet supportive atmosphere.

 The summer camp, taught by Meeks and other former NFL athletes, college players and coaches, featured football drills, games and activities, in addition to lectures on the importance of mental health, financial literacy and community involvement.

 “The Community Partnership Foundation launched the Jonathan Meeks Football C.A.M.P. because we believe in creating meaningful, hands-on experiences that inspire and empower our youth,” said Board Chair of The Community Partnership Foundation, Debbie Garrick. “Jonathan’s passion for this program and the deep commitment we have to our community are what bring it to life year after year.”
