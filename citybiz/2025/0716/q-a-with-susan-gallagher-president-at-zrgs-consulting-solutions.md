# Q&amp;A with Susan Gallagher, President at ZRG’s Consulting Solutions

Susan Gallagher is President of ZRG’s Consulting Solutions, leading strategy and growth for the firm’s global consulting business. A seasoned professional services executive, she previously served as CEO of Bravanti, guiding it through a successful management buyout and sale to ZRG. Earlier, she held leadership roles at BPI group in Paris, Patina Solutions, and was a founding Managing Director at Huron Consulting Group. She began her career as a partner at Arthur Andersen.

 A culture of radical curiosity and zero pretense. We’re building a team obsessed with our clients’ toughest problems—and brave enough to tell the truth, even when it’s uncomfortable.

 You’ve joined one of the fastest-growing talent advisory firms in the world. What made you say “yes” to ZRG?

 The people. Hands down. There’s a restless energy here—a conviction that the old way of doing things isn’t enough. I wanted to be part of building something bolder for clients and for our own people. I’ve spent my career helping organizations unlock human potential, and ZRG is the perfect place to push that mission forward.

 In your new role, you’ve been tasked with expanding and integrating ZRG’s global consulting platform. What’s the first thing you’re doing differently?

 We are putting people together differently. Too many consulting firms operate in disconnected pieces. We’re building one team that collaborates across functions and geographies—focused entirely on helping clients achieve results. And with solutions that are unique to their specific needs.

 You’ve held top roles at some of the most respected firms in the industry. What defining moments/decisions have most shaped your ability to challenge the status quo?

 Early in my career, I worked on crisis situations where the usual playbook simply failed. I saw how sticking to conventional wisdom leads to safe, incremental changes, but rarely transformation. Since then, I’ve believed in one thing: Real value often comes from breaking down existing frameworks and building something new. I’ve never been afraid to challenge the way it’s “always been done.”

 What kind of culture are you building inside the ZRG Consulting team—and how will clients feel the difference?

 A culture of radical curiosity and zero pretense. We’re building a team obsessed with our clients’ toughest problems—and brave enough to tell the truth, even when it’s uncomfortable. Clients will feel it immediately. We’re not here to nod along politely. We’re here to help them achieve outcomes they thought were impossible. This practical and people-focused approach doesn’t apply to just ZRG Consulting, but to all of ZRG. It’s what makes our culture so distinct and, again, our clients feel it.

 Consulting is evolving fast—what do you believe needs to be disrupted in the industry today?

 The notion that consulting is about delivering a fancy slide deck and moving on. We need to disrupt the idea that consulting is about having all the answers. It’s not. It’s about alignment and activation. Strategy is meaningless unless people execute it. The real disruption is shifting from “advice-giving” to helping leaders align their teams, change behaviors, and make new ways of working stick. Consulting should be measured by outcomes, not PowerPoint pages.

 Organizations need partners who can move with them, build with them, and build human systems that impact the results, and ensure the change sticks. The real disruption is addressing the human-first impact on a business.

 Why do so many traditional firms miss the mark when it comes to aligning leadership, culture, and strategy—and how is ZRG structured differently to get it right?

 At ZRG, we’ve flipped the playbook. We start with alignment of people and minds — across the executive team, across the enterprise — and then build solutions that drive real behavioral change and business results. Our structure is lean, collaborative, and built for impact.

 Do you believe there’s room to create a new category of consulting—one that puts talent and execution at the center of business strategy?

 Absolutely. For too long, talent has been treated like an afterthought—something to deal with after the strategy’s been decided. That’s backwards. Even the most brilliant strategies fail when organizations lack the right people, capabilities, and execution.

 The next era of consulting puts human potential at the core. It’s about blending talent, culture, and strategy into one seamless flow. That’s the category we’re creating.

 If there’s one thing you want clients and colleagues to understand about this next phase of ZRG Consulting, what would it be?

 That we’re here to break the mold. We’re deeply experienced, but unafraid to challenge conventional thinking. We’re partners who show up with urgency, speak the truth, and stay until the real work is done. This is about helping leaders solve the problems that keep them awake at night—and doing it in ways that actually sticks.

 Fast forward one year: What headline would you love to see written about your work at ZRG?
