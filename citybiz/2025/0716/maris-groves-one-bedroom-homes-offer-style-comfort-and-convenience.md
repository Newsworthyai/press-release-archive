# Maris Grove’s One-Bedroom Homes Offer Style, Comfort, and Convenience

For many retirees, finding the right balance of space, lifestyle, affordability, and convenience is key when selecting a new home.

 At Maris Grove, an Erickson Senior Living community in the Brandywine Valley of Pennsylvania, one-bedroom residences offer ample space for at-home hobbies, worry-free living, value, and access to state-of-the-art amenities.

 The perfect fit

 Linda Ferraro, originally from northern Delaware, was living in a three-bedroom house when she decided it was time to downsize.

 “I knew I didn’t need three bedrooms,” she says, which is what led her to consider moving into a one-bedroom residence. But, as an avid quilter, “I had to have a place to bring my sewing stuff with me,” she says.

 When Linda discovered Maris Grove’s one-bedroom residences, she knew she had found the community for her. She opted for the Brighton floor plan–a one-bedroom, one-bath design with a large living area–which provided her with both comfortable living quarters and a functional quilting setup.

 “One table has my sewing machine, scissors, and rulers on it. I can store my fabrics [on shelves] above the table,” she says.

 She was also drawn to the large bay window. “When I first saw this home, that’s what took my attention–the large bay window. Being on the top floor, I can see so much. That was one of the reasons why I wanted this floor plan,” she says.

 A shared hobby

 While she enjoys quilting in her home, Linda appreciates having access to additional community spaces, especially those conveniently located right in her building.

 “One of the rooms on the first floor in Bluebird Crossing has big tables,” she notes. “On weekends, they aren’t used as often, so when I have to put a quilt together, I’ll bring down the different parts of the quilt and pin it there.”

 Living in a vibrant community has also allowed Linda to connect with fellow quilters. She recently joined a sewing group of about ten women who enjoy various forms of needlework, from embroidery to knitting.

 She even found a new interest, thanks to the group. “I bought embroidery kits. It’ll kind of be a new hobby,” she shares. “The other residents are very helpful. I’m learning from them too.”

 More than just a home

 One of the greatest advantages of living at Maris Grove is that residents gain far more than just a comfortable home. From fitness classes and social groups to on-site restaurants and entertainment, the opportunities for engagement are endless.

 Linda has fully embraced this active lifestyle, participating in a cardio drumming class that she describes as “so fun and a real workout.”

 As a lifelong musician, she also plans to play piano for an upcoming prayer service and is considering joining the recorder group.

 For Linda, having access to these resources while still enjoying the privacy of her own space is invaluable. “I really have so much more space than just my home that I can use,” she says.

 Financial peace of mind

 The affordability of a one-bedroom home and the financial predictability Maris Grove offers also played a role in Linda’s decision to move.

 “I’m on a fixed budget, so the monthly service package helps me plan. And there are things that I don’t have to worry about, like cutting the grass or shoveling snow,” she explains.

 Brett Haas, sales director at Maris Grove, emphasizes the financial benefits of living in the community.

 “As a fee-for-service community, residents only pay for the services they need,” he explains. “Our predictable monthly service package covers maintenance, utilities, a meal plan, and more, making it easier to manage your budget.”

 A welcoming community

 On top of the right balance between space, lifestyle, affordability, and convenience, Linda has found that Maris Grove offers a welcoming environment.

 “People don’t realize what a great place this is,” she says. “Once you come here, you feel it from the residents and the staff. I am so happy I’m here.”

 For retirees looking for a vibrant, worry-free lifestyle with financial stability and a welcoming atmosphere, Maris Grove’s one-bedroom floor plans provide an ideal solution–proof that sometimes, less really is more.
