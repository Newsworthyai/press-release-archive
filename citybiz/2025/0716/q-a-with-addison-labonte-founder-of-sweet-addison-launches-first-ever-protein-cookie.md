# Q&amp;A with Addison Labonte, Founder of Sweet Addison Launches First Ever Protein Cookie

Just in time for those midday cravings and post-workout snacks, Sweet Addison’s is launching their first-ever Protein Cookie with Texas-based wellness expert Taylor Dukes (332K IG).The cookie is packed with 17g of protein thanks to Taylor’s signature Unflavored Bone Broth Protein Powder and is free of grains, dairy, soy, refined sugars, preservatives, and more. Each cookie is a delicious way to fuel your body, whether you’re headed to a workout, chasing kids around the house, or just looking for a better-for-you treat that satisfies your sweet tooth and helps you meet your protein goals. It’s a go-to for that 3 p.m. crash, a clean option post-run, or even a high-protein dessert that won’t spike your blood sugar.

 For some more background on Sweet Addison’s, the clean dessert brand founded by a D1 runner and foodfluencer, Addison Labonte, is reimagining nostalgic baked goods such as Pumpkin Choc Chips, Brookies, Caramel-Stuffed Cookies, Oatmeal Raisin, and more, all made with real ingredients.

 What inspired you to create a protein cookie, and why was now the right time to launch it?

 We’ve always wanted to expand into the protein space and a protein cookie felt like the perfect fit. Our customers love treats that taste nostalgic but also align with their wellness goals—and a cookie packed with clean protein was a natural next step. The timing just felt right—people are more conscious than ever about what they’re putting into their bodies, and they’re looking for snacks that deliver on both flavor and function.

 

 How did your collaboration with Taylor Dukes Wellness come about, and what was it like creating something together?

 Taylor has been a longtime supporter of the brand and really embodies what we’re all about—balance, wellness, and real ingredients. The partnership happened really organically. We’ve enjoyed each other’s products for a while now. Working together was such a fun, creative process—we blended our knowledge and taste preferences to create something that feels truly special.

 What makes the Protein Cookie different from other protein snacks or healthy cookies on the market?

 So many protein snacks compromise on taste or texture—or they’re full of questionable ingredients. We didn’t want to settle. Our cookie is soft-baked, craveable, and made with simple, nutrient-dense ingredients. It’s high in protein and fiber, but still tastes like something you’d sneak from your grandma’s cookie jar. That balance is what sets it apart.

 Sweet Addison’s is known for nostalgic flavors with a better-for-you twist. How did you balance taste and function in this cookie?

 That balance is always at the heart of what we do. With the Protein Cookie, we worked hard to make sure every bite delivered on that sweet, nostalgic cookie flavor, but with ingredients that serve a purpose—like 100% bone broth protein powder, almond flour, and no refined sugars. We went through so many test batches to get the flavor, texture, and nutrition just right. It’s a cookie you can feel good about eating every day.

 What’s next for Sweet Addison’s? Any new flavors or functional twists on the horizon?

 Absolutely—we’re always dreaming up what’s next! We’re playing with a few seasonal flavors. Our goal is to keep evolving with what our community wants while staying true to our roots: nostalgic treats made better.
