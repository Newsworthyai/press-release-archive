# Local Businesswoman Brings Empowerment and Confidence to Plano with New Blo Blow Dry Bar

Blo Blow Dry Bar, North America’s original blow dry bar and blow dry bar franchise, opened its bar in Plano on April 11. Located at 1900 Preston Road, Suite 134, the bar offers guests five signature styles on its hair menu, a la carte options, a variety of hair treatments, plus five signature makeup looks and a brand-new section of customized looks to provide endless inspiration.

 The bar is owned and operated by local entrepreneur Shannon Myers Ambrozy, a seasoned global consultant and strategy expert with over 20 years of experience helping businesses grow and make an impact. Her career has taken her around the world, from working with businesses in South Africa and New Zealand to developing clean water solutions for Africa. In September 2023, an unexpected rotator cuff surgery left her unable to lift her arm over her shoulder, making even simple tasks like washing her hair a challenge. Searching for a solution, she discovered Blo Blow Dry Bar. One visit was all it took—she was hooked. The experience not only made her feel better post-surgery but also opened her eyes to the power of self-care. She saw firsthand how a simple blowout could lift someone’s spirits, whether they were recovering from surgery, having a tough day, or preparing for a special occasion.

 “As a Plano high school alumnus and the 2016 recipient of the National Association of Professional Women VIP Woman of the Year Circle Award, empowering women has always been my passion,” shared Shannon. “I’ve spent much of my career as the only woman in the room, carving out my own space. With Blo, that dynamic has shifted. I’m excited to bring this empowering space to Plano and create a place where women feel confident and supported.”

 Blo Blow Dry Bar is on a mission to create a space where people of all ages, ethnicities, and orientations are welcomed, represented, and made to feel gorgeous while emphasizing the need for self-care and wellness.
