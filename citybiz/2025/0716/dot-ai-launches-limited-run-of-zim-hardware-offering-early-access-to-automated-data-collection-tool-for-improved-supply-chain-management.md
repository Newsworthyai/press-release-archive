# Dot Ai Launches Limited Run of ZiM Hardware, Offering Early Access to Automated Data Collection Tool for Improved Supply Chain Management

Dot Ai (Nasdaq: DAIC), an IoT and AI-based SaaS startup at the forefront of Asset Intelligence technology, today announced that a limited-production run of its patent-pending ZiM (Zero Infrastructure Mesh) Bridge is now available for exclusive ‘early-bird’ order. The highly-anticipated ZiM Bridge stands to eliminate outdated, manual inventory management tools—such as RFID hand-scanners—and transform asset and supply chain management through real-time, automated data collection.

 The ZiM Bridge is a compact device, about the length and width of a smartphone that, when strategically placed in an environment such as a warehouse or manufacturing plant, continuously and automatically scans the area, collecting asset tag information for real-time visibility. The patent-pending ZiM hardware was engineered to be layered with API integrations to existing Enterprise and Vertical SaaS solutions, and Dot Ai’s AI-powered SaaS platform, for comprehensive operational visibility that can transform businesses and supply chain management across industries.

 “Our ZiM Bridge marks a turning point for modern logistics. It’s more than a new tool—it’s a strategic enabler for businesses to finally leave behind decades-old systems and unlock the power of real-time, autonomous Asset Intelligence,” said Ed Nabrotzky, Dot Ai CEO. “With minimal infrastructure costs and plug-and-play simplicity, the ZiM Bridge gives operations teams what they’ve been asking for: reliable data, automated tracking, and AI-driven insights—without hardware headaches or manual effort.”

 The industry-disrupting ZiM Bridge is currently being manufactured in Dot Ai’s Puerto Rico-based facility, which the Company announced last week is open and operational. The Company hopes to expand operations to meet global demand while bolstering the island’s economic and industrial resiliency.

 This first-come-first-serve production run of the ZiM Bridge is available now, and customers can schedule a demo, request pricing details, and find more information on the Dot Ai website at https://daic.ai/. With no fixed cost to install, customers can unlock AI-enhanced predictive analytics with accuracy and reliability to increase revenue, improve customer experience, and reduce risk. General availability of the ZiM Bridge is expected to be rolled out over the coming months.
