# Critical Metals Corp Launches Drilling Program in Greenland to Position Tanbreez for Commercial Production

* Advances Feasibility Study and Seeks to Boost Resource Estimate Ahead of Q4 2025 Milestones
* Positions Mine for Commercial Production, which is Expected in 2026, to Address Growing Demand in the West

 Critical Metals Corp. (Nasdaq: CRML), a leading critical minerals mining company, is today pleased to announce a 2000m resource diamond drilling program has commenced at the Tanbreez Rare Earth Project in Greenland.

 CEO and Executive Chairman Tony Sage commented:

 “Launching our fiscal 2025 drilling campaign at Tanbreez is an important investment and step in our efforts to bring this game-changing rare earth asset into production as soon as possible to meet the growing demand in the United States and the West more broadly for rare earth material. To kick off this campaign, we have already installed a new drilling rig, which is expected to enable us to significantly increase the size of our resource estimate. This new drilling program is designed to significantly increase the size of the current Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) and support the development of the Bankable Feasibility Study (BFS), paving the way for a final decision to mine. As we progress with our fiscal 2025 drilling campaign, we expect to release new drill results from our 2024 campaign to further verify the immense potential of Tanbreez.”

 Drilling Campaign Highlights

 * The 2000m drilling program is targeting to significantly increase the size of the existing MRE for the Fjord Eudialyte Deposit presently at indicated resource of 8.76Mt and inferred resource of 13.8Mt, totaling 22.56Mt.
* The first drill hole, K25-01 has been collared and down to approximately 60m in outcropping kakortokite host containing rare earth elements within mineralized eudialyte. The first 60m core shows medium grained eudialyte with 30% -40% composition, (see Figures 1, 2 and 3).
* The resource drilling will target further resource extension to the east of the existing Fjord Deposit of approximately 700m and 650m along strike of the North-East to South-West strike kakortokite host rock. The target depths for the vertical drill holes will range from 80m to 250m over the undulating topography.
* The program is being spearheaded by Critical Metals Corp’s experienced Greenland drilling contractor, 60 North Greenland, and acclaimed rare earth geologists.

 Next Steps

 Critical Metals Corp’s full exploration and DFS study teams are now on site, conducting detailed fieldwork. The data collected will play a key role in finalizing the BFS and preparing the comprehensive reports required by the Greenland regulators, as well as the Company’s proposed financial partners, including EXIM, the Export-Important Bank of the United States. The Company remains on track to deliver these final reports by Q4 2025.
