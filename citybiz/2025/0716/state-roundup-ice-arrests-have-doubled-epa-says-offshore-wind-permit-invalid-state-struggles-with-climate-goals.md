# State Roundup: ICE Arrests Have Doubled; EPA Says Offshore Wind Permit Invalid; State Struggles With Climate Goals

ICE ARRESTS IN MARYLAND HAVE DOUBLED: Since President Donald Trump returned to office, his campaign to deport thousands of immigrants has created headlines in Maryland after dispatching federal agents to sweep the streets, raiding worksites and, in one case, removing a mother from her vehicle. Now, government records reveals the scale of these efforts: Arrests by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officers have more than doubled in the state under Trump.

 EPA SAYS OC OFFSHORE WIND PROJECT PERMIT IS INVALID: Developers behind the wind project off the coast of Ocean City have just about everything they need to start building. At least, they thought they did. Last week, the U.S. EPA sent a letter to Maryland regulators informing them that the state’s air quality permit isn’t valid. While the letter dings Maryland regulators for a procedural aspect of their permit, it comes as President Donald Trump has attempted to block and roll back offshore wind development across the country.

 STATE STRUGGLES TO MEET CLIMATE GOAL DEADLINES: As the planet logs some of its warmest years on record, Maryland is trying to make good on some of the most ambitious climate goals in the country. But the state is struggling to keep up with deadlines it set for itself. Maryland is halfway to its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2031, though progress has been at a standstill since 2020. The state has another, more ambitious goal on the horizon: net zero emissions by 2045. Rachel McCrea of Capital News Service/Maryland Reporter.

 MOORE TAPS CARROLL COMMISH TO RUN VETERANS DEPT: Gov. Wes Moore tapped Ed Rothstein, a Carroll County commissioner and retired Army colonel, to lead the Maryland Department of Veterans and Military Families. “Ed Rothstein has dedicated his career to serving this country and the people of Maryland,” Moore said in a statement Monday. “I am honored that he has raised his hands once again to serve the state as Maryland’s next secretary of the Department of Veterans and Military Families.” Hannah Gaskill/The Baltimore Sun.

 * Rothstein takes over as secretary on Aug. 1 from Acting Secretary Ross Cohen, who has been serving since the May departure of former Secretary Anthony C. “Tony” Woods. Bryan Sears/Maryland Matters.

 MARYLAND JOINS 24 OTHERS TO FIGHT TRUMP FOR EDUCATION FUNDS: Maryland joined 23 other states and the District of Columbia Monday in a lawsuit against the Trump administration, two weeks after the U.S. Department of Education abruptly froze $6.8 billion in funds for summer programs, adult learning and more. Alexander Castro/Maryland Matters.

 SUPREMES ALLOW TRUMP TO CUT U.S. ED DEPT PERSONNEL: The Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for the Trump administration to make deep cuts to U.S. Department of Education personnel after it lifted lower court injunctions that had blocked the cuts. In a dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the cuts — firing more than half the department’s staff — amounted to shutting down the agency by crippling its ability to do its job, a step that only Congress can take. She called the majority’s decision to lift the injunction “indefensible.” William Ford/Maryland Matters.

 KLAUSMEIER DISRUPTS ‘INDEPENDENT’ IG SELECTION PANEL: The process set up by Baltimore County Executive Kathy Klausmeier with the stated purpose of providing “independence” and “accountability” in the selection of a new inspector general has been thrown into turmoil, with a single member of the selection panel – and apparently Klausmeier herself – participating directly in the final round of candidate interviews. Mark Reutter/Baltimore Brew.

 * As the process to select Baltimore County’s next inspector general winds down, three unidentified candidates will undergo a final round of interviews, according to a statement posted on the county website. Natalie Jones/The Baltimore Sun.

 MARYLAND DEMS JOIN MAGA CALLS TO RELEASE EPSTEIN FILES: Democratic lawmakers from Maryland joined the growing call for the Department of Justice to release files related to the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, challenging President Donald Trump’s administration and aligning themselves with enraged MAGA Republicans who want to read them. Brenda Wintrode/The Baltimore Banner.

 COLUMN: JAMIE RASKIN SPEAKS OUT FOR FREE SPEECH: Jamie Raskin is an avatar of free speech. There was the Maryland congressman on MSNBC, trading insults with President Donald Trump, the most powerful man on the planet, as the House of Representatives pushed through his “One Big Beautiful Bill.” Rick Hutzell/The Baltimore Banner.

 FEDERAL DELEGATION HIGHLIGHTS B’MORE PROGRESS: Baltimore’s federal delegation gathered in City Hall Monday to highlight progress on some of the city’s longest-running struggles, such as lowered crime rates, fewer vacant properties and reductions in overdose deaths. But the successes were overshadowed by recognition that actions from the Trump administration could disrupt future progress in those areas. Danielle Brown/Maryland Matters.

 OPINION: VAN HOLLEN’s PROMOTION OF GREENBELT FOR FBI HQ A WASTE: There’s no polite way to say this anymore: Sen. Chris Van Hollen is wasting our time, wasting our money, and endangering sound federal planning by trying to block the FBI from moving into the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C. Carol Hughes/Direct Line Direct.

 BEN JEALOUS ON LEAVE FROM SIERRA CLUB POST: Ben Jealous, the former Maryland gubernatorial candidate turned Sierra Club executive director, is “on leave” from his post at the national environmental advocacy group. The move comes after significant turmoil during Jealous’ tenure, which began in early 2023. The Progressive Workers Union, which represents Sierra Club employees, has slammed Jealous for his management of the organization. Christine Condon/Maryland Matters.
