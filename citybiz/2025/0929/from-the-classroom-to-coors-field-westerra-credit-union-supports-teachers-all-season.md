# From The Classroom To Coors Field: Westerra Credit Union Supports Teachers All Season

Westerra Walks for Education Initiative Contributes $40,400 to Local Programs

 At the start of Major League Baseball’s 2025 season, Westerra Credit Union (Westerra) launched the “Westerra Walks for Education” program, which pledged $200 to local classrooms every time the Colorado Rockies reached first base on a walk. As of September 21, 2025, the Rockies had a total of 218 walks at Coors Field, totaling $43,600 that the credit union donated to local educational initiatives through its School Grant Program.

 The effort represents Westerra’s larger commitment to educators and its ongoing work with the Rockies. At the start of the season, fans joined the credit union to celebrate Julie Weathers as she threw the ceremonial first pitch at Coors Field during Teacher Appreciation Week. Weathers, who has been a teacher for 27 years, was selected by members of the community for her role as an all-star educator.

 “At Westerra, every decision is made right here in Colorado by people who understand our community,” said Nicole Andrushko, VP of Marketing. “Supporting educators isn’t just a priority for us – it’s part of our DNA. We’re proud to stand beside the teachers who inspire the next generation of leaders.”
