# October at The Schmidt Boca Raton History Museum

The Schmidt Boca Raton History Museum (SBRHM), home of the Boca Raton Historical Society, invites the community to explore history in two very different ways this October: a free, family-friendly craft activity as part of Free Fun Saturdays, and a thought-provoking evening lecture as part of the Town Hall Talk series celebrating the America250 initiative.

 Free Fun Saturday – “Design a Welcome Sign”

 Saturday, October 4, 2025 | 10 a.m. – 4 p.m. | Craft at 2 p.m. On the first Saturday of each month, the museum opens its doors free of charge to the public for Free Fun Saturdays. In October, kids and families will dream up their own creative welcome signs inspired by the historic Sanborn Square sign that greeted early visitors to Boca Raton. Admission is free all day, and the hands-on craft begins at 2 p.m.

 “Free Fun Saturdays are one of our favorite ways to engage children and families,” said Mary Csar, Executive Director of the Boca Raton Historical Society. “This October, we’re excited to let kids imagine how they would showcase Boca to the world.”

 Town Hall Talk – “The Continental Soldier: Washington’s Army in the Revolution”

 Wednesday, October 8, 2025 | 6 p.m. | Historic Town Hall As part of BRHS’s multi-year America250: The 14th Colony commemoration, acclaimed historian and reenactor Robert Feeney will present the second lecture in the fall Town Hall Talk series. This engaging program shines a spotlight on the ordinary men who transformed into extraordinary heroes while fighting for independence under George Washington’s command.

 “America250 invites us to take a thoughtful look at how our country came to be—and the people who shaped it along the way,” said Csar. “Through programs like our Town Hall Talks, we’re able to bring these important stories to life right here in Boca’s original Town Hall.”

 RSVP is required for Town Hall Talks. Seating is limited and available at www.BocaHistory.org.
