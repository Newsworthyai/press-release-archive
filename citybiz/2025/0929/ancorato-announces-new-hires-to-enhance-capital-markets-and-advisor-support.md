# Ancorato Announces New Hires to Enhance Capital Markets and Advisor Support

Ancorato, a third-party money manager specializing in innovative, objective-oriented, actively managed structured note strategies, announces the addition of several seasoned industry professionals who have joined their distribution team this year, including Patrick LeBlanc as vice president of capital markets, East; Andrew Burghardt as vice president of capital markets, West; and Thomas Monaghan as advisor concierge. In addition, Ancorato has partnered with industry veteran and ADISA President-Elect Joanna Venetch to assist with national accounts services.

 “We are excited to expand our capital markets and advisor support team with the addition of Patrick, Andrew, Thomas, and Joanna,” said Pisoot Senethavilay, president. “Together, they represent decades of experience in distribution, advisor support, and industry leadership. Their collective expertise reinforces our core commitment to providing advisors and their clients with exceptional service, trusted relationships, and an overall positive experience partnering with Ancorato.”

 In their roles as vice presidents of capital markets, Patrick LeBlanc (East) and Andrew Burghardt (West) will both work to build relationships with current and new financial advisors in an effort to expand access to Ancorato’s innovative strategies using structured notes, providing solution education and personalized support. LeBlanc will cover the Central and Eastern time zones, while Burghardt will cover the Pacific and Mountain time zones.

 LeBlanc brings 15 years of experience in alternative investments, real estate, and structured products, along with expertise in the independent broker-dealer (IBD) and registered investment advisor (RIA) channels. His background includes work with real estate investments across commercial, storage, and residential asset classes. LeBlanc earned his bachelor’s degree from Sam Houston State University.

 With more than 20 years of financial industry experience, Burghardt’s career has ranged from traditional investments to alternatives, such as private equity and venture capital. Prior to joining Ancorato, he served as head of West Coast distribution for an asset manager, where he specialized in building advisor relationships and expanding access to diverse investment opportunities. Burghardt graduated from Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania.

 As advisor concierge, Thomas Monaghan will help to streamline the advisor experience from initial onboarding through ongoing portfolio management. Monaghan will provide individualized direct reporting, portfolio position tracking, and one on one platform onboarding for StrategyLink, Ancorato’s advisor-friendly platform. StrategyLink connects directly with the advisor’s firm and custodian, eliminating the need for a second account, which is often required in traditional separately managed accounts. Monaghan is a skilled sales professional with a strong background in customer management and establishing client relationships. He graduated from Boise State University.

 Finally, we are fortunate enough to have industry veteran Joanna Venetch consulting with Ancorato regarding their national account efforts, bringing more than 22 years of experience in financial services to our table. In 2020, she founded Hana Solutions to support alternative investment firms as they navigate the independent broker-dealer and RIA landscape and is currently the president-elect of the Board of Directors of ADISA.
