# Building a Safer, More Connected Future: BIKE 5 Pedals Through Central Florida

Ninth annual BIKE 5 ride is a celebration of cycling, connection and community-driven change

 On Saturday, October 25, 2025, Central Florida cyclists will take to the streets and trails for Bike/Walk Central Florida’s ninth annual BIKE 5. BIKE 5 is more than an urban bike ride event. Its mission to create a safer, more connected region for people on bikes serves as a reminder of the broader need for a transportation network that prioritizes safety and accessibility. Participants become ambassadors for change by supporting mobility, equity, connected communities, and a thriving Central Florida.

 From leisurely riders to experienced cyclists, BIKE 5 offers ride options for everyone. Participants can choose from two distances. This year, the 10-mile BIKE 5 Main Streets Ride makes its debut and showcases vibrant local neighborhoods and business districts while strengthening community ties through cycling. This route brings to light how South Orlando and Downtown Orlando are connected through new, safe, cyclist-forward infrastructure. In just a span of 10 miles, riders will pedal through City District, Thornton Park, The Milk, Mills 50, Ivanhoe Village, and Audubon Park. This exciting new route to BIKE 5 highlights the overarching mission of showing the community that staying connected via a bicycle is possible through the many low-cost improvements that have been made in the past several years, with more improvement projects on the horizon.

This route, available both guided and self-guided, is designed to take riders through trails, slow neighborhood streets, and city connections that showcase what a bike-friendly region looks like. Whether a rider chooses BIKE 5 Cities or BIKE 5 Main Streets, each route offers a unique way to explore low-stress trails, scenic roadways, and the hidden gems of Central Florida.

 “BIKE 5 isn’t your typical cycling event,” said Anna Strasshofer, Events Manager at Bike/Walk Central Florida. “It’s not about racing or setting records. It’s about experiencing our cities at a casual pace, connecting with fellow riders in small groups, and learning how we can all help make Central Florida’s streets safer and more welcoming for people on bikes. This ride is a show of support for bike-friendly routes and real local living, where education, community, and mobility come together.”

 “The BIKE 5 route, both the 30-mile option and the new main streets ride, shows us how far we have come in creating connected, comfortable streets and trails that get us from City to City. We still have some work to do to truly create safe and accessible places for everyone, from 8 to 80, to ride, feel safe and enjoy,” said Emily Bush, Executive Director at Bike/Walk Central Florida. “The purpose of the event is not only to show people where they can comfortably ride, but to push for those connections and build a community that makes it easy for everyone to have access to active transportation options in their community.”

 This year’s BIKE 5 is made possible through continued collaboration with local governments, including a partnership with the City of Orlando, City of Winter Park, City of Maitland, Town of Eatonville, and City of Casselberry, whose investments in safer infrastructure and multimodal transportation are helping to improve cycling accessibility for both health and economic benefits.
