# Capital Square Named to Inc. 5000 List of Fastest-Growing Private Companies for Ninth Consecutive Year

Capital Square, one of the nation’s leading sponsors of tax-advantaged real estate investments and an active developer and manager of housing communities, has been named to the 2025 Inc. 5000 list of the nation’s fastest-growing private companies, marking the ninth consecutive year the firm has earned this recognition.

 “Capital Square is built on three pillars: Invest – the firm invests in tax-advantaged real estate. Build – we develop real estate in opportunity zones and elsewhere. Manage – we manage the firm’s assets. Each of these pillars contributes to the overall growth and success of the firm,” said Louis Rogers, founder and co-chief executive officer. “We are pleased that this growth has been recognized by Inc. for nine years in a row.”

 With a three-year growth rate of 54%, Capital Square ranked No. 4,918 on the 2025 Inc. 5000. The firm ranked 271 in Virginia and 118 in real estate nationally. Founded in 2012, Capital Square was first named to the Inc. 5000 in 2017.

 “It is a testament to the talent and dedication of the Capital Square team that we have earned a place on the Inc. 5000 list for nine consecutive years,” said Whitson Huffman, co-chief executive officer and chief investment officer. “Ranking among the top real estate firms nationally and as one of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S. highlights Capital Square’s strong position in a highly competitive industry.”

 Capital Square has expanded rapidly since its founding and has established multiple new divisions in recent years. In 2019, the company launched a development arm that has since delivered 979 mixed-use apartment units and is currently building or planning 1,020 additional units. Many of these projects are located within qualified opportunity zones, positioning Capital Square as one of the nation’s most active sponsors of qualified opportunity zone funds. The firm’s development projects include Otis, CoStar’s 2024 Multifamily Development of the Year, and Maeve, recipient of ENR Texas & Southeast’s 2025 Award of Merit in Residential/Hospitality. The firm additionally launched Capital Square Living in 2023, a wholly owned subsidiary, to manage the firm’s growing multifamily portfolio of over 40 apartment communities across the Southeast. Capital Square Living was recognized as one of Multi-Housing News’ Top Multifamily Property Management Companies of 2024, ranking No. 71 nationwide in only its second year of business.
