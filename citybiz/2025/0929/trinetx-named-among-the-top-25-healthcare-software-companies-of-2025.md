TriNetX, the company behind the world’s broadest federated network of real-world data (RWD) and evidence, has been named one of the Top 25 Healthcare Software Companies of 2025 by The Healthcare Technology Report. This prestigious recognition celebrates TriNetX’s rapid growth, pioneering software solutions, and transformative contributions to life sciences and healthcare.

 “This recognition reflects the vision we’ve pursued relentlessly: powering innovation across the healthcare ecosystem through data, intelligence, and technology,” said Steve Kundrot, Chief Operating Officer, TriNetX. “By bringing together a global, privacy-compliant network of real-world data with cutting-edge AI and analytics, we’re not only solving today’s clinical research challenges, but we’re also building the foundation for the next generation of precision, representativeness, and speed in drug development.”

 TriNetX LIVE, the company’s flagship platform, integrates de-identified patient data from over 300 million patients across 200+ healthcare organizations and 8,800+ sites around the world.

In 2025, TriNetX continues to push boundaries by introducing next-generation features that simplify workflows, improve collaboration, and make data more intuitive to use. The platform’s forthcoming integration of large language models (LLMs) promises to transform how researchers query EHRs, making access to clinical insights as simple as asking a question.
