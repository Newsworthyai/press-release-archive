# Q&amp;A with Ian Frederick, Trade Commissioner of ProChile in Los Angeles

San Francisco will host the Chile Tech Tour 2025 from October 6–10, where Chile’s top innovators will connect with Bay Area investors and tech leaders during San Francisco Tech Week. The delegation will spotlight ClimaTech and AgriTech startups pitching to leading VCs, accelerators, and innovation funds.

 Ian Frederick, Trade Commissioner of ProChile in Los Angeles will be in San Francisco to discuss the companies and why Chile is emerging as a serious player in the global startup scene.

 The Chile Tech Tour is more than a trade mission — it is a strategic bridge between Latin America and the world.

 What is the vision behind the Chile Tech Tour 2025, and why was San Francisco chosen as the host city?

 The vision of the Chile Tech Tour 2025 is to position Chile as a rising global hub for technology and innovation, while creating direct bridges between Chilean founders and U.S. investors, partners, and media. San Francisco was chosen because it is the heart of the global innovation economy—home to Silicon Valley, venture capital, and world-changing companies. For Chilean startups, San Francisco offers unparalleled exposure to the investors, accelerators, and thought leaders shaping the future of technology, so our program for the week includes a dozen meetings with leading climate funds and specialized VC’s in climate tech projects.

 How does this tour connect with San Francisco Tech Week and the broader innovation ecosystem in the Bay Area?

 The Chile Tech Tour aligns with San Francisco Tech Week by bringing a delegation of high-growth international startups to the Bay Area at a time when the entire tech community is gathered. It’s a natural synergy: San Francisco Tech Week highlights global trends in AI, sustainability, and future industries—exactly where Chilean startups are excelling. Our Chile Tech Tour is hosting two activities as part of the official SF Tech Week program: a discussion panel encounter, “Chile and California: Bridging AI and Innovation,” on October 9th, and a networking Meet-up, “Latam Hubs Happy Hour.” By embedding Chile’s innovation ecosystem into the Bay Area’s flagship tech moment, we’re accelerating opportunities for collaboration, investment, and cross-border growth.

 Can you highlight some of the Chilean startups participating—what sectors are they in, and what makes them stand out?

 This year’s delegation showcases 27 companies spanning:

 * Clean Energy & Climate Tech (Instacrops, Climatech Chile members) – developing data-driven solutions for agriculture and sustainable resource management.
* Health & Biotech (Medible, Pegasi) – pioneering platforms in health innovation and wearable technology.
* Smart Cities & AI (Rocketbot, Ninja Excel, Youtouch) – bringing automation, AI, and data visualization tools that scale globally.
* Food & Lifestyle Tech (Chef Legion, MUUD) – innovating at the intersection of wellness and digital experience.

 What sets them apart is their ability to build scalable solutions for global challenges—climate resilience, accessible healthcare, automation—and their readiness to expand into the U.S. market.

 How were these companies selected to represent Chile in such a competitive global setting?

 The delegation was curated by ProChile in collaboration with leading Chilean tech associations. Companies were selected through a competitive process that evaluated scalability, international readiness, innovation, and alignment with global market demands. These startups represent the best of Chile’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, with proven traction in Latin America and clear pathways to growth in the U.S.

 What specific advantages does Chile offer founders: talent pool, market access, funding, and government support?

 Chile is uniquely positioned as Latin America’s innovation sandbox:

 * Talent Pool: A highly educated, bilingual workforce with strong expertise in engineering, data science, and design.
* Market Access: Chile serves as a gateway to Latin America, with access to over 3 billion consumers through free trade agreements.
* Funding & Ecosystem: Programs like Start-Up Chile—one of the world’s top accelerators—have built a robust pipeline of founders.
* Government Support: Consistent pro-innovation policies, infrastructure investment, and incentives for R&D and foreign collaboration.

 This combination makes Chile an ideal launchpad for founders aiming to scale globally.

 What’s the single biggest message you want tech leaders to take away?

 That Chile is not just a resource economy—it’s an innovation economy. Our founders are building world-class solutions in AI, sustainability, health, and smart cities that are ready to integrate with global markets. The Chile Tech Tour is an invitation for U.S. tech leaders to co-create the future with Chilean innovators, driving growth and impact on both sides of the hemisphere.
