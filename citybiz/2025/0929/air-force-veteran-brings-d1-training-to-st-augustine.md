# Air Force Veteran Brings D1 Training to St. Augustine

D1 Training, a leading fitness enrichment concept utilizing the five core tenets of athletic-based training, will be opening a new location in St. Augustine at 35 Summerlin Lane on October 13. The new group fitness facility employs a sports-science backed training regimen led by certified trainers to help people of all ages achieve their sport and fitness goals.

 In celebration of the new location’s launch, St. Augustine neighbors and residents are encouraged to stop by and meet the facility’s team at its grand opening event, on November 8, which will feature a ribbon-cutting ceremony.

 Chris Sieburg will join a roster of impressive existing franchisees, including former professional and collegiate athletes. Additional D1 partners include NBA star Chris Paul and Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow.

 An Air Force veteran, Sieburg has lived all over the world but has called St. Augustine home for more than 20 years. After retiring early from his role as Executive Vice President of Operations for a distribution company, he began thinking about how to combine his passion for entrepreneurship and fitness. A firm believer in the power of positive support systems at every age, Sieburg came across D1 Training and knew he wanted to bring the concept to St. Augustine as a valuable resource for the community.

 “So much growth can happen when we take on challenges, but having a supportive and motivating environment makes those challenges easier to face,” said Sieburg. “The D1 St. Augustine team is here to be that support system and help athletes grow through every challenge and stage of their sports and fitness journeys.”

 D1 Training offers four age-based programs including Rookie (ages 7-11), Developmental (ages 12-14), Prep (ages 15-18) and D1 Adult. Each fitness program is based on the five athletic-based tenets: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down. Outside of group workouts, D1 Training offers group, semi-private, and one-on-one training with world-class coaches. The goal is simple: to continue to train athletes who are dedicated to their sport or fitness goals, regardless of age, or athletic background.

 “Chris is the ideal candidates to bring the D1 Training experience to St. Augustine,” said the brand’s Chief Operating Officer, Dan Murphy. “We’re thrilled to welcome him to the D1 family and are confident in his ability to show the St. Augustine area what they’ve been missing out on. D1 is a one-of-a-kind fitness experience that’s built around the individual and meant to help people meet their athletic goals. Our strong network of franchisees embodies our core values to bring the D1 Training vision to life, and we know Chris will do just that in St. Augustine and its surrounding communities.”

 Strategically expanding across the nation through franchising, D1 Training has more than 150 facilities open with over 100 additional locations in various stages of development. The brand is currently seeking financially qualified business builders, former athletes, and entrepreneurs, who share a passion for fitness and youth sports, who are ready to make a positive impact on their community.
