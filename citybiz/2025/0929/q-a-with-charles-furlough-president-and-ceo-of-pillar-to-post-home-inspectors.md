# Q&amp;A with Charles Furlough, President and CEO of Pillar To Post Home Inspectors

Charles Furlough’s career began in his family’s heating and electrical business, where he gained invaluable hands-on experience. In 1997, he ventured into the emerging field of home inspections as a franchise business owner at a then-smaller Pillar To Post, quickly recognizing the potential for growth and innovation. Over the next two decades, he grew Pillar To Post from a small franchise network into North America’s largest home inspection company.

 The housing market has faced plenty of headwinds recently, yet home inspection businesses like Pillar To Post are growing. What do you think this says about the state of the market and consumer demand right now?

 Even in a cooling market, people still need homes and every one of those transactions requires confidence and clarity. What we’re seeing is that inspections are becoming more critical, not less, because buyers and sellers can’t afford surprises in this kind of environment. Our growth reflects the strong relationships we’ve built with the real estate community, who understand the value a thorough, professional inspection brings to their clients. It’s that trust and consistency that allows us to keep expanding, even when the overall market slows.

 You’ve spent most of your career with Pillar To Post, moving from franchise business owner to CEO. How has that perspective shaped the way you lead the company through today’s economic uncertainty?

 I know firsthand what it feels like to be on the ground as a franchise business owner, balancing operations, marketing, and client service all at once. That experience keeps me focused on practical solutions that help our owners thrive, even when the market is unpredictable. At the corporate level, every decision is filtered through the lens of, “How will this help a local business owner succeed tomorrow?” For me, that comes down to three constants: delivering an exceptional brand experience, keeping sales and marketing strong, and making sure owners can meet capacity when demand is there. Those priorities never change, even in uncertain times, because there are still plenty of homes being sold, and it’s our job to make sure our franchisees are positioned to serve them well.

 Many people are rethinking traditional career paths and choosing to “hire themselves.” Why do you think franchising, and home inspections in particular, resonate with professionals at this moment?

 There’s been a shift in values: people want autonomy, ownership, and control over their futures. Franchising offers that independence without the isolation of starting completely from scratch. Home inspections resonate because it’s a service that’s always in demand, tied to one of the biggest financial and emotional decisions people make. It’s also a field where professionalism and trust stand out, which attracts people who want to build something lasting. Our mission of ensuring confident home ownership speaks volumes and the need to help others through this process is really special.

 Pillar To Post uses what you call the Executive Model. Can you explain what that means in practice, and why it’s proving attractive to entrepreneurs from such diverse backgrounds?

 The Executive Model is about building a business, not just buying yourself a job. It’s designed to be scalable, with systems and support in place so owners can grow at their own pace. In practice, it means low overhead, a lean team, and the ability to focus on leadership and relationship-building rather than being stuck in every task. That flexibility is appealing to people from corporate careers, the military, and beyond who want both independence and growth potential.

 How has Pillar To Post managed 10 consecutive quarters of market share growth even while the overall real estate market slowed?

 We’ve been disciplined about staying focused on fundamentals: quality inspections, strong agent relationships, and consistent client service. At the same time, we’ve invested heavily in technology, like our new Pillar To Post HomePage platform, to deliver value in ways the industry hasn’t seen before. That combination has helped our owners capture more business per agent, even when overall transactions were down. Market share growth in a down market is the clearest sign that we’re doing something right.

 What advice would you give to professionals, whether from corporate backgrounds, the military, or real estate, who are exploring entrepreneurship for the first time?

 Be clear about why you want to own a business and what kind of life you’re trying to build. Franchising can be a great path, but it still requires commitment, persistence, and the willingness to put in the work early on. Lean on the systems and support, but don’t expect shortcuts. Your effort will determine your success. If you go in with the right mindset, it can be one of the most rewarding moves you’ll ever make.

 Looking ahead, how do you see technology, changing workforce values, and market conditions shaping the next chapter of franchising in the home services space?

 Technology will keep raising expectations. Clients and agents want seamless, transparent experiences, and the brands that deliver that will stand apart. Workforce values are also changing, with more people prioritizing autonomy and flexibility, which makes the franchise model especially relevant. Market conditions will always fluctuate, but services tied to essential needs, like housing, tend to endure. The next chapter belongs to brands that innovate, support their owners, and adapt quickly to how people want to work and live.
