# BayFirst Financial Announces Exit from SBA 7(a) Business and $103 Million Loan Sale

BayFirst Financial Corp., parent company of BayFirst National Bank today announced plans to exit the SBA 7a lending business and sell $103 million of SBA 7(a) loan balances to Banesco USA.

 “As we announced earlier in the year, Management and the Board initiated a comprehensive strategic review aimed at derisking SBA 7(a) balances on the balance sheet and positioning the Company for long-term growth and enhanced shareholder value,” stated Thomas G. Zernick, Chief Executive Officer. “Today marks a significant milestone in our efforts. BayFirst has signed a definitive agreement to sell $103 million in SBA 7(a) loans to Banesco USA. In conjunction with this agreement, BayFirst will exit the SBA 7(a) lending business, and the majority of our current SBA lending staff and support teams will be offered positions with Banesco USA. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of this year.

 “The loans will be sold at 97% of retained balances and Banesco USA will assume servicing of these loans. Furthermore, Banesco USA will also purchase for book value the servicing rights associated with the purchased loans and will conduct servicing for all SBA loans that BayFirst will continue to own. While we are transitioning away from SBA 7(a) lending, I am pleased that our highly experienced team will continue to support SBA lending at Banesco USA.”

 “We remain deeply committed to our community bank mission – serving individuals, families, and small businesses with stable checking and savings products that contribute to a more predictable, low-cost funding base. This relationship driven approach continues to strengthen our presence across the vibrant Tampa Bay region and creates opportunities to expand our community bank portfolio, deposit growth, and fee income sources like treasury management services.”

 Banesco USA is an independent, Florida state-chartered bank with over $5 billion in assets with eight locations across South Florida and Puerto Rico. Banesco USA distinguishes itself in providing personalized customer service and a suite of products and services to domestic and international clients. In addition to this latest investment that will establish a nationwide SBA lending platform, the bank is poised to continue its growth trajectory fueled by its investments in the Commercial & Industrial (C&I), Business and Professional (B&P), International, and Commercial Real Estate (CRE) lines of business.

 “Through the addition of BayFirst’s SBA lending team and the acquisition of a portfolio of SBA 7(a) loans, Banesco USA gains the infrastructure, expertise, and enhanced capabilities to deliver SBA lending on a national scale,” said Calixto (Cali) Garcia-Velez, President & CEO of Banesco USA. “As a business bank, we recognize that small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and this transaction aligns with our growth strategy to expand our small business lending capabilities. By acquiring this SBA 7(a) lending business and its experienced team of SBA lending professionals, we are also establishing a presence in the Greater Tampa Bay region while positioning Banesco USA to serve more small and mid-size companies across Florida and nationally.”
