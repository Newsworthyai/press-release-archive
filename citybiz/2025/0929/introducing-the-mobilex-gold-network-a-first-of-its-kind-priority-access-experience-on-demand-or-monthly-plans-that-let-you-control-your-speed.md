# Introducing the MobileX Gold Network: A First-of-Its-Kind Priority Access Experience — On-Demand or Monthly Plans That Let You Control Your Speed

MobileX, the most customizable wireless service designed to save consumers money, today announced the upcoming launch of the MobileX Gold Network, which will provide customers with new controls over their mobile experience through priority high-speed network access available exactly when needed. The Gold Network will be available October 18.

 The Gold Network is designed to deliver faster speeds and lower latency during times of network congestion in busy areas. Customers can choose Gold On Demand for a one-time high-speed boost at a concert or sporting event, or select Gold Unlimited or Gold Build Your Own for continuous monthly priority data access where they live, work or play. While most customers do not require priority data, MobileX realizes that many experience network congestion in their daily lives. The Gold Network provides flexibility and customizable options, all on one of the fastest 5G networks in America.

 “For too long, carriers have dictated how customers access performance on their networks,” said Peter Adderton, founder and CEO of MobileX. “With the Gold Network, we are putting that choice back in the customer’s hands. They can instantly upgrade to priority access when they want it, or simply rely on our regular high-speed data for all other times.”

 This higher priority helps connections perform better during peak network congestion in crowded areas, delivering smoother streaming, more reliable video chat, and a more responsive experience.

 Gold Network Options:

 * Gold On Demand – Gold Network access will be available at any time for just $2.10 per GB, while regular high-speed data will be just $1.90 per GB (reduced from $2.10 per GB)
* Gold Unlimited 10 – 10GB of priority high-speed data for $19.88/month*
* Gold Unlimited 30 – 30GB of priority high-speed data for $29.88/month*
* Gold Build Your Own – Customized plans starting at $4.08 per month* for Gold Network access and $3.88 per month* (reduced from $4.08/month) for regular high-speed data

 The MobileX Gold Network will be available next month via the MobileX app, in XtraOptions. New customers can get started by downloading the MobileX app from the Apple App Store and Google Play, or by purchasing a MobileX SIM starter pack at more than 3,700 Walmart stores and on Walmart.com.
