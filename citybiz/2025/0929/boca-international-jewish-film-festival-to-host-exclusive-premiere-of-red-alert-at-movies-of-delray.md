# Boca International Jewish Film Festival To Host Exclusive Premiere Of Red Alert at Movies of Delray

The Boca International Jewish Film Festival will present a powerful special event with the Palm Beach County premiere of Red Alert on Saturday, October 25, 2025, at 7:00 p.m. at Movies of Delray (7421 W. Atlantic Avenue).

 Created, written, and directed by acclaimed filmmaker Lior Chefetz (The Stronghold), Red Alert portrays the largest and deadliest massacre in Israel’s history, when more than 1,200 civilians were murdered and 250 kidnapped near the Gaza border. Drawing from true accounts of survivors, the limited series weaves courageous, deeply personal stories into a cinematic narrative of terror, resilience, and heroism.

 The evening will feature:

 * Nati Dinnar – Founder & CEO of IZZY and Founder & President of the Israel Entertainment Fund (IEF)
* Lior Chefetz – Writer & Director of Red Alert
* Bat Sheva Yahalomi – Survivor and real-life inspiration for one of the series’ most moving storylines

 Following the screening of the first episode, guests will be invited to a conversation with Dinnar, Chefetz, and Yahalomi about the making of the series, its global reach, and the urgency of sharing Israeli stories at this moment in history. A second episode will be screened immediately after the discussion.

 “Red Alert tells the story of ordinary people who became heroes in extraordinary circumstances,” said Lesley Rich, Festival Co-Founder. “We are honored to bring this timely, moving series to Palm Beach County audiences and to spotlight the voices behind it.”

 This premiere event also marks the kick-off of the Boca International Community IEF, a new local partnership between the Boca International Jewish Film Festival and the Israel Entertainment Fund. Modeled after the national IEF partnership with Jewish National Fund-USA (JNF-USA), the Boca chapter aims to strengthen support for Israeli storytelling and expand the global reach of projects like Red Alert.

 Red Alert was co-created with Ruth Efroni, co-written by Kineret Peled and Idan Hubel, and produced by Green Productions (Golda) in partnership with Bender Brown Productions (Roswell), with support from the Jewish National Fund-USA Israel Entertainment Fund (IEF) for Keshet 12.

 The limited series will be available to stream beginning October 7, 2025, on Paramount+, but this event offers an exclusive chance to see it on the big screen and meet those who lived and created the story.
