# Thompson Thrift to Build 300-Unit Luxury Apartment Community Near Atlanta

Thompson Thrift, a full-service nationally recognized real estate company and one of the nation’s leading multifamily developers, today announced that it will develop Autry at Tulip Grove, a luxury 300-unit community in the Atlanta suburb of Buford. Thompson Thrift expects to welcome the first residents in January 2027.

 “Gwinnett County is one of the most dynamic growth markets in the Southeast, with a thriving population, strong economy and exceptional employment rates,” said Josh Purvis, managing partner for Thompson Thrift Residential. “Autry at Tulip Grove is designed to offer residents a seamless blend of style, comfort and connectivity, with amenities and finishes that create a place residents are proud to call home.”

 Located at 1325 Laurel Crossing Pkwy NE, the 10-acre community will feature thoughtfully designed, four-story, elevator-serviced buildings offering spacious one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartment homes. In line with Thompson Thrift’s commitment to delivering high-quality homes with in-demand features and amenities, each residence will include premium interior finishes such as elegant quartz countertops, stainless-steel appliances, smooth glass-top ranges, timeless tile backsplash, designer fixtures and finishes and hardwood-style flooring. Residents will also enjoy large walk-in closets, walk-in showers, patio and balcony options, private yard options, detached garages, full-size washers and dryers, high-speed internet access, an Amazon package hub, and more.

 Resort-style living will continue throughout the community and will feature two fully equipped fitness centers with 24-hour access, a heated swimming pool, electric vehicle charging stations, thoughtfully designed courtyards, an outdoor pavilion with a gas fireplace and seating, community grilling areas, outdoor game area, golf simulator, dog park, pet spa with grooming stations, billiards and shuffleboard, and a 24-hour social hub.

 Situated adjacent to The Exchange, a 100-acre master planned development, future residents will have quick access to a wide variety of retail, entertainment and restaurant options, some of which include Sprouts Farmers Market, Pickle and Social, Andretti Indoor Karting & Games and TopGolf. Nearby access to Interstate 85 will offer convenient connectivity to downtown Lawrenceville, downtown Atlanta, Mall of Georgia and Sugarloaf Mills.

 Autry at Tulip Grove is strategically positioned in one of Atlanta’s strongest suburban markets. In just a three-mile radius of the community, the population has grown 31.9% over the last 15 years, outpacing both Gwinnett County and the Atlanta MSA as a whole. Within Gwinnett County, 97% percent of the total workforce is currently employed, and the average household income is $114,000.

 Major employers of the area include Publix Distribution & Manufacturing, Primerica, and Northside Hospital, which is underway on a 17-floor tower expansion that is slated for completion in 2026 and will generate an additional 5,000 jobs. Rowen, a 2,000-acre mixed-use development that could ultimately create 100,000 jobs once completed, is just 2.5 miles from the development.
