Pursuant to the Brokered Offering, the Company sold 32,000,000 units of the Company (each, a “Unit“) at a price of C$0.50 per Unit (the “Offering Price“).

 Further to the Company’s press release dated September 15, 2025, the Company has also completed its non-brokered private placement (the “Non-Brokered Offering“, and collectively with the Brokered Offering, the “Offerings“) for gross proceeds of C$5,500,000 from the sale of 11,000,000 Units at the Offering Price. The Company raised aggregate gross proceeds of C$21,500,000 from the sale of 43,000,000 Units at the Offering Price under the Offerings. The Underwriters also acted as finders for the Company in connection with the Non-Brokered Offering.

 José García, President and CEO of Silver X, stated:

 “This is an extremely important milestone for Silver X. We are thrilled with the strength of investor demand that led to not one, but two upsizing’s of this C$21.5 million financing. This is a critical moment in the Company’s trajectory, and we thank all our shareholders for their continued support in sharing our vision of building the next district-scale silver project in Peru.”

 “This financing represents more than just capital – it is the catalyst for transformative growth. For the first time in the Company’s history, we have the financial strength required to execute our vision properly and decisively. The injection of capital will allow us to significantly advance our growth plans across exploration, resource conversion, and production scale. Silver X now has the potential to become one of the fastest-growing silver producers in South America, with the foundations in place to deliver sustainable value and operational excellence.”

 Each Unit consists of one (1) common share of the Company (each, a “Common Share“) and one-half (1/2) Common Share purchase warrant (each, a “Warrant“). Each whole Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Common Share (each, a “Warrant Share“) at a price of C$0.70 at any time on or before September 29, 2028.

 The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering for capital and exploration expenditures related to the Company’s operations in the Nueva Recuperada Silver District in Peru as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes.
