# Marco’s Pizza Recognized Among QSR Magazine’s Best Franchise Deals for 2025

Marco’s Pizza, one of the nation’s fastest-growing pizza brands, announces it has been recognized by QSR magazine, the authority on the quick-service and fast-casual restaurant industry, as one of its “16 Best Franchise Deals for 2025.”

 Published by WTWH Media, this annual ranking has been identifying standout brands since 2011, making it one of the industry’s most established and credible franchise opportunity reports. The Best Franchise Deals feature has become a go-to guide for entrepreneurs and investors looking to enter or expand within the quick-service and fast-casual category. Selection is based on a range of criteria including franchise costs, growth potential, operator support, and brand differentiation.

 “Franchise opportunities are more competitive than ever, and the brands that stand out are those that combine innovation, support, and financial upside,” said Danny Klein, Vice President, Food, Retail, Hospitality Editorial Director at QSR Magazine. “Our Best Franchise Deals list for 2025 shines a spotlight on companies like Marco’s, which represent some of the most exciting opportunities in the marketplace right now.”

 Marco’s inclusion underscores its strong franchisee support system, operational model, commitment to quality and innovation, and consistent sales performance as reported in its Franchise Disclosure Document. With more than 1,200 locations and ambitious growth plans, the brand continues to build momentum in an increasingly competitive market.

 “We are honored to be named among QSR’s Best Franchise Deals for 2025,” said Gerardo Flores, Chief Development Officer of Marco’s Pizza. “This recognition validates our franchise model and the dedication of our operators nationwide. As we continue to scale, our focus remains on supporting our franchise owners with innovative technology, operational excellence, and growth-forward programs.”

 This recognition builds on Marco’s recent win of FRANdata’s 2025 TopScore FUND Award in the food category, which underscores the brand’s commitment to franchisee growth and greater access to financing.

 Looking ahead, Marco’s is focusing on strategic multi-unit expansion in the Midwest, East Coast, and Sun Belt, as well as growth in non-traditional venues and the international market. Prospects are taking note of the business opportunity, as Marco’s Franchise Disclosure Document reports $1.3M AUV for the top 25% of franchised stores in 2024.*

 To further support brand growth and franchise expansion, Marco’s recently launched a Franchise Development Royalty Incentive Program designed to reduce barriers for qualified multi-unit owners. With early-stage royalty incentives starting at 0%**, plus real estate, construction, and operations support, the brand offers a streamlined, resource-rich path to growth. Existing franchisees continue to grow with the brand, with 65% of 2024 franchise agreements awarded to existing franchisees.

 Methodology

 QSR magazine’s Best Franchise Deals for 2025 were selected from a nomination process that ran from mid-May to mid-June. Finalists were reviewed by the Franchise Council, which selected their top choices from shared information and FDD data. Their top choices comprise the final list. Brands cannot appear for back-to-back years, but can return after a year off. In addition, the program recognizes rising franchisors on the outside looking in, and features a Hall of Fame category for concepts that have been included several times.
