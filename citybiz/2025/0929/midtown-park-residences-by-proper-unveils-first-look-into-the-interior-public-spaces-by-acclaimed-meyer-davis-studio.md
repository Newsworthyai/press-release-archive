# Midtown Park Residences by Proper Unveils First Look Into the Interior Public Spaces by Acclaimed Meyer Davis Studio

Rosso Development, Midtown Development, and Proper Hospitality have unveiled the design of the public space interiors at Midtown Park Residences by Proper, offering a glimpse into the design vision that will define the landmark luxury residential tower in the heart of Midtown Miami.

 Set within the transformative $2 billion Midtown Park master-planned community, the 28-story tower is the first residential building to debut within the project, delivering 288 residences surrounded by activated parks, curated retail, gourmet restaurants, cafes and an ULTRA racquet and padel club. At the core of the project’s public space interiors is acclaimed New York–based design studio led by Will Meyer and Gray Davis, Meyer Davis, who have crafted spaces that embody Proper Hospitality’s distinct sensibility: sophisticated, layered, and deeply connected to place.

 “We envisioned a dynamic connection between the city and home to create a thoughtful living experience throughout the communal areas that reflects the area’s energy and character,” said Will Meyer, Co-Founder of Meyer Davis Studio. “The result is a timeless environment that feels both purposeful and inviting, where every space reflects a careful balance of comfort, functionality, and true sense of place.”

 The public space’s design for Midtown Park Residences by Proper draws on Miami’s natural light and landscape while aligning with the project’s broader vision of community and lifestyle. Meyer Davis conceived interiors that blend elegance with warmth, moving seamlessly from open, social settings to more tranquil retreats. Natural stone, warm wood, plaster finishes, and touches of greenery anchor the design palette, while sculptural furnishings and artful accents bring Proper’s signature sense of individuality. Communal areas such as the double-height lobby gallery, spa, and resident lounges have been designed with the fluidity of hospitality spaces in mind.

 “Midtown Park Residences by Proper is about creating a lifestyle and sense of community that extends beyond the walls of each home,” said Carlos Rosso, Founder and CEO of Rosso Development. “Every space has been designed to inspire connection, wellness, and a true enjoyment of Miami living, with elevated design that reflects a meticulous attention to detail in every corner of the project.”

 The residential experience begins with a dramatic 16-foot-high lobby gallery that artfully bridges with the vibrant energy of Midtown’s streetscape, showcasing a collection of museum-quality art. Meyer Davis layered the space with travertine and flagstone floors that echo Miami’s natural language, offset by polished surfaces and mirrored bronze columns that bring depth and contrast. Seating areas transition from intimate library nooks and custom banquettes to plush velvet and mohair lounge chairs paired with stone tables, while green mosaic-lined planters draw the landscape indoors and sculptural pieces punctuate the space as focal points—seamlessly weaving art, culture, and design into daily residential life.

 A 40,000 square foot tropical pool deck with a signature restaurant and bar overlooks panoramic skyline and water views. Wellness offerings include a state-of-the-art fitness center, dedicated Pilates studio, tranquil yoga and meditation garden, two private pickleball courts, and a spa pool. Owners will also enjoy curated social areas including a gourmet coffee bar, an events lounge, a private party room, a kids club, virtual golf simulator and screening room, co-working space, and a communal vegetable garden designed by Naturalficial.

 Located at 3055 N Miami Avenue, Midtown Park Residences by Proper is steps from the Miami Design District and Wynwood, positioned at the center of the city’s most connected neighborhood. Sales are exclusively handled by Fortune Development Sales. For more information or to schedule a private appointment at the sales gallery, please visit midtownparkbyproper.com or call 305-9-PROPER.
