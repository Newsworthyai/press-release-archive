# Top Producers Jaclyn Bild and Sari Shapiro Launch The J&amp;S Group at Douglas Elliman

Powerhouse real estate agents Jaclyn Bild Smith and Sari Libbin Shapiro have officially joined forces to launch the J&S Group at Douglas Elliman. With a combined career sales volume of $900+ million, the industry-leading cousins are uniting their shared roots, proven track records, and expansive networks to establish one of South Florida’s most dynamic and influential new teams. The J&S Group specializes in property sales across South Miami, Coral Gables, Coconut Grove, Miami Beach, Edgewater and North Bay Village, providing clients with personalized access and expert guidance in the region’s most sought-after luxury markets.

 “Jaclyn and Sari’s partnership is rooted in family and fueled by proven success,” said Jay Phillip Parker, CEO of Brokerage, Florida Region and President of Douglas Elliman Development Marketing, Florida. “Their new team reflects both their history of achievement and a clear vision for the future—one that blends local insight with global reach. We are proud to support their growth and look forward to the impact the J&S Group will make within Douglas Elliman and the entire South Florida market.”

 Bild and Shapiro have been individually ranked among the top 1.5% of real estate professionals nationwide by RealTrends + Tom Ferry America’s Best List as featured in The Wall Street Journal annually since 2022. They have consistently earned the prestigious Pinnacle Award for placing in the Top 3% at Douglas Elliman. The launch of the J&S Group marks a milestone as the duo celebrates ten years at Douglas Elliman, evolving from individual top producers into one family-driven team. Both born and raised in Miami, and guided by the philosophy “The Luxury of Local,” Bild and Shapiro are setting out to create a legacy built on local expertise and community-driven excellence.

 “The luxury of local means giving our clients a competitive advantage that only true Miami natives can provide,” said Shapiro. “Being born and raised here, we are privileged to understand this city and its neighborhoods on a deeper level. That perspective allows us to guide our clients with insight and authenticity that can’t be replicated.”

 “The launch of the J&S Group is about building something lasting and giving our clients the confidence, clarity, and seamless experience they deserve,” said Bild. “Our vision is to create a legacy defined by integrity, strategy, and a true passion to exceed expectations in everything we do.”

 Bild brings to the J&S Group a wealth of experience shaped by her early exposure to her family’s real estate business and her professional foundation in finance. After earning dual degrees in Finance and Marketing from Washington University in St. Louis, she began her career in New York City, advising high-net-worth individuals before returning to Miami in 2015 to pursue real estate full time. With her sharp market insight, strong financial background, and fluency in both English and Spanish, she has become a trusted advisor to local and international clients. Her career is distinguished by recognition in Douglas Elliman’s 2024 Ellie Awards, where she ranked #13 in GCI, #24 nationally and #15 in Florida and is recognized as the #10 Latin Agent Nationwide by Sales Volume by NAHREP.

 Shapiro has built her career through deep market knowledge, an expansive influential network, and an impressive track record in both luxury resales and pre-construction. Since entering real estate in 2015, she has played a pivotal role in the selling of some of Miami’s most iconic new developments, including Mr. C Residences Coconut Grove and VILLA MIAMI in Edgewater. Sari brings valuable experience from Douglas Elliman’s Sports & Entertainment Division, where she has successfully worked with professional athletes including several NBA players. Leveraging dual degrees in Marketing and Psychology from the University of Miami, she combines strategic insight, innovative marketing and an intuitive understanding of her clients’ needs. Known for her approachable charisma, discretion, dedication and white-glove service, she has consistently ranked as a top producer nationally. In 2023, she was recognized by Douglas Elliman as the #4 Agent in Transactions, the #8 Agent in Florida, and ranked #10 nationally by Sales Volume.

 Together as the J&S Group, Bild and Shapiro bring unmatched expertise, complementary strengths, and a shared passion for Miami to global clients across the luxury market. They have sold more resales than any other agent at Mr. C Residences Coconut Grove since the building’s opening last summer, a testament to their market dominance and trusted reputation. Their deep community ties, combined with their professional success, make them uniquely positioned to deliver exceptional results and shape a new legacy within Douglas Elliman.
