# Q&amp;A with Chad Roffers, Co-Founder and CEO of Concierge Auctions

Chad Roffers is the Co-founder and CEO of Concierge Auctions, the world’s leading luxury real estate auction house. As a tech entrepreneur turned real estate innovator, Chad has built his career at the intersection of business development, technology, and high-end property sales. His clients include billionaires, Hall of Fame athletes, and global investors seeking exclusivity, speed, and certainty in real estate transactions.

 With an MBA from the University of Denver, Chad started his formative professional years in Silicon Valley at AdAuction.com, where he worked alongside the founding team of eBay and saw firsthand the disruptive potential of auctions. This experience sparked his vision to bring that same transparency and efficiency to real estate.

 Chad went on to become a top-producing agent, co-founded SKY Sotheby’s International Realty, and launched Pulse Realty Software—acquired by Lone Wolf Technologies—before co-founding Concierge Auctions in 2008. Under his leadership, the firm has conducted auctions in 46 U.S. states and 35 countries, broken world records for the highest-priced homes sold at auction, and built the largest global database of ultra-high-net-worth buyers and sellers.

 Chad is also known for his philanthropic leadership through Concierge Auctions’ Key For Key® giving program with Giveback Homes, which has funded hundreds of homes for families in need.

 Can you give us a brief overview of Concierge Auctions and your role as CEO?

 Concierge Auctions is the world’s largest luxury real estate auction firm and backed by Sotheby’s, the oldest and most esteemed auction house founded in 1744, along with Anywhere Real Estate, a residential real estate brokerage that offers the largest global agent network. We own one of the most comprehensive and intelligent databases of high-net-worth real estate buyers and sellers in the industry. As CEO, my role is to steer our global strategy, cultivate relationships with key stakeholders, and continue innovating how high-end real estate is bought and sold. My passion lies in bringing transparency and liquidity to the luxury space—and doing so with speed and certainty.

 What differentiates Concierge Auctions from traditional real estate sales?

 Unlike traditional sales alone, where properties can sit on the market upwards of years, luxury real estate auctions create a defined timeline, driving urgency and competition among buyers. As we tool to the traditional model, this method removes the uncertainty of traditional negotiations and ensures that sellers receive market-driven results within a set timeframe. A well-executed auction strategy combines global marketing reach, an exclusive network of ultra-high-net-worth buyers, and a time-certain sale to generate interest. By carefully curating the right audience and leveraging a competitive bidding environment, we ensure that each auction achieves market value.

 What do most people misunderstand about luxury real estate auctions?

 The biggest misconception is that auctions are a last resort. In reality, they’re a strategic choice for motivated sellers who value time. Our sellers aren’t distressed—they’re discerning. Auctions eliminate the guesswork by creating a clear timeline and letting the market set the price. It’s a model that gives control back to the seller and generates competition among pre-qualified buyers.

 How do you view the current consumer behavior and the future of luxury real estate?

 The dynamic has flipped. It used to be that industries led innovation and consumers followed. Now, consumers are demanding better tools and more efficient processes, and the real estate industry is among them. Companies that adapt quickly will win. In times of economic uncertainty, auctions become an even more attractive option, offering sellers time-certain liquidity and buyers the opportunity to acquire premier properties at market-driven pricing. Understanding these shifts allows us to position auctions as a strategic tool, no matter the market cycle.

 

How has Concierge Auctions leveraged technology to scale globally?

 Our technology has completely transformed the auction landscape, making it more accessible and efficient than ever before. With our online platform, buyers can participate from anywhere in the world, creating a truly global marketplace. Virtual bidding not only expands the pool of potential buyers, but also adds a layer of transparency and convenience that drives competition. Moreover, data is one of the most powerful tools in modern luxury real estate. By analyzing buyer behavior, market trends, and historical auction performance, we can tailor strategies to maximize outreach and engagement, ultimately leading to increased bidding activity. Real-time analytics allow us to adjust marketing efforts and position properties for the strongest possible outcome. It is critical to work with a team who understands the importance of KPIs in order to be able to pivot quickly when necessary—is digital engagement meeting expectations? Is the property experiencing strong foot traffic? These are fundamentals everyone should know.

 You work closely with high-net-worth individuals around the world. What do they value most in a real estate transaction?

 Ultra-high-net-worth clients aren’t just buying homes—they’re investing in lifestyle, privacy, and exclusivity. Their goals vary, but motivations like portfolio diversification, legacy planning, or speed often overlap. That’s why we position auctions as strategic tools, not just sales methods. By removing contingencies and setting a definitive close date, we offer speed

 and certainty—two things they value highly. Global buyers also expect a frictionless experience, especially when purchasing across borders. Every market has unique legal and tax nuances, so partnering with local experts and top listing agents is key. Whether it’s private showings by helicopter or Concierge-level service, our goal is to eliminate friction and build confidence in every transaction.

 Looking back at your career, is there a particular sale or moment that best represents your philosophy as a leader and entrepreneur?

 The sale of ‘The One’, America’s largest residence, in Bel Air, California set a world record. It was more than just a record-breaking auction; it was a testament to the power of global reach, strategic urgency, and collaboration at the highest level. We marketed to over 170 countries, generated 200,000+ website views, and engaged top-tier agents and bidders from around the world—all in just 55 days. That moment reaffirmed my belief that when innovation, precision marketing, and trusted partnerships align, we can unlock extraordinary outcomes that traditional methods alone simply can’t achieve.

 Culture and talent are vital to company success. How do you engage and inspire your workforce?

 Our business is fast-paced and high-pressure, which naturally attracts top-tier talent. We’re consistently facilitating multimillion-dollar transactions for some of the wealthiest clients in the world. To further inspire, we created our Key For Key® giving program in partnership with Giveback Homes to fund new homes for families in need every time we sell a property. Team members participate directly in building these homes on site and meeting the families who receive them—it’s deeply motivating and keeps our purpose front and center.

 As a leader, how do you balance success with stability in a rapidly evolving market?

 Success in luxury real estate isn’t just about sales—it’s about vision, resilience, and adaptability. The most effective leaders in this space are those who think long-term, prioritize relationships over transactions, and consistently deliver value beyond the deal. It’s about setting a standard of excellence that others aspire to follow. The luxury market is constantly shifting—economic trends, buyer preferences, and technology are always evolving. The key to staying ahead is not only embracing change, but driving it, rather than resisting it. Whether it’s integrating data-driven strategies, leveraging new marketing platforms, or rethinking how we present properties, innovation is what keeps us relevant and ahead of the competition. Great leaders don’t just close deals—they build teams that consistently outperform. That means fostering a culture of accountability, investing in professional development, and ensuring everyone is aligned with a shared vision. The strongest teams aren’t just skilled; they’re motivated, collaborative, and driven by a common purpose.

 What keeps you up at night as a CEO in such a fast-moving space?

 Complacency. That’s the enemy. The moment you get comfortable, you’re at risk. I’ve always believed in maintaining a healthy level of paranoia—not fear, but awareness. Real estate and tech are both evolving fast, and we have to evolve even faster.

 What advice would you give to aspiring real estate professionals who want to work in the ultra-luxury market?

 Build trust. Be authentic, informed, and solutions-oriented. Differentiate yourself with a clear value proposition, and stay agile. This market rewards adaptability. For agents looking to break into luxury real estate, start with education and relationships. Network with the right people—sellers, agents, and auction experts. Align yourself with a reputable brokerage and auction firm to learn how the process works. The more value you bring to the table, the faster you’ll gain credibility. Understand that auctions aren’t a last resort, they’re a proactive strategy and are a tool alongside the traditional real estate model. In hot markets, they consolidate demand; in slower ones, they create urgency. Success comes from identifying the right properties, educating sellers, and executing with precision. Avoid common mistakes like mispricing or poor timing; data and strategy are everything.
