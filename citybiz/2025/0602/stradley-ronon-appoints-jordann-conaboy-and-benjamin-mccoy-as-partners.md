# Stradley Ronon Appoints Jordann Conaboy and Benjamin McCoy as Partners

Increasing the firm’s capabilities to serve clients in litigation and investigations, Stradley Ronon welcomes Jordann Conaboy and Benjamin McCoy as partners in the firm’s Philadelphia office. Both were previously partners at Fox Rothschild and Jordann most recently was an assistant U.S. attorney in the District of New Jersey. They have previously teamed up to lead large-scale cases throughout the United States, and they will continue to represent clients in complex litigation, investigations and white collar matters nationwide, with an emphasis on health care, managed care, pharmaceutical and commercial disputes.

 “Stradley Ronon has a deep bench of talented health care and managed care litigators who can handle the gamut of disputes, with Jordann and Ben building on that strength by providing both defense and affirmative litigation services related to fraud claims,” said Jeff Grossman, co-chair of the firm’s litigation practice. “Their combined experience in managed care claims disputes, fraud, RICO claims and government — including the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services — investigations significantly enhances our ability to guide clients through increasingly complex regulatory and litigation challenges across these sectors.”

 Over the last decade, Ben and Jordann have been at the forefront of some of the most significant legal issues relating to health care, managed care and pharmaceuticals. They have collectively obtained judgments and settlements for hundreds of millions of dollars in fraud cases, and they have successfully defended clients facing substantial exposure before state and federal judges, juries and arbitrators in more than a dozen states. While some of their most significant matters have involved health care and managed care disputes, they have also represented clients in a wide range of other commercial cases, investigations and government actions.

 During his time as an assistant U.S. attorney, Jordann prosecuted criminal cases and handled affirmative civil enforcement matters involving health care fraud and corporate violations relating to opioids and prescription drugs. He handled some of the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s and the Department of Justice’s largest and most complex cases in the health care and pharmaceutical spaces, some of which involved hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in losses and potential penalties. Jordann received multiple recognitions for his service, including the 2024 Federal Law Enforcement Prosecutor of the Year Award and the 2023 U.S. Attorney’s Award for Superior Performance in Affirmative Civil Enforcement.

 Ben has also represented health insurers and plan administrators in affirmative civil suits targeting large-scale health care fraud operations, including those involving sober living homes, pass-through billing and COVID-19 testing fraud — similar to the types of cases that Jordann handled from a different angle for the government. Ben has also successfully defended the same entities and other Fortune 500 companies in business and regulatory disputes across the country.

 Ben and Jordann’s arrival and their complementary experiences will help build on the firm’s recent growth in litigation, as well as in the health care, managed care, white collar and insurance spaces. That growth includes a five-lawyer insurance/reinsurance litigation team in New York and Washington, D.C., who joined Stradley Ronon earlier this year.
