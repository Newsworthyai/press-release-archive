 What are your three best pieces of career advice for the next generation of young leaders?

 1. Take the risk and go for it. The outcome notwithstanding, you win by absorbing the experience of actually pursuing the path of a dream. By committing to the advancement of an idea, one will quickly find themselves invested, both emotionally and psychologically. Once those feelings become anchored, you’ll develop the energy and vision needed to navigate the unknown.
2. You have the answers, you are just too scared to say them. So often people are apprehensive about speaking their mind and, instead, become too deferential to the “experts.” It’s imperative to look inwardly and develop self belief. This type of mindset will serve you well as it both enhances confidence and sets the right tone.
3. Trust your gut, your gut knows all. The ability to become reliant on your instincts will, no doubt, prove invaluable. When times get tough, and there’s a cacophony of “noise” from stakeholders and alike, it is critical to listen to your inner voice and, importantly, trust it.

 How do you effectively manage multiple ventures and, moreover, how do these ventures complement your existing business portfolio?

 I have an excellent team that owns their respective roles for the various ventures I’ve initiated. We constantly communicate and strategically improvise. It’s worth noting that several members of that team are comprised of family members. That level of intimacy creates an almost heightened sense of dependability. We are a tightly integrated bunch and have a shared passion for achieving set objectives.

 The enterprises which I have launched complement the existing business portfolio in that they are decidedly diverse in nature. They are all very different. But learning different industries allows me to take different aspects of each business and utilize them in the others ventures so we can maintain a creative edge. Intellectually speaking, our team enjoys casting a wide net and gaining visibility to new industries. It keeps things fresh and interesting. We believe we can take our collective experience and, in most if not all cases, bring about positive outcomes in most any related business.

 Knowing how loaded the term “success” is, how do you currently find fulfillment in your career path at this stage of your life and what importance does the work/life integration hold for you?

 The fulfillment comes from bringing things to life and helping others achieve their respective dreams. My job has, over time, shifted into being the “Everyman success translator.” If individuals can discover real value by learning my story, namely the lessons learned aspect, I find that notion immensely satisfying. My story is a relatable one, and one which has resonated greatly I believe. I derive a real sense of joy knowing that my guidance/experience has been influential to others. Leaving your mark upon another is, for obvious reasons, a very uplifting feeling and one which continues to drive me to do even more and broaden that impact.

 

After your initial book, what advice might you have for budding authors?

 Follow your instinct and be bold. The writing style, the cover, the format…all of that was my own creation. While there were plenty of publishing houses who expressed interest, and day’s end my comfort level was more aligned with my can do nature. I know how to make big ideas happen, I’ve done that, so I figured that a book project would require a similar sort of formula, and I was right.

 Our world is saturated with business based content, much of it I find quite fascinating I might add. That said, I set out to craft a book which would be more hard hitting and, frankly, “told it how it is.” I believe we need a certain dose of reality to be prepared for a business venture, warts and all.

 Ultimately, what sort of legacy do you want to leave behind?

 That I followed my dreams and never gave up. I want to be an example for my kids on how focus and an unwavering spirit can accomplish anything. I want my grandchildren to say “that dude went for it.” Life is finite, that’s well understood, so maximizing my time in the here and now is paramount to my existence. I try not to take each day for granted and thereby savor the experience, despite whether or not that day presents a series of challenges or not.

 What is something that we don’t know about you but should?

 I’m good at art. Several years ago I began to nurture the artistic ingredient, something which I believed always existed yet just never had an opportunity to shine really. I’ve discovered that through the creation of art you can really access a different side of one’s self. It’s been revelatory in that respect, so I continue to tug at that thread.
