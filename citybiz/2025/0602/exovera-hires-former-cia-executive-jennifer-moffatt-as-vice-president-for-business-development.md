VIENNA, Va.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Exovera announced that it hired Jennifer Moffatt as Vice President for Business Development. She joins the company after retiring from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as the Chief of Strategic Partnerships at the Open Source Enterprise.

 exoINSIGHTTM, Exovera’s Digital Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (D-ISR) system, is used to collect and analyze open source information in disconnected environments. It applies artificial intelligence to facilitate early indications and warnings, enable research across large data sets, and support full-spectrum information operations.

 “Throughout my decades of experience in government, I have not encountered a commercial capability quite like exoINSIGHT,” said Moffatt. “Exovera excels at effectively integrating large-scale data collection and analysis in the most hard-to-reach data environments to accelerate informed decision-making.”

 During her time at the CIA, Moffatt led enterprise-wide outreach and engagement with foreign partners, private industry, academia, and intelligence community stakeholders in support of mission. She has served worldwide for three CIA directorates overseas and in the Washington, D.C. area, focusing on open source intelligence and counterterrorism.
