# Q&amp;A with Patty Hayward, General Manager of Healthcare and Life Sciences at Talkdesk: How Contact Centers Can Drive VBC

Patty Hayward is the General Manager of Healthcare and Life Sciences at Talkdesk, where she leads the strategy and execution across product, go-to-market, and strategic partnerships. With 25+ years of experience at the intersection of technology, care delivery, and health system operations – including leadership roles at McKesson, Aetna, and Humedica – Hayward brings a unique blend of clinical, technical, and business expertise to the evolving healthcare landscape.

 At Talkdesk, Hayward has pioneered the integration of contact center technology with EHR systems, including the industry’s first AI-native integration with Epic Cheers. She is helping shift healthcare contact centers from cost centers to value centers by orchestrating AI agents, automating patient interactions, and improving access and navigation at scale. Her work focuses on enabling health systems to accelerate digital transformation and deliver more coordinated, personalized, and proactive care experiences.

 A recognized thought leader, Hayward has been instrumental in reimagining how both vendors and healthcare organizations can co-innovate with core systems like the EHR to deliver seamless omnichannel experiences rather than building disconnected digital silos. She is a trusted executive advisor to both providers and life sciences companies looking to scale patient support, streamline operations, and meet new consumer expectations around access, affordability, and empathy.

 Hayward is passionate about using AI responsibly to improve outcomes and lower barriers to care, especially for vulnerable populations. Her work focuses on advancing equity, driving automation with guardrails, and ensuring that digital transformation doesn’t leave the human touch behind.

 Many providers are hesitant to fully embrace value-based care. What’s holding them back?

 One of the biggest barriers is the financial risk. Underperforming in a VBC contract can mean repaying funds to insurers or facing penalties from CMS. According to an HFMA survey, 61% of organizations cited reluctance to assume downside risk as a major factor in avoiding VBC. The stakes are high, and many providers don’t feel fully equipped to manage the shift.

 What role does data – or the lack of it – play in VBC success or failure?

 Data gaps are a major hurdle. While providers have access to EHRs, it’s not just about having data – it’s about surfacing the right insights at the right time. If clinicians or support teams can’t identify care gaps during patient interactions, they miss crucial opportunities to improve outcomes and meet contract benchmarks.

 How can modernizing the contact center help providers perform better in value-based contracts?

 Historically seen as cost centers, contact centers are now critical engagement tools. With AI-enabled platforms, staff can identify care gaps in real time – even during routine calls like billing or appointment scheduling. This turns every interaction into a chance to improve patient outcomes and VBC performance.

 Isn’t upgrading contact centers costly and disruptive?

 Not necessarily. Purpose-built healthcare CX solutions integrate with existing EHRs and workflows, so agents don’t need to learn new systems. Modern platforms also support automation and self-service, which streamline routine tasks and free up agents to focus on high-impact patient needs.

 What’s the long-term value of transforming the contact center?

 A proactive, AI-enabled contact center improves care coordination, reduces costs, and drives better patient outcomes. By consistently identifying and addressing care gaps across all touchpoints, providers can boost their VBC performance and unlock additional revenue – all while delivering more personalized, accessible care.
