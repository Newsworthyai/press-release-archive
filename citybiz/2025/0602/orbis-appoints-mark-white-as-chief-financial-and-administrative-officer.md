# Orbis Appoints Mark White as Chief Financial and Administrative Officer

Orbis is pleased to announce that today Mark White has joined the organization as the new Chief Financial and Administrative Officer (CFAO).

 Mark joins Orbis from Alight (formerly the American Refugee Committee), where he served as Chief Financial Officer for more than 12 years. He dedicated nearly 16 years to the organization’s mission of supporting refugees and displaced people across more than 20 countries.

 Previously, Mark was Chief Operating Officer for Habitat for Humanity Australia (based in Sydney), supporting the CEO and other senior leaders on matters related to strategic planning, finance, human resources, compliance, and information systems.

 Before that, he held leadership positions with Habitat for Humanity International, including serving as Director of Business Strategy Development for the Asia Pacific office (based in Bangkok, Thailand) and as Finance Manager for the Africa & Middle East office (based in Pretoria, South Africa).

 “With a 25-year career in the international NGO space, Mark brings extensive experience working across global teams and a proven track record of excellence in financial and administrative leadership,” says Orbis CEO Diana Wheeler. “As a leader, he cares about fostering collaboration, communication, and opportunities for mentorship and development. We are thrilled to welcome him to the Orbis team.”

Mark was inspired to join Orbis after having laser eye surgery to correct a torn retina incurred while playing sports.

 “Having worked in international development for so long, I am acutely aware how fortunate I am to have easy access to high-quality medical and eye care,” he says. “Orbis’s mission to build strong and sustainable eye care systems globally that put treatment and prevention within reach deeply resonates with me, especially after that situation.”

 Mark holds a Master of Science in taxation from DePaul University in Chicago and a B.A. in accounting from Fort Lewis College in Colorado. In 2023, he was named CFO of the Year in the large nonprofit category by the Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal.
