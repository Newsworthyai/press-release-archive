JLL announced today that it has represented media agency Canvas Worldwide in a new 68,301-square-foot office lease at 2330 Utah Avenue in El Segundo, California.

 “Over the past decade, Canvas has grown into a national force in media by challenging conventions and unlocking bold solutions for our clients,” said Paul Woolmington, CEO of Canvas Worldwide. “Our new El Segundo headquarters is more than just a larger space. It’s a reflection of our momentum, our culture of innovation, and our investment in the future of our people and our clients.

 “As a creative company, it’s essential that we identified a space for Canvas Worldwide that is a unique building, with unique design elements that represents their culture, fosters collaboration, and accommodates its growth” said Fine. “2330 Utah Avenue is one-of-a-kind project designed by Frank Gehry offering 24-foot ceilings, large windows and, skylights that flood the space with natural light, efficient floor plate, and private outdoor space This also speaks to the fact that El Segundo is very much attractive for media and creative tenants.”

 Searles went on to say “In today’s economy, companies are looking for a premier building with abundant amenities in a location easily accessible by its employees. This is the perfect building for Canvas Worldwide to attract and retain the best people and continuing its standing as one of the best places to work.”

 “With a growing community of media and innovation-driven firms, our city provides the environment and inspiration for companies to thrive,” said El Segundo Mayor Chris Pimentel. “Canvas Worldwide’s expansion into a distinctive, collaborative space reflects both their vision and our city’s status as a hub for cutting-edge creativity.
