# Q&amp;A with Landon Cooley, Co-Founder &amp; CEO of Pest Share

Landon Cooley is the CEO & Co-Founder of Pest Share, a pest control amenity platform designed for property managers and their residents. He is also the CEO of Pestcom Pest Management, a reputable pest management company based in Boise, ID. Landon has 17 years of experience in pest management and is fourth generation in his family to pursue a career within the industry. He has had consistent success through strategic partnerships, innovation, and creating contagious company cultures.

 Landon’s career has been fueled by a belief that there is “always a better way.” This passion has led him to his most recent venture, Pest Share, a powerful software as a service with a deep domain expertise in pest control. Through software and innovation, Pest Share is taking a costly expense and transforming it into a revenue generating amenity. This in turn puts more money in the pockets of property managers, while enhancing their resident’s experience.

 Landon and his team are determined to enhance the property management experience while innovating the pest control industry. They passionately believe that Pest Share is the future of pest control in the property management space.

 Pest Share just closed its $28 million Series A funding round. How would you describe the company’s evolution since 2020?

 Pest control has always been a pain point with property managers, and they were just waiting for a solution tailored to their needs. As we came to the market in 2020 with that tailored solution, we found immediate traction and a big opportunity. With this momentum we have built a nationwide business that is expanding into all ends of the residential property management industry.

 Our latest $28 million Series A funding round marked another chapter in our journey – one where we are widely recognized as the category-defining company. We believe our innovative method of delivering pest control services will become standard across professionally managed rental housing in the near future.

 How is Pest Share transforming pest control for the residential property management industry? How is Pest Share creating value for property managers?

 Pest Share is completely transforming pest control for the residential property management industry, including the single-family and multifamily rental markets. Our tech-centric business model automates pest control service dispatch and connects residents with a national network of high-quality, vetted service providers. This can be used as a standalone solution for property managers or can be offered as an amenity for residents.

 Our platform helps property managers elevate the resident experience and delivers a seamless method for residents to resolve pest issues. We enable property managers to reduce operational headaches related to pest control, improve overall service quality and unlock new revenue streams.

 Technology is a rapidly changing landscape. How is Pest Share positioning itself to stay relevant as competitors begin to emerge in the industry?

 Pest Share is a first-of-its-kind business model for the pest control industry. When you completely redefine how a service is delivered to the market, many competitors are likely to follow. Justin, Tom and I aren’t just tech founders trying to disrupt a legacy industry. We bring decades of deep pest management expertise and generations of knowledge in this sector. We have won the business of hundreds of property managers, both big and small, because of our ability to completely solve the problem through tech integrations, drive outstanding resident experiences, and deliver NOI to the bottom line.

 Our deep understanding of the sector and our national network of providers will continue to be key differentiators in the experience that we provide to property managers and residents. Additionally, we’re leveraging modern AI technology to deliver a faster, more automated experience for residents, provide deeper and more seamless integrations for property managers, and build strategic partnerships with major industry leaders.

 What’s your approach to building high-performing teams across the company?

 At Pest Share, it all starts with finding people who are “our flavor.” There are many great company cultures out there, but ours is unique and distinct. Once we find the right people, everything is built on transparency and accountability. We want every team member to understand our vision, know both our short- and long-term goals, and see exactly how they can make an impact.

 From there, we create clear accountability, assign responsibility, and then get out of their way! As co-founders, we take pride in surrounding ourselves with people who are smarter and more capable than us. By building teams with this kind of talent and aligning them around a single, unified goal, we’ve been able to achieve fantastic results

 How many customers does Pest Share have? What real estate companies are you currently working with?

 Pest Share services over 300,000 residential units in 48 states via the platform. We are currently working with over 700 property management companies across the country, from local operators that have 200 units to large national brands with over 50,000 doors, and we work with companies like Re/Max, Roofstock and ARK Homes For Rent.

 What’s next for Pest Share?

 Following our Series A, we will use the capital to fuel continuous growth in the single-family and multifamily rental markets. We plan to invest in product development, expand GTM initiatives and develop strategic integrations and partnerships with other leading industry softwares.
