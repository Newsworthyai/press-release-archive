# Project for Public Spaces Selects Detroit as Host City and Downtown Detroit Partnership as Co-Host for the 5th International Placemaking Conference

Project for Public Spaces announced today that Detroit has been selected as the host city for the 5th International Placemaking Conference taking place June 24-26, 2026. Downtown Detroit Partnership will be the conference co-host. ‍A global gathering of over 500 public space professionals from around the world – including urban planners and designers, public officials, place managers and researchers – Placemaking Week emphasizes hands-on learning and innovative social events, while leaving behind a public space legacy in host cities. Embracing a wide variety of sectors and disciplines, the event creates a dynamic forum for attendees to develop and share concrete strategies to advance placemaking both locally and globally.

 Detroit has faced some of the toughest urban challenges – economic decline, depopulation, vacancy and even bankruptcy – but has emerged with remarkable resilience and momentum. The theme for this year’s conference, From Recovery to Resilience through Placemaking, serves as a powerful reminder of the transformative influence of community-powered spaces that can help cities meet the many challenges of our world today. As communities everywhere face the growing struggles of maintaining and enhancing social life in the public realm, this global gathering will serve as a catalyst for innovative, inclusive and adaptive placemaking.

 “We’re thrilled to bring together placemakers from all around the world to take learn from Detroit’s groundbreaking placemaking efforts, which are real-life demonstrations of the power of public space to change the story of an entire city,” said Nate Storring, co-executive director for Project for Public Spaces. “Detroit is a city where Project for Public Spaces has deep roots and active collaborations, from Campus Martius Park to the Joe Louis Greenway. We’re looking forward to working with our longtime partners at Downtown Detroit Partnership to showcase how placemaking can tackle the big challenges our communities face today.”

 “We’re honored to host next year’s Placemaking Week in Detroit and grateful for the opportunity to showcase the momentum and impact of the work being led by the Downtown Detroit Partnership and our fellow partners across downtown and the city,” said David Cowan, chief public spaces officer at the Downtown Detroit Partnership. “This is a unique chance to highlight how collaboration between the public and private sectors is transforming public spaces and strengthening community connections. We’re excited to welcome the global placemaking community to experience Detroit’s energy, creativity and progress firsthand.”

 Detroit exemplifies the transformative power of placemaking, turning once-neglected areas into thriving community spaces through grassroots innovation, public-private collaboration, and cultural investment. Landmark projects such as Campus Martius Park, named by USA Today the “No. 1 Public Square in America,” showcase how strategic urban revitalization can drive civic pride and economic resurgence. The Joe Louis Greenway – a 27.5-mile multi-use trail connecting over 23 neighborhoods – demonstrates Detroit’s commitment to mobility and neighborhood connectivity. Historic sites like Michigan Central Station have been reimagined as vibrant civic spaces, blending adaptive reuse with community activation. Meanwhile, Belle Isle, a 982-acre island park, offers residents and visitors alike a vast natural retreat within the city. Together, these spaces and many others highlight Detroit’s resilience and innovative spirit, making it a model for community-led urban transformation.

 “Detroit and Michigan know the power of placemaking to grow connections, create vibrant neighborhoods, and bring people together,” said Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. “That’s why we’re proud to host leaders and innovators from around the world in Detroit for International Placemaking Week 2026. We’ve made historic investments to grow Michigan’s economy, revitalize our communities and make our state the best place to live, work and play. Let’s keep working together and helping more people ‘make it’ in Michigan.”

 “From our beautiful international riverfront to our vibrant downtown to our new neighborhood Arts Alleys, Detroit has embraced the importance of placemaking to every community,” said Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan. “We are proud to partner with the Downtown Detroit Partnership to host Placemaking week this year and look forward to showing off our best examples as we learn from our guests from other great cities.”

 Project for Public Spaces and Downtown Detroit Partnership invite all placemakers to stay tuned for more details on the upcoming call for proposals opening in October 2025, registration in the new year, and more details on how to prepare for a three-day adventure exploring the best of placemaking in Detroit!
