# Bring Ocean-Inspired Art to the Kitchen with the New Guy Harvey x Hedley &amp; Bennett Essential Apron

A portion of proceeds from sales benefit ocean conservation

 Guy Harvey, Inc. and Hedley & Bennett, a Los Angeles-based culinary lifestyle brand known for premium aprons and kitchen gear, have partnered to launch a new apron featuring iconic artwork by world-renowned artist, conservationist and scientist Dr. Guy Harvey. As with all Guy Harvey merchandise and artwork, a portion of proceeds from sales benefits ocean conservation and marine science education through the Guy Harvey Foundation (GHF).

 “We’re thrilled to bring together Guy Harvey’s art and the art of cooking through this collaboration with our new partners Hedley & Bennett,” said Alex Harvey, licensing and marketing director for Guy Harvey, Inc. “This apron is stylish and durable and can certainly spark conversations about ocean conservation.”

 The Guy Harvey x Hedley & Bennett essential apron is now available online at HedleyandBennett.com and select retailers and priced at $120. Whether it’s grilling the catch of the day or plating the perfect dish, this apron is built for the job. Featuring Guy Harvey’s iconic archived scribble fish print, consisting of a marlin, sailfish, swordfish, tuna and mahi, it brings the spirit of the open water straight into the kitchen. Made from durable 100% cotton chino twill with optic white webbing, a pop of tomato red at the ampersand, and a co-branded label, it’s tough enough for dock duty yet refined enough for dinner service.

Built to last, painted to inspire.”

 Dr. Harvey has built an apparel, accessories and lifestyle brand featuring his authentic marine wildlife art with the purpose of emphasizing the importance of sustainable marine initiatives and education. The art is a reflection of his experiences and tells a story about the life of the marine life or animal portrayed. A portion of proceeds from all officially licensed Guy Harvey products supports the Guy Harvey Foundation, which funds scientific research and develops cutting-edge educational programs to inspire the next generation of ocean stewards.

 About Guy Harvey: Guy Harvey is a unique blend of artist, scientist, diver, angler, conservationist, explorer and entrepreneur, fiercely devoted to his family and his love of the sea. His childhood passion for the ocean and its living creatures not only inspired him to draw but fueled a burning interest that prompted a formal education in marine science. Having graduated with honors in Marine Biology from Aberdeen University in Scotland in 1977, Guy returned home to Jamaica to resume his education, earning his Ph.D. from the University of the West Indies in 1984. Though he gave up a budding career as a marine biologist for that of a highly acclaimed artist, Guy has continued his relentless pursuit to unravel the mysteries of the sea, traveling the world to better understand the habits and habitats of the marine wildlife he paints. Guy is a recipient of the Simon Combes Award, and has been inducted into the Fishing, SCUBA Diving and Swimming Halls of Fame. The Guy Harvey coastal lifestyle brand brings the undersea world into everyday life through its merchandise offering including apparel, art, home goods and gift items that all help benefit marine conservation through the research and education work of the Guy Harvey Foundation.

 About the Guy Harvey Foundation: With a focused mission to better understand and conserve the ocean environment, the Guy Harvey Foundation (GHF) collaborates with local, national and international organizations to conduct scientific research and provides funding to affiliated researchers who share this objective. The GHF also develops and hosts cutting-edge educational programs that help educators to foster the next era of marine conservationists, ensuring that future generations can enjoy and benefit from a properly balanced ocean ecosystem. www.GuyHarveyFoundation.org

 About Hedley & Bennett: Hedley & Bennett started in a three Michelin-star restaurant kitchen by Ellen Bennett in 2012 out of the need for something better; an apron developed hand in hand with insanely talented, obsessive chefs (with a ton of fancy food awards). Relentlessly refined to be not just an apron, but the perfect companion to any cooking adventure—be it service for 200 or dinner for two.
