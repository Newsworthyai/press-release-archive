The more members we have, the more transformative grants we can award to local organizations making a difference in education, arts, health, family, and the environment.”

 Guests will enjoy cocktails, hors d’oeuvres, networking, and a special program highlighting the success stories of past grantees and the vision for the year ahead from the original founders.

 Since its founding, Impact 100 PBC has awarded millions of dollars in multiple $100,000 grants, empowering nonprofits to transform lives and strengthen the community.
