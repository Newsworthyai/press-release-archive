# Intention.ly Unveils Custom Client Portal and Mobile App to Elevate Client Experience

Intention.ly, the leading growth engine for financial services firms, today announced the launch of its custom-built client portal, now available online and via iOS and Android. The new platform represents the latest step forward in the growth consultancy’s ongoing mission to set the client experience standard for firms supporting financial services organizations.

 Building upon an existing foundation of transparency, accountability, and collaboration, Intention.ly has developed a complete web-based and mobile-friendly environment consolidating everything partner firms need to manage their relationship in one streamlined platform.

 The new portal and mobile app give clients instant access to:

 * Intention.ly created content, brand templates, and media assets
* Strategy documents and campaign plans
* Performance reports and dashboards
* Messaging frameworks and guidelines
* Project plans and timelines
* Account updates and announcements

 Clients can also communicate directly with their dedicated Intention.ly team members through the portal and mobile app.

 “Our clients always tell us we feel like an extension of their internal team,” said Kelly Waltrich, CEO and co-founder of Intention.ly. “That’s a privileged role we take very seriously. The new portal reflects our commitment to acting as their true growth partner, giving them greater transparency into the work we’re doing together, opening up more opportunities for collaboration, and ensuring their experience with Intention.ly is as impactful as possible.”

 The launch comes as Intention.ly continues to expand its solutions to bring more value to financial services firms, including the recently announced AI Lab and the growing Operations and Technology offering. For more information, visit intention.ly.
