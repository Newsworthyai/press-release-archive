Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii, a renowned coffee franchise recognized for its premium Hawaiian coffees, strong community connections, and adventurous spirit, will open its newest location in Madison, New Jersey on September 30th. Located at 14 Lincoln Place, the new location will offer handcrafted coffees with a kick, branded merchandise, and a craveable food menu with a Hawaiian twist.

 As New Jersey natives with a strong background in business, father-son duo Jim and Tyler Bowman are excited to introduce Bad Ass Coffee to Madison. Jim is a seasoned entrepreneur who previously owned and sold several technology companies, as well as a 7-Eleven franchise in the 1980s. Now stepping back into franchising, he is eager to assist his son in expanding Bad Ass Coffee in New Jersey. Tyler looks to leverage his nearly two decades of expertise in the entertainment and hospitality industry to make Bad Ass Coffee the go-to place for premium coffees. Together, they have signed a multi-unit deal and plan to open at least 6 additional Bad Ass Coffee locations across New Jersey, starting with the Madison café.

 “As lifelong New Jerseyans, we’re excited to bring something bold and different to Madison with Bad Ass Coffee,” said Tyler Bowman. “This isn’t just about serving coffee, it’s about creating an energetic, welcoming space where the community can come together. Madison is just the start, and we can’t wait to grow and share this experience across the state.”

 In addition to premium Hawaiian coffees, Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii serves up a full menu of popular blended drinks, signature lattes, cold brews, teas and innovative foods with a Hawaiian twist. Guests can enjoy an island-inspired experience with nods to Bad Ass Coffee’s Hawaiian roots, savoring signature offerings in a comfortable space. Those looking to take the taste of Hawaii home can purchase packages of Hawaiian blends and single-origin coffee beans including 100% Kona, single serve pods and flavored coffee, along with a variety of playful branded merchandise.

 We’re very excited to become an active member of the Madison, NJ community and fortunate to have such experienced and committed franchise partners in Jim & Tyler Bowman to bring a new premium Hawaiian coffee experience to life in Madison,” said Scott Snyder, CEO of Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii. With the new location in the center of the transportation hub, there will be no better way to “make it a badass day” than by starting that day at Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii.”

 Guests are invited to join ‘Ohana Rewards, Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii’s loyalty program. New ‘Ohana Rewards members will receive $5 off and 89 Lei (points) after their first purchase as a member. A two-day grand opening celebration will be held in the weeks after opening, where guests can enjoy giveaways, games, and of course, coffee. There will also be a giveback initiative with a charity partner at the event.

 Born on the Big Island of Hawaii in 1989, Bad Ass Coffee was founded on the dream of sharing American-grown, premium Hawaiian coffee with people everywhere. The brand invites guests to embrace their adventurous spirit, with its coffee beans sourced from the famous Kona region of the Big Island, Kauai and Maui. Its name pays tribute to Hawaiian coffee history – donkeys could often be heard bellowing as they carried precious loads of coffee beans down the steep mountains of the Big Island. The people of Kona named these hard-working donkeys the “Bad Ass Ones” because of their reliably strong, but stubborn nature in carrying their cargo.

 The legend of those stubborn donkeys lives on today at Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii, a company that is uncompromising when it comes to sourcing, roasting, and serving quality Hawaiian coffee with the Aloha spirit.

 Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii – Madison is open daily from 6 a.m. – 6 p.m. For more information on Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii in Madison, please visit https://badasscoffee.com/, or call (973) 520 8033.

 With rapid expansion underway, the brand has set aggressive expansion plans to open a multitude of new locations over the next five years, with territories available nationwide.
