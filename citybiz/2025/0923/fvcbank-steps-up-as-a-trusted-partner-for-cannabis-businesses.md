# FVCbank Steps Up as a Trusted Partner for Cannabis Businesses

Chairman & CEO David W. Pijor, Esq., along with the Bank’s cannabis banking team, share how FVCbank navigates a complex legal landscape to deliver safe, compliant financial services.

 As state legalization grows and federal legislation is unmoved, banks face a complex set of challenges — and opportunities. FVCbank is one of the few community banks in the Mid-Atlantic region offering transparent financial services to cannabis-related businesses (CRB’s).

 In this Q&A, FVCbank Chairman and CEO, David W. Pijor, along with Executive Vice President Jim Elliott and Cannabis Banking Officer Guinevere Pijor, share how the bank supports this rapidly growing sector while maintaining the highest standards of compliance and customer service.

 Why did FVCbank decide to serve the cannabis industry?

 David Pijor: We saw an unmet need in our market. Multiple legitimate, state-licensed CRB’s were operating without access to basic banking services in our communities, which forced them into unsafe, cash-heavy operations. We believe that every legal business deserves access to the financial system. By building a fully compliant cannabis banking program, we’re able to provide these companies with safe, secure, and transparent banking — so we can treat them like the legitimate businesses they are.

 How does the conflict between state and federal laws impact your work?

 David Pijor: It adds a layer of complexity to our operations to stay on the forefront of the industry. Cannabis remains illegal under federal law, which has historically meant traditional banking services were off-limits. Instead of shutting CRB’s out, we’ve built a specialized compliance program that includes rigorous due diligence, continuous transaction monitoring, and ongoing staff training. Just as importantly, we maintain regular communication with the appropriate regulatory agencies to ensure our program stays in good standing. This allows us to serve our clients with confidence while meeting every requirement placed on us as a financial institution.

 What makes FVCbank’s cannabis banking program different from others?

 Jim Elliott, EVP / Commercial Lending: Many financial institutions avoid the sector altogether or put hard limits on the types of relationships they allow. We’ve chosen the opposite path — to become experts in it. That means we can offer more than just a place to put deposits. We provide lending solutions, treasury management tools, and personal service from bankers who understand the industry’s unique challenges. Our goal is to help cannabis entrepreneurs grow and succeed, regardless of the changes we see in the industry.

 From your perspective, what do cannabis entrepreneurs need most from a bank?

 Guinevere Pijor, Cannabis Banking Officer: They need a real partner. This industry is highly regulated at the state level, and compliance is time-consuming, especially for independent operators or social equity licensees who may not have the same resources as a multi-state operator. We work closely with our clients to ensure their banking practices are as clean and transparent as possible, which protects both them and us. Having a banker who understands the licensing process, reporting requirements, and the broader industry landscape can save them countless hours and headaches.

 What does the future of cannabis banking look like?

 David Pijor: We expect to see continued state-by-state growth in legalization, and eventually, some form of federal action that provides greater clarity for financial institutions. In the meantime, we’ll keep doing what we do best — providing a safe harbor for legitimate businesses that are creating jobs, generating tax revenue, and serving their communities. We believe cannabis banking will move from the margins to the mainstream, and FVCbank intends to be a leader in that transition.
