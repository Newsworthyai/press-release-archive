# Padel 100 Raises €5m to Supercharge Ireland’s Padel Growth

Padel 100, Ireland’s fastest-growing operator, has today announced the launch of a €5 million raise under the Employment Investment Incentive Scheme (EIIS) to fund a rollout that will see 300 courts installed nationwide by December 2027. This marks an unprecedented step in the country’s padel journey.

 Early participation of investors is being rewarded with investments completed before 15 November 2025 qualifying for 50% EIIS income tax relief, and investments from 16 November 2025 (the date Padel 100 begins trading) qualifying for 35% tax relief.

 Installations are planned for this month, and at a rate of 10-12 courts per month, with 100 new courts estimated by April 2026. With more than 40 venues already confirmed and momentum building, Padel 100’s announcement is a signal of intent for the sports-mad nation and positions Ireland among Europe’s fastest-emerging padel markets for the very first time.

 Padel 100’s rollout is underpinned by strategic partnerships with Acenta Group (Sweden), Playtomic, and NXPadel, bringing world-class construction, booking technology, and materials to Ireland’s booming padel scene and helping provide the infrastructure needed to keep up with the fast momentum of Ireland’s padel scene.

 CEO and Founder of Padel 100, Ben Keohane commented: “We’re not talking about ideas on paper, we’re delivering with a groundbreaking initiative that signals a transformative moment in Ireland’s padel journey. With contracts signed, world-class partners secured, and demand accelerating, we are now well on track to reach 300 courts by Christmas 2027. For investors, this is momentum backed by facts, and through our innovative investment scheme, we are rewarding early investors the opportunity to qualify for 50% EIIS income tax relief before 15 November, and 35% thereafter. It’s a great offer for investors to achieve strong expected returns.”

 The raise, structured under Ireland’s EIIS scheme, gives investors the chance to back a sport that is booming worldwide while supporting the infrastructure to fuel Ireland’s rapid rise. By 2026, Padel 100’s network is forecast to host more than 800,000 annual player sessions and generate over €11 million in revenue, with further growth to follow.

 Globally, padel is one of the most dynamic sports, with 7,000 new courts built in 2024, a 92% player retention rate, and Olympic inclusion on the horizon. Ireland’s story will now be at the forefront of this movement, with Padel 100 driving a rollout of scale and speed rarely seen in sport.

 This raise offers a unique opportunity: to be part of Ireland’s sporting transformation, to fuel the growth of the world’s fastest-growing sport, and to back the operator building it at record pace.

 The EIIS structure offers prospective investors a compelling financial proposition:

 * 50% income tax relief if investing in Padel 100 before it begins trading on 15 November 2025 (tax relief drops to 35% from 16 November)
* 40% fixed return over four years
* Full capital repayment at Year 4
* Bonus royalty income for investments of €50,000 or more
* Optional conversion into equity for long-term upside

 A €10,000 investment delivers €19,000 back over four years, equating to an effective Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of nearly 50%. Larger investors also gain access to revenue-sharing opportunities, with the national network forecast to deliver over 832,000 annual player sessions by 2026.

 A full prospectus with further information on the EIIS can be found at the Padel 100 website. Note: EIIS investments are high-risk. Returns are not guaranteed. Tax relief depends on individual circumstances and Revenue approval. Figures are projections only. Investors should seek independent legal and financial advice.
