# Trinity Hunt Partners Brands Healthcare Advisory Platform as Acuvance and Continues Acquisitions

Trinity Hunt Partners, a growth-oriented private equity firm, is pleased to announce that its healthcare advisory platform has branded as Acuvance. Acuvance unites leading firms on a national platform, offering strategic, operational, financial, clinical, technology, and compliance expertise to help healthcare organizations adapt, perform, and grow.

 Acuvance was initially formed through Trinity Hunt’s foundational investment in Coker in December 2023, and the platform has subsequently made five strategic acquisitions. Acuvance is actively seeking additional acquisition opportunities to bolster its presence as a high-impact, scalable healthcare advisory firm capable of serving a wider range of client needs, including clinical advisory, revenue cycle transformation, and performance transformation.

 “The healthcare industry is facing unprecedented regulatory complexity and operational challenges that require sophisticated advisory solutions,” said Josh Nazarian, CEO of Acuvance. “Our mission is to help healthcare organizations succeed amid complexity. With sharp insight, deep expertise, pragmatic execution, and a relentless focus on outcomes, we empower healthcare organizations to make decisions with clarity and move forward with confidence. The Acuvance brand represents our vision to build a national leader that can address the full spectrum of financial, operational, and clinical healthcare advisory needs.”

 The platform’s growth strategy remains focused on executing strategic acquisitions, making targeted investments in talent and technology, and accelerating organic growth. As the platform continues to diversify beyond its provider-focused foundation, Acuvance is establishing new practice area pillars that will broaden its market reach and strategic service capabilities.

 Joining CEO Josh Nazarian on the platform leadership team are Alex Graves (Chief Financial Officer), John Reiboldt (Chief Development Officer), Michelle Liro (Senior VP of Marketing), Ayanna Chambliss (Senior VP of Talent Success), and Greg Alperstein (VP of Integrations).

 “The Acuvance platform combines leading healthcare advisory firms, building on the exceptional client service and relationships that Coker has demonstrated for over three decades,” said John Oakes, Partner at Trinity Hunt Partners. “The capabilities of Acuvance’s leadership team, combined with their exceptional strategic vision for the platform, position us well to become a differentiated leader in the healthcare advisory space.”
