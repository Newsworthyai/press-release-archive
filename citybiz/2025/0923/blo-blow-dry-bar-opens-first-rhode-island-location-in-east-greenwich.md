# Blo Blow Dry Bar Opens First Rhode Island Location in East Greenwich

Blo Blow Dry Bar, North America’s original blow dry bar franchise, will open its first Rhode Island location in East Greenwich on Friday, October 3, with a grand opening celebration on October 16. Located at 1000 Division Street, Unit 64, the new bar will offer Blo’s signature blow outs, à la carte add-ons, a selection of hair treatments, and expert makeup services for events and special occasions.

 To celebrate its opening, the East Greenwich bar will offer two limited-time promotions:

 * $75 for 75 Founding Members: For the first 75 Members, Blo Blow Dry Bar in East Greenwich will offer a $75 founder’s rate for its signature Mane Squeeze Membership, which includes two blow outs a month, $5 off each additional blow out, discounts on retail & other services, and many more perks!
* Special Opening Rate: $45 blow outs (regularly $55) from October 3 through October 16.

 Owned and operated by Rhode Island native Maria M. Porreca, the East Greenwich bar is her first of three Blo locations she plans to open in her home state. Inspired by her family’s small business background and spending more than a decade in New York City working in finance, Porreca returned to Rhode Island to be closer to family shortly after her daughters were born. After a few years back home juggling motherhood and working as a busy financial executive, she recognized the need to bring a service she heavily relied on while living in New York back to her home community.

 “After years in Manhattan and weekly blow outs and numerous make-up appointments, I saw firsthand the difference a reliable, time-saving beauty service makes,” said Porreca. “As a mom of six-year-old twins and someone who grew up around small business, I wanted to create a space that helps guests decompress and feel confident. Opening in Unit 64 feels especially full circle for me, since my own Blo journey began years ago on 64th Street.”

 Blo Blow Dry Bar is on a mission to create a space where people of all ages, ethnicities, and orientations are welcomed, represented, and made to feel gorgeous while emphasizing the need for self-care and wellness. Combining a sophisticated design with a fun and energetic environment, Blo cultivates a seamless and enjoyable experience for guests upon their arrival, during, and after their services. Expertly trained stylists are available for consultation seven days a week to meet the needs of all guests. The brand’s hair menu includes five signature styles from sleek and straight to bouncy curls, plus a wide assortment of customized looks including updo’s and braids. Blo Blow Dry Bar also offers makeup services from expert artists on hand to help guests look and feel amazing for any occasion.

 Blo Blow Dry Bar East Greenwich will be open Monday through Wednesday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Thursday – Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., with early morning and late evening services available by appointment from 7 a.m.–9 a.m. and 7 p.m.–9 p.m. for guests with busy schedules.
