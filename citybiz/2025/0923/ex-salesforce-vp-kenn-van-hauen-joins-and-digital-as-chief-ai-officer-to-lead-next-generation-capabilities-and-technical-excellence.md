AND Digital, the international technology consultancy company, has appointed Kenn van Hauen as Chief AI Officer to lead the company’s AI, Automation, and Intelligent Systems Practice Area while overseeing the evolution of expertise across all strategic disciplines.

 “My role is about ensuring AND Digital leads through technical excellence across all our practice areas, with AI as the catalyst for transformation. The companies that will win aren’t those with the most pilots, they’re those with the discipline to connect technology to customer value, build sustainable AI economics, and create the orchestration infrastructure that makes these systems work at scale.”

His unique combination of strategic vision and delivery credibility, proven across both consulting and technology leadership roles, makes him the ideal person to ensure we’re not just keeping pace with technological change but staying ahead of it.”
