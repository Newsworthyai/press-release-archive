# Winners of the Futur/io CSO Awards North America 25 Announced

The names of the most important Chief Sustainability Officers of North America were announced at the Futur/io CSO Awards on Monday night. The celebration took place at a gala dinner at the newly opened and stunning vitra design showroom, during New York Climate Week.

 Erik Hansen, Chief Sustainability Officer at Workday received the CSO Award /25 in Gold.

 The Silver Award went to Jackie Jung, Vice President, Global Operations Strategy & Planning, Corporate Sustainability at Western Digital, while the Bronze Award was granted to Susan Uthayakumar, Chief Energy and Sustainability Officer of Prologis.

 The Grand Jury also granted two Special Honour CSO Awards to Annika Dubrall from Tiffany & Co., and Ann Tracy from Colgate-Palmolive.

 Ara Erickson from Weyerhaeuser received a special Sustainable Supply Chain Award presented by Simon Jaehnig, Co-Founder & President of IntegrityNext Inc.

 The Peer Award, chosen by the live audience of the CSO Awards gala ceremony, went to Jennifer Motles, Chief Sustainability Officer at Philip Morris International, and was presented by jury members Livio Scalvini, Co-Founder and executive director of the Leonardo Centre on Business for Society at Imperial College London and Daniel Erasmus, Founder of ClimateGPT.

 Among the speakers of the evening were Sandrine Dixson-Declève, of the Club of Rome, Magnus Drewelies, of CEEZER Software, Nina Eisenman, of NASDAQ, Raphael Gielgen, of vitra and jury members among others.

 “Our mission is to shine a light on the role of Chief Sustainability Officers, we hope to inspire others to be ambitious and work on building the desirable futures we want to live in,” said Harald Neidhardt, CEO & Curator of the Futur/io Institute. “These years winners and 20 nominees are exemplary in their commitment towards keeping the pace needed to solve for the Sustainable Development Goals and higher ambition for NetZero, e.g. a goal of 2040 or better.”

In the three months of data collection and analysis, Futur/io and its partners recognized delay in reporting compared to 2024, and some companies even retracted their earlier reporting on sustainability. The business climate can be characterized by geopolitical headwinds, economic pressures and potential “greenhushing”. Also, the participation in our annual survey -that was sent to big name corporations you might expect as leaders in their field and missing among the 20 nominees – lacked support by some CSOs.

 The final winners were selected from the 20 Nominees list by a Grand Jury that includes some of the most influential and inspiring voices in sustainability.

 Members include John Elkington, known as “the Godfather of Sustainability”, Sandrine Dixson-Declève, honorary president of the Club of Rome, Michael Kobori, former Chief Sustainability Officer for Starbucks, and winner of the CSO Awards Gold in 2024. Additional members are Niyanta Spelman, CEO of Rainforest Partnership, and Nina Eisenman, Vice president at NASDAQ, and Vandinika Shukla, Deputy Director of Global Programs (USA Lead), Obama Foundation. The Chair of the Jury is Harald Neidhardt, CEO and Curator of the Futur/io Institute.

 This is the second edition of the CSO Awards North America, an initiative of the Futur/io Institute, a pioneering organisation dedicated to nurturing and inspiring leadership in sustainable innovation and building the most impactful network of Chief Sustainability Officers globally. The European edition of the CSO Awards took place in Davos, parallel to the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2025.
