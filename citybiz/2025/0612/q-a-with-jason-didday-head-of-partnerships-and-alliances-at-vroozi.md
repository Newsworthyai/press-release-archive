# Q&amp;A with Jason Didday, Head of Partnerships and Alliances at Vroozi

Jason Didday recently joined Vroozi as Head of Partnerships and Alliances after 25 years in procurement software, most recently as VP of Customer Success North America at SAP. At SAP, he built and led customer success programs covering major Fortune 100 companies and managed over $1 billion in cloud revenue. Before his executive roles, Didday established SAP’s Model Company and Services Portfolio offerings and spent years as a consultant implementing ERP solutions at Accenture and other firms. He will be based in Denver and focuses on building strategic partnerships with major software providers and consulting firms.

 What attracted you to leave SAP after so many years to join Vroozi?

 After spending decades watching procurement teams struggle with overcomplicated systems, I was drawn to Vroozi’s approach of solving real problems simply. Too many procurement solutions try to boil the ocean or overthink what should be straightforward purchasing processes. Vroozi delivers an Amazon-like experience that procurement teams can deploy in weeks, not months, while giving finance teams the spend control they need.

 What really excited me was that Vroozi isn’t trying to replace anyone’s ERP backbone. We’re solving the procurement piece quickly so partners can focus on strategic implementations that truly differentiate their clients’ operations.

 How do you see partnerships fitting into Vroozi’s growth strategy?

 We’re building an ecosystem where everyone wins. Large software companies like SAP and Deltek, along with consulting firms like Accenture and Deloitte, need to deliver quick wins for their clients while working on longer-term strategic projects. Vroozi provides that immediate value in procurement automation.

 The mid-market especially needs enterprise-grade procurement capabilities without the complexity of traditional enterprise software. We can get customers up and running with full procurement control in a matter of weeks, creating the quick wins that allow our partners to focus on the complex, strategic work that really moves the needle.

 What challenges do you see in the current procurement technology landscape?

 The biggest issue is the gap between what procurement teams need and what they’re getting from traditional enterprise software. Companies are looking at half-year or year-long implementations when they need solutions now. Meanwhile, their teams are pulling out personal credit cards for business purchases because going through official processes is such a hassle.

 There’s also this false choice between rigorous financial controls and responsive sourcing. Organizations shouldn’t have to choose between spend compliance and the agility their business demands. The right platform gives you both.

 How will your SAP background help in building these new partnerships?

 My 25 years in this space taught me that successful partnerships aren’t about competing – they’re about complementing each other’s strengths. At SAP, I saw firsthand how customers struggle with procurement modules that were built as afterthoughts to larger ERP systems.

 I also learned the importance of customer success from day one. We had to transition from a “sell and see you later” model to taking care of customers from contract signing through renewal and beyond. That experience will be invaluable as we build partner relationships focused on mutual customer success.

 What’s your approach to building successful partnerships?

 It starts with being flexible and agile enough to create partnerships that make sense for each partner. We’re not looking for one-size-fits-all relationships. Some partners will bring customers to us, others we’ll bring customers to them, and the best partnerships will be truly mutual.

 The key is proving value quickly. When a partner can show their client immediate ROI from procurement automation, it strengthens that partner relationship and builds trust for larger strategic initiatives. Everyone wins when customers see fast results.

 How do you see the procurement software market evolving?

 We’re moving from a world where procurement was a necessary evil to one where it’s a competitive advantage. Companies that can source quickly and compliantly will outmaneuver competitors still bogged down in manual processes.

 The winners will be platforms that combine enterprise-grade capabilities with consumer-level ease of use. People expect their work tools to be as intuitive as their personal shopping experiences. When you can deliver that simplicity while maintaining the controls finance teams require, you’ve solved the fundamental challenge in procurement technology.

 What are your immediate priorities in this new role?

 First, I’m focusing on deepening relationships with our existing partners and identifying new opportunities with major software providers and consulting firms. Second, I want to clearly articulate how Vroozi fits into the broader enterprise software ecosystem – not as a replacement, but as an accelerator.

 The goal is to position Vroozi as the solution that helps partners deliver immediate value while they work on longer-term strategic implementations. When procurement is running smoothly from day one, everyone can focus on the work that really differentiates the business.
