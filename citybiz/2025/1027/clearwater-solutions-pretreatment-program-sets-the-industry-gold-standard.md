# ClearWater Solutions’ Pretreatment Program Sets the Industry Gold Standard

ClearWater’s Environmental Engineer Adam Bonomo leads initiatives that help municipalities and industries meet Clean Water Act standards and protect water resources

 ClearWater Solutions (CWS), a nationally recognized provider of water and wastewater management services, is raising the bar for industrial pretreatment programs through efforts spearheaded by Environmental Engineer Adam Bonomo.

 The highly regulated field plays a pivotal role in environmental compliance for both municipalities and private industries, ensuring the chemical and physical treatment of industrial wastewater before it reaches municipal treatment plants.

 “Industrial pretreatment is a niche area of environmental engineering that most people stay away from because of its complexity,” said Bonomo. “But it’s critical. We’re protecting not only our infrastructure and treatment plants, but also our water resources, employees and communities.”

 ClearWater works at the intersection of public utilities and private industry, helping both sides navigate the complex world of industrial pretreatment. Through its programs, the team develops and manages permits that define what can safely enter municipal wastewater systems, ensuring that discharges remain within the limits outlined in federal, state and local pretreatment regulations.

 Bonomo’s role extends across the full spectrum of pretreatment services—from analyzing industrial processes and characterizing waste streams to supporting ongoing compliance, monitoring and reporting. By working closely with municipalities, regulators and industrial clients alike, ClearWater helps build stronger partnerships that protect infrastructure, support economic growth and maintain environmental compliance.

 Bonomo currently supports Sierra Bullets in Sedalia, Missouri, optimizing their treatment process to achieve effective metal removal and maintain compliance with city-issued permits.

 On the municipal side, he’s leading efforts in Ellijay, Georgia, where ClearWater manages the wastewater plant and works closely with local officials to address challenges at a nearby poultry processing facility, the plant’s largest industrial discharger.

 “Every situation is different,” Bonomo explained. “For example, a client like the town of Decherd, TN — in which Nissan operates its own wastewater treatment system to handle processed water containing heavy metals before discharge — is a component that we oversee, ensuring that those systems are working properly and staying within compliance limits.”

 With industrial categories such as metal finishing, food manufacturing and automotive production representing the largest sources of regulated discharges, ClearWater’s pretreatment expertise has become increasingly valuable.

 Demand for qualified pretreatment professionals continues to outpace supply, creating opportunities for ClearWater to expand its educational and advisory efforts.

 “We are proud and grateful for Adam’s (Bonomo) work,” said Paul Quentel, CEO of ClearWater Solutions. “This component of our business is a crucial component of appropriately dealing with the overall wastewater process, and because of his work we are definitely ahead of the curve in this arena.”

 Beyond field operations, Bonomo has also taken on a role in education and outreach, speaking at regional and state-level conferences to help industry professionals understand and navigate the pretreatment process.

 “We’re not just solving today’s problems,” Bonomo said. “We’re helping clients build the knowledge to prevent tomorrow’s.”

 As municipalities and industries face increasing regulations and environmental challenges, ClearWater Solutions’ pretreatment programs led by Adam Bonomo stand out as a benchmark for compliance, collaboration and innovation.
