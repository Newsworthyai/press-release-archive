# Reading Gets Better with Age: La Posada Residents Celebrate National Book Month

Monthly book club draws growing interest among residents and has reached full capacity

 They say you’re never too old to turn the page on a good story, and residents at La Posada are living proof. In celebration of National Book Month, La Posada is shining a spotlight on one of its most popular resident groups, the La Posada Book Club, where meaningful conversation, connection, and a shared love of reading take center stage.

 The club, facilitated by longtime reader and La Posada resident Constance “Connie” Tozer, meets on the fourth Wednesday of each month in one of the community’s shared gathering spaces. What started as a casual group of readers has grown into a lively circle of 17 members so popular that the club had to cap attendance and even inspired new book clubs across the community.

 “I’ve always loved to read,” said Connie, La Posada resident. “My mother used to take me to the library every Saturday when I was growing up. When I moved to La Posada and saw they already had a book club, I was thrilled to join and help out where I could.”

 At each monthly meeting, members gather with fruit, cheese, and wine provided by La Posada’s culinary team, ready to discuss the latest selection. The group votes together on which books to read, ensuring everyone has a voice. One member volunteers to lead the discussion — though, as Connie puts it, “it’s truly a group effort.”

 The club’s reading list includes a mix of fiction and nonfiction titles, from historical accounts to stories set in faraway countries like Afghanistan and South Korea. But one rule always stands: no political books — members come together to discuss stories, not to debate them. “You may not love every book,” said Connie, “but you always learn something from it.”

 La Posada supports the club by purchasing both large-print and regular-print copies of each title to ensure all residents can participate. Many members also enjoy e-books on their personal Kindles or through apps like Hoopla and Cloud Library, often with books borrowed free from the Florida library system. What makes the club truly special are the friendships it fosters.

 “It’s not just about reading, it’s about connecting,” said Connie. “We’ve built real friendships through this group, and I look forward to our meetings every month.”

 According to several studies cited by organizations such as Harvard Health and the National Institute on Aging, reading and participating in book clubs later in life can help improve memory, reduce stress, boost mental sharpness, and even support longevity. These are benefits Connie often reminds her fellow members of when opening each meeting and a big part of why the group continues to thrive.

 “La Posada is proud to support programs that inspire our residents to keep learning, connecting, and exploring new ideas,” said Brad Cadiere, executive director at La Posada. “Our library and book club are perfect examples of how we nurture community and lifelong curiosity. It’s always wonderful to see the excitement build up when a new book is chosen or a meeting is around the corner. The conversations, laughter, and connections that come from those gatherings truly bring our community to life.”

 For Connie, that curiosity never fades. “The joy of reading is that it always teaches you something new whether it’s a lesson, a story, or just a feeling,” said Connie. “My favorite book is always the one I’m reading right now.”
