# Friend Commercial Real Estate Facilitates Sale of Historic Downtown Annapolis Building

Friend Commercial Real Estate is pleased to announce the sale of a two-story retail building located in the heart of Historic Downtown Annapolis, just steps from City Dock. Lynn Dulin, CCIM of Friend Commercial Real Estate represented the Seller. The Buyer was a local investor, and the sale quietly closed this past fall.

 The building, totaling approximately 1,956 square feet, had been in the same family for decades and this transaction marks the first arms-length sale of the property since the late 1960s. The property is currently leased out to a local clothing boutique.

 “This sale represented the end of a long chapter for a family with deep ties to the Annapolis community,” said Dulin. “We’re proud to have helped transition this Main Street gem to new local ownership, where it will continue to contribute to the area’s vibrant mix of retail, dining, and cultural experiences.”
