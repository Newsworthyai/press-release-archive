# Q&amp;A with Scott Peper, CEO &amp; Founder of Mobilization Funding

Scott Peper is the Chief Executive Officer and founder of Mobilization Funding. Prior to Mobilization Funding, Scott spent 17 years in the healthcare industry, where he held numerous positions in sales, sales management, corporate contracting, and executive management.

 We want to help change the narrative around what construction businesses look like and support them with tools and capital that reflect their actual needs and potential.

 He is the host of the business and entrepreneurial podcast, “The Mobilization Mindset” and author of “The Big Book of Cash Flow.” He is known across the construction industry for the content and education he offers to the community and his expertise in helping businesses successfully cash flow their projects and customers.

 Tell us about your background and what led you to start Mobilization Funding.

 I began my career in medical device sales, leading teams and working with highly disciplined corporate processes. But over time, I realized I was more passionate about building businesses than just selling within one. When a close friend called to tell me he had an idea to help construction contractors solve their cash flow issues upon starting a project, I was paying attention.

 My father owned and operated a construction business for many decades and I knew cash flow was a serious issue. He had the opportunity to take on a big job, but couldn’t cover labor and material costs upfront. Banks wouldn’t lend to him because the job hadn’t technically started, and the money wasn’t in hand yet. That experience exposed a larger, systemic gap in how contractors are supported financially. I started Mobilization Funding to solve that problem, and we’ve been doing just that ever since.

 What makes Mobilization Funding different from traditional lenders?

 We’re not just a lending company providing cash. We’ve created a loan program and are a partner in helping contractors and manufacturers grow in a way that’s sustainable. Traditional lenders often don’t understand the cash flow cycles of project-based businesses and they do not want to give them any financing for work they have not yet completed or for work that is project based and progress-billed. And in the few instances they do look at the business, it is often them trying to make it look like a retail shop or recurring-revenue model, which doesn’t translate.

 We take a different approach. We build a project cash flow model before we ever issue a loan. That allows our clients to see the entire financial landscape of a job before getting started on the project. Our loan structure also aligns repayment of the loan with actual project payment or milestones. The result is a funding experience that adds stability rather than strain.

 You recently launched Maximus. What is it and why does it matter to your customers?

 Maximus is our new digital loan management platform, and it represents a huge leap forward in how capital is delivered to contractors and manufacturers. It allows users to apply for loans, upload documents, communicate with our team, request disbursements, and monitor funding timelines all in one place. It’s fast, secure, and built with the workflows of construction and manufacturing in mind. This gives the clients the ability to access their information anytime and allows our team the time to speak live to our clients to manage and help with what they really need help with.

 But Maximus isn’t just a customer portal. It’s a tool that simplifies the entire process of getting and managing capital for project-based businesses. It uses automation and document recognition technology to move things along quickly. More importantly, it includes a built-in cash flow tool, so contractors can model out project expenses and disbursements before a single dollar is spent. That kind of visibility is a game-changer. Maximus gives construction and manufacturing business owners the confidence and control they need to take on larger jobs and grow strategically.

 Which kinds of companies benefit most from your solutions?

 We work primarily with all types of commercial subcontractors and manufacturers, especially the trade contractors who are on these projects from the start. These are the businesses that often have to mobilize quickly and fund a job upfront long before they see payment. They’re the ones who do the work first but get paid last. We also work with manufacturers who are producing on order or contract terms, where the delays between building and getting paid can strain cash flow. Our funding model is tailored for these gaps.

 What are some misconceptions about construction financing you want to change?

 There’s a common belief that if a contractor needs a loan, it’s because their business is failing or unstable. That could not be further from the truth. In construction, every part of the project is financed in some way. The developers use financing. The general contractors use financing. The only person who typically doesn’t is the subcontractor, and that puts them at risk. Using capital strategically is not a sign of weakness. It’s a sign of smart business. The goal is to make funding work for you, not against you.

 You often talk about a mindset shift in the construction industry. What do you mean by that?

 For years, construction has been viewed as a brute-force industry: physical, slow to change, and old school in its operations. But the truth is, construction is full of innovation and entrepreneurship. There are contractors today using digital estimating tools, drones, and AI-driven scheduling. What they often lack is access to modern financial infrastructure.

 We want to help change the narrative around what construction businesses look like and support them with tools and capital that reflect their actual needs and potential. We have learned that when construction contractors have the right information they can make effective decisions that improve the whole project and all of the stakeholders; it is often the absence of information that causes issues, not the decision making.

 What’s something people might not realize about the customers you serve?

 Many of our clients are first-time borrowers or have traditional financing from banks (like a line of credit) but just not enough for the size of their business. Others have had bad experiences with high-cost, quick-cash lenders that left them stuck. When they come to us, they often expect another transactional experience. But when we sit down and walk them through a detailed cash flow analysis, it’s often the first time they’ve seen their project finances laid out clearly. That clarity is powerful. It gives them a roadmap to profitability and the confidence to grow. We’re not just offering funding. We’re helping people build a better business.

 What’s next for Mobilization Funding and Maximus?

 We’re continuing to expand the features within Maximus to serve our clients even better. That includes more automation, better integrations, and smarter ways to predict and manage project cash flow. We’re also investing in education and resources so that our clients not only get funding but also understand how to use it strategically. Our goal is to continue being a trusted partner that helps businesses grow job by job, year by year. Everything we build is in service of that mission.
