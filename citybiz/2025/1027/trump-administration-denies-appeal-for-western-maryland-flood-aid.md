# Trump Administration Denies Appeal For Western Maryland Flood Aid

The Trump administration on Thursday denied an appeal for federal disaster aid to Western Maryland for the May floods in Allegany and Garrett Counties.

 The appeal for a major disaster declaration would have made the counties eligible for funds to repair critical infrastructure and initiate projects to halt the risk of future flooding.

 “This outcome is not just deeply frustrating, it also ignores the devastation wrought by historic floods in Appalachia and leaves Marylanders on their own,” Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, said in a statement.

 There is no legal recourse for the state to obtain additional funding, Moore said. While appeals can be denied by the administration on any terms, Maryland lawmakers saw the denial as a political stunt.

 “It is so disappointing but not at all surprising to see the Trump administration has left Maryland behind,” Democratic Sen. Angela Alsobrooks said. “Marylanders pay into our government with the expectation it will be there for them when disaster strikes. Trump cares more about supporting billionaires than supporting Americans facing disaster.”

 Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen said the denial of FEMA assistance will “unnecessarily set back the rebuilding of roads, reconstruction of public schools, and repair of homes and small businesses that were left damaged by these unprecedented storms.”

 Rep. April McClain Delaney, D-Maryland, who represents Allegany County, said the denial is “completely indefensible.”

 “Politics should play no role in the distribution of FEMA funds and emergency resources, which must be awarded by law based on preset qualifying levels of damage—irrespective of zip code or political affiliation,” Delaney said.

 The appeal, filed in August, was a direct response to the denial of initial disaster funds in May. FEMA previously validated more than $33 million in damages to the counties, which was nearly three times the qualifying threshold for assistance in Maryland, according to state officials.

 Following the initial disaster, Moore declared a state of emergency in May to accelerate the state’s response. He later awarded Allegany County more than $400,000 to support relief efforts through the Maryland State Disaster Recovery Fund, the first-ever state-led relief account.

 In July, Moore announced an additional $1 million to be dedicated to Low Income Home Energy Assistance Programs funds for families in Garrett and Allegany Counties.

 Local lawmakers and community leaders said the Trump administration’s denial will have lasting impacts on the already vulnerable counties.

 “We are incredibly disappointed in this decision,” Allegany County Commission President Dave Caporale said. “Our application for FEMA assistance met — and in many areas exceeded — every requirement for federal aid. Allegany County is a small, rural Appalachian community, and this denial leaves us feeling forgotten by the federal government.”

 For residents, there is still a long road to recovery ahead.

 With limited state funding available for rebuilding and flood protection, the lack of federal aid will slow progress. However, support to the counties will continue, regardless of the denial, Moore said.

 “President Trump and his administration have politicized disaster relief, and our communities are the ones who will pay the price,” Moore said. “While we disagree with both this process and outcome, our resolve is unbroken. We will continue to support Marylanders recovering from these storms, even if Washington won’t.”
