 You lead both marketing and innovation at IDIQ, two functions that are increasingly intertwined. How did your career path lead you to this combined role, and what excites you most about working at this intersection?

 My career has always focused on understanding people and technology. Marketing has taught me how to tell stories that connect and resonate with consumers, while innovation has shown me how to translate those insights into solutions. At IDIQ, I have the opportunity to merge both by using creativity and technology to empower consumers to protect their identities and strengthen their financial lives.

 IDIQ operates in a fast-moving environment around credit monitoring, identity protection, and financial wellness. How do you see innovation driving growth and differentiation in these markets? How do you stay ahead of your competitors?

 Innovation is what defines us as a leader in the industry. We move quickly to identify emerging threats, trends, and technologies that impact consumers’ financial well-being. By investing in data intelligence and user experience, we stay ahead of the curve and deliver tools that are smarter, faster, and more personalized than our competitors.

 In both of your roles, how do you balance creativity with data, ensuring marketing efforts stay fresh and authentic while remaining grounded in analytics and measurable ROI?

 Creativity and data are at the foundation of everything we do. Data reveals what motivates consumers, while creativity transforms those insights into stories that inspire action. Every campaign begins with insight and ends with measurable results. We focus on delivering marketing that connects, while remaining accountable to performance and ROI.

 What does the innovation process look like inside IDIQ? Can you share how an idea moves from concept to implementation, and how marketing insights help shape that journey?

 Innovation at IDIQ is fueled by collaboration and a relentless drive to improve. Ideas emerge across every team that are shaped by data, creativity, and consumer insight. From concept to execution, we test and refine until the solution delivers real impact. Marketing connects each stage of that process by transforming insights into clear, compelling experiences that build trust, drive engagement, and keep IDIQ at the forefront of financial intelligence.

 In today’s landscape, customer expectations evolve faster than ever. How do you and your team leverage technology, data, and consumer feedback to anticipate what customers need before they ask for it, leading to new products?

 We combine data analytics with human insight. By monitoring behavior patterns and listening to our members, we can identify emerging needs early. That approach allows us to deliver products and features that provide value before a problem becomes a pain point.

 Many companies talk about being “customer-focused.” What does that mean in practice for IDIQ, and how does innovation in your marketing strategy help strengthen customer trust and engagement?

 For us, being consumer-focused is about educating and building trust. We make tricky financial topics easy to understand, so you can take control of your credit and protect your identity with peace of mind. Every marketing message reflects that mission to educate, protect, and empower.

 You’ve overseen the launch of several new products and features. Which innovations or campaigns are you most proud of, and what impact have they had on IDIQ’s growth or brand perception?

 I’m proud of how we’ve evolved from identity theft protection into a complete financial intelligence platform. Features such as personalized credit coaching and CreditBuilderIQ, which allows consumers to take control of their credit, have expanded our reach and helped redefine what financial protection means for today’s consumers.

 With AI reshaping how marketing and product development work, how is IDIQ approaching responsible use of AI, both internally and in customer-facing experiences?

 We use AI to enhance precision, not replace human insight. AI helps us analyze data and improve experiences, but people remain at the heart of every decision.

 Culture plays a critical role in sustaining innovation. How do you encourage creativity and cross-functional collaboration across your marketing, product, and technology teams?

 We emphasize open communication and shared ownership. Our teams work closely from the start of every project. Collaboration is part of our culture and drives many of our best innovations.

 Looking ahead, what are the biggest opportunities you see for IDIQ to lead, whether through new technologies, partnerships, or customer experiences?

 Our greatest opportunities lie in innovation and collaboration. We are launching new products that use advanced analytics and AI to deliver the best financial and identity protection. At the same time, we are expanding partnerships that will bring new avenues for growth and enhanced consumer experiences.

 What advice would you give to leaders trying to build alignment between innovation and marketing in their own organizations?

 When innovation and marketing work from a shared understanding of the people we serve, everything works toward the same goal. This focus builds meaningful connections, smarter solutions, and stronger results.
