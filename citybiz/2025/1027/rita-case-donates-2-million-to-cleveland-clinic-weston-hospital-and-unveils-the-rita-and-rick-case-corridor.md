# Rita Case Donates $2 Million to Cleveland Clinic Weston Hospital and Unveils the Rita and Rick Case Corridor

The gift supports continued research, education and innovation

 Rita Case, president and CEO of Rick Case Automotive Group, presented Cleveland Clinic Weston Hospital with a $2 million gift to support research, education, patient care, programmatic and capital needs.

 “We have always looked for opportunities to improve the healthcare needs of our community by supporting the growth and advancement of healthcare services and supporting the many healthcare professionals who are truly the unsung heroes,” said Case. “Working together, we can continue to build a thriving and healthy community.”

 In recognition of this gift, Cleveland Clinic Weston Hospital unveiled signage for the Rita and Rick Case Corridor in its primary multispecialty and ambulatory surgery clinic, which serves as a prominent pathway for patients, visitors and caregivers. Case was joined at the ceremony by leadership from Rick Case Automotive Group and Cleveland Clinic including Conor Delaney, MD, PhD, Executive Vice President, Cleveland Clinic and President, Cleveland Clinic Florida Market; F. Scott Ross, MD, Vice President and Chief Medical Officer for Cleveland Clinic Weston Hospital; and Michael Maroone, Chair, Cleveland Clinic Florida Regional Hospital Board of Directors; as well as City of Weston Mayor Margaret (Peggy) Brown, Town of Davie Mayor Judy Paul and Broward County Commissioner Nan H. Rich.

 “We are deeply grateful to Rita Case for her ongoing support of Cleveland Clinic,” said Dr. Ross. “Generous gifts like hers directly fuel the research, education and innovation that create opportunities for our caregivers to better serve the needs and well-being of our patients.”

 Case and her husband, Rick Case, have been long-time supporters of Cleveland Clinic Weston Hospital. Since 2016, they’ve gifted $3,115,500 to the hospital. The family’s first gift supported the hospital’s expansion with the naming of The Rick Case Automotive Group Cafeteria in their honor. The cafeteria was remodeled for patients, their families and caregivers, serving as a central gathering place in the hospital for dining and connection. Throughout the years, when a hurricane is imminent, the Case family has opened the gas stations at their dealerships exclusively for the hospital’s doctors, nurses and staff. Case also serves in a key leadership role as a member of the hospital’s board of directors.

 “Rita is doing a remarkable job leaving an incredible legacy in the community and preserving Rick’s memory,” said Dr. Delaney. “Her support means so much to all of us, inspiring and strengthening Cleveland Clinic’s mission of world-class care, research and health. We are proud to join with the Case family as we continue working together to enrich the health and well-being of our community.”

 Cleveland Clinic Weston Hospital was named the No. 1 hospital in Miami-Fort Lauderdale, according to the 2025-2026 U.S. News & World Report “Best Hospitals” rankings. The hospital was also named Newsweek’s World’s Best Hospitals 2025 list, earning the highest ranking in South Florida.
