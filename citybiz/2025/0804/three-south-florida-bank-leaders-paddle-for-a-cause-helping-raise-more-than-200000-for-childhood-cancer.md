# Three South Florida Bank Leaders Paddle for a Cause, Helping Raise More Than $200,000 for Childhood Cancer

In a show of unity and compassion, three South Florida banking executives joined fellow paddlers in trading boardrooms for kayaks, participating in Kayaking the Keys for Hope and collectively helping to raise over $230,000 for the SebastianStrong Foundation and its mission to fight childhood cancer.

 Luis de la Aguilera, President, CEO, and Chairman of U.S. Century Bank; Keith Costello, Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO of Locality Bank; and Jose Cueto, CEO of Grove Bank & Trust, joined forces on the waters of the Florida Keys to support children and families battling the disease.

 Though competitors in the financial sector, the trio demonstrated that community impact transcends business rivalries.

 “While our banks may compete, we are united in our commitment to making a difference,” said de la Aguilera. “This journey was about hope, strength, and standing with kids who need us most.”

 “Participating in Kayaking the Keys for Hope alongside two fellow bank CEOs was an incredibly meaningful experience,” said Cueto. “Coming together in support of SebastianStrong and its mission to fund pediatric cancer research reflects the power of collective leadership and shared purpose. It was a privilege to contribute to a cause that brings hope to children and families facing unimaginable challenges.”

 “Locality Bank and I are so proud to support SebastianStrong,” said Costello. “Kayaking the Keys for Hope is a great way to raise money for research and awareness of pediatric cancer. Along with Luis, Jose, and the rest of the kayakers, it was a wonderful experience.”

 The funds raised will go toward critical research and support services for pediatric cancer patients and their families.
