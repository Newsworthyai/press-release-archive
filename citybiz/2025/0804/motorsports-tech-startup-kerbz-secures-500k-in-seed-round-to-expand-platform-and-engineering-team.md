# Motorsports Tech Startup Kerbz Secures $500K in Seed Round to Expand Platform and Engineering Team

DC-based Kerbz Adventures, a rising tech player in the grassroots motorsports space, has raised $500,000 in seed funding to expand its digital platform that connects amateur drivers with event organizers, vehicles, and coaching services.

 The round was backed by a syndicate of motorsports insiders, angel investors, and product-oriented operators. The company plans to use the capital to grow its engineering team, accelerate product development, and expand into new geographic markets.

 Kerbzâ€™s platform aims to modernize the fragmented world of amateur motorsports, offering a mobile-first suite of tools for everything from event registration and real-time paddock check-in to vehicle rentals and AI-based lap coaching. Among its current features: digital inspections, integrated scheduling, social tools, and an interface that allows instructors and clubs to manage track days more efficiently.

 The company is also preparing to roll out an AI-powered lap coaching marketplace, a peer-to-peer vehicle sharing platform, and a motorsports-native social graph to foster deeper community engagement. Early adopters include driving clubs, instructors, and independent track organizers who have been using the platform for events across the Mid-Atlantic region.
