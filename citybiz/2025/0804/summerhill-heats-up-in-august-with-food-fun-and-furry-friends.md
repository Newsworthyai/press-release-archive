 Atlanta’s historic Summerhill neighborhood is buzzing with energy this August, offering a mix of culinary exploration, back-to-school celebrations, beauty experiences and even a day dedicated to four-legged friends. From globally inspired cuisine to neighborhood gatherings, here’s what’s happening in Summerhill this month:

 * Little Bear’s Romanian Prix Fixe Menu – Chef’s heritage takes center stage in an adventurous Romanian-inspired prix fixe menu available through August. Dishes feature bold takes on traditional flavors, such as sarmale amuse, trout and rice meatball sour soup, lamb mititei with blackberry cayenne sauce and a farmer’s cheese donut dessert. Reservations can be made via Resy.
* Big Softie’s Give-A-Swirl Cards – Perfect for teacher gifts and summer surprises, these cards are redeemable for one petite swirl and a topping of choice. Give-a-Swirl cards are a sweet and thoughtful way to treat someone special.
* How Crispy’s Roasted Boi Sandwich (pictured below) – The beloved chicken shop is highlighting its Roasted Boi sandwich this August. The hearty handheld features roasted chicken breast, house spread, crisp romaine lettuce and pickles on a soft bun. Guests can make it “Austin-style” with American cheese and bacon for an extra punch of flavor.
* Aviary Beauty + Wellness Pop-Up with Courtney Jane (Aug. 5-10) – Aviary hosts esthetician Courtney Jane for a weeklong beauty experience. Guests can also take advantage of the extended Rising Esthetics discount of $20 off facials booked using code RISING20.
