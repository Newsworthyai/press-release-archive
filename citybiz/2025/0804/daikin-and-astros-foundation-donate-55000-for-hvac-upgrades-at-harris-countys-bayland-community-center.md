# Daikin and Astros Foundation Donate $55,000 for HVAC Upgrades at Harris County’s Bayland Community Center

Inaugural “Cooling Communities” Program Launched to Support Local Neighborhoods

 Daikin, a world leading air conditioning manufacturer, is stepping up to the plate again with the Astros Foundation to launch a new annual initiative: Cooling Communities. The program will provide upgraded HVAC systems where they are needed most across the Greater Houston area.

 The first Cooling Communities recipient is Bayland Community Center in Harris County Precinct 4, a vital hub for youth sports, senior programs, and local clubs. Through the program, Bayland will receive $55,000 in HVAC upgrades to help keep the space cool, welcoming, and accessible year-round. Powered by Daikin’s advanced inverter technology, the new system will deliver reliable, energy-efficient indoor climate control that adapts to the needs of the space, enhancing comfort for everyone who walks through Bayland’s doors. As a global leader in HVAC innovation, Daikin is committed to improving indoor environments through sustainable, high-performance solutions that work for any space.

 “Innovation drives us, but community defines us, and we’re proud to give back by putting our world-class technology to work right here in Harris County,” said Kristi Pittman, Senior Vice President of Human Resources at Daikin. “Through the Cooling Communities program with the Astros Foundation, we’re not only enhancing comfort with our advanced HVAC systems, but we’re also investing in the neighborhoods our employees and customers call home, starting in Precinct 4.”

 “Working with Daikin on the Cooling Communities initiative allows us to make a lasting impact where it’s needed most,” said Emelda Douglas, Senior Vice President of Community Affairs for the Houston Astros and Executive Director of the Astros Foundation. “By improving comfort at places like Bayland, we’re helping ensure that every Houstonian has access to welcoming spaces.”

 Bayland is a cornerstone of Harris County Precinct 4’s community programming, offering a wide range of free activities and services for residents of all ages. As a gathering place for youth, seniors, and families alike, Bayland plays a vital role in fostering connection, wellness, and resilience in the area. With Daikin’s advanced HVAC technology now being installed, the center will continue to serve the community in a comfortable indoor environment.

 “Located in Sharpstown, where temperatures can be approximately 10 degrees warmer than other parts of Harris County, the Bayland Community Center serves as a refuge and resource during the hottest days of summer and in times of disaster. The new HVAC system, with the existing backup generator, at Bayland will significantly enhance our resilience to extreme weather, creating protection for our most vulnerable neighbors. Thanks to the support of tremendous organizations like Daikin and the Astros Foundation, we stand ready to serve our residents before, during, and after any storm,” said Harris County Precinct 4 Commissioner Lesley Briones.

 Through community programming and strategic investment, Daikin and the Astros Foundation will continue to work together to bring cool air and warm-hearted support to the places that matter most. Next up, the two organizations will host a youth sports clinic this fall at Daikin Park, the Comfort Zone of the Houston Astros.

 About Houston Astros:

 The Houston Astros are an American professional baseball team based in Houston, Texas. The Astros compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) West Division. Established as the Houston Colt .45s, the Astros entered the National League as an expansion team in 1962. The current name, Houston Astros, reflecting Houston’s role as the host of the Johnson Space Center and space exploration, was adopted three years later, when they moved into the Astrodome. The Astros moved to their current home ballpark in downtown Houston in 2000. The Astros have had great success on the diamond, having won two World Series (2017 and 2022), five league pennants, and advanced to a record-setting seven-straight American League Championship Series, winning four of the last seven American League pennants.

 A tenant of the organization is to give back to the greater Houston community, and that is done through the Astros Foundation, the official 501(c)(3) team charity of the Houston Astros. The foundation seeks to harness the passion of baseball fans to support youth baseball and softball programs, the recognition and honor of our nation’s military, childhood cancer awareness, domestic violence awareness and efforts to reduce homelessness. The cornerstone initiatives include the Community Leaders program, the Astros Youth Academy and the Astros RBI (Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities) Program.
