# Local Expert’s Tips for September is National Recovery Month

Beachway Therapy Center is Working to Turn Awareness into Action

 Clinical experts at West Palm Beach–based Beachway Therapy Center are offering guidance during National Recovery Month to help educate the community on how to support loved ones facing addiction and mental health challenges.

 “Overcoming addiction requires more than willpower – it demands compassionate, evidence-based care tailored to the individual,” says Carrie Carlton, MSW, LPC, LCSW, QS, CCTP, and Vice President of Clinical Services at Beachway Therapy Center. “Sustainable recovery is achieved by healing the whole person—mind, body, and spirit—through proven clinical practices and holistic support.”

 National Recovery Month was established in 1989 as a nationwide initiative that aims to:

 * Promote new, evidence-based treatment and recovery practices, including behavioral health services
* Educate communities about the effectiveness of treatment and recovery support services
* Celebrate the strength and resilience of individuals in recovery
* Acknowledge the dedication of service providers and communities who make recovery in all its forms possible
* Encourage individuals, families, and communities to support those on their journey to recovery

 What You Can Do

 * Learn about recovery through credible resources such as SAMHSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration)
* Listen without judgment if someone opens about their struggles
* Speak Up to challenge stigma and misinformation
* Share Resources such as crisis hotlines or counseling services

 “National Recovery Month is a powerful reminder that healing is possible,” says Carlton. “It’s a profound privilege to walk alongside individuals as they reclaim their lives, and our team is deeply grateful to be part of that transformation.”
