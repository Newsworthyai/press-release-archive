# Intensity Therapeutics Raises $6.6 Million

Intensity Therapeutics, a late-stage clinical biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of novel intratumoral cancer therapies that are designed to kill tumors and increase immune system recognition of cancers using its proprietary non-covalent conjugation technology, announces that in July 2025 the Company added $6.6 million in gross proceeds ($6.3 million net) by selling 19,868,658 shares of its common stock via its At-the-Market offering (the “ATM”) at an average price of $0.3323 per share. Following such sales of common stock pursuant to the ATM, the Company has 46,035,081 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of July 31, 2025.

 “We were able to take advantage of strong liquidity and favorable prices in our stock last month. The proceeds from these ATM sales strengthen our balance sheet considerably and allow us to continue to advance the clinical trials into the second half of 2026,” said Lewis H. Bender, President and CEO of Intensity. “We are also pleased to announce that the average price per share for these ATM sales was more than 10% higher than our recently completed June 2025 public offering, and the costs to raise this incremental capital were much lower. We will continue to be selective and strategic in the deployment of the remainder of the ATM.”

 About At the Market Transactions

 “At-the-Market” (ATM) offerings, also known as “ATM” programs, refer to a method where a public company sells its newly issued shares directly into the existing trading market at the prevailing market price, rather than through a traditional underwritten offering. This approach allows companies to raise capital opportunistically and incrementally, as needed, with minimal disruption to the market and typically lower costs.

 About INT230-6

 INT230-6, Intensity’s lead proprietary investigational product candidate, is designed for direct intratumoral injection. INT230-6 was discovered using Intensity’s proprietary DfuseRx℠ technology platform. The drug consists of two proven, potent anti-cancer agents, cisplatin and vinblastine sulfate, and a diffusion and cell penetration enhancer molecule (“SHAO”) that facilitates the dispersion of potent cytotoxic drugs throughout tumors, allowing the active agents to diffuse into cancer cells. These agents remain in the tumor, resulting in a favorable safety profile. In addition to local disease control and direct tumor killing, INT230-6 causes a release of a bolus of neoantigens specific to the malignancy, leading to immune system engagement and systemic anti-tumor effects. Importantly, these effects are mediated without immunosuppression, which often occurs with systemic chemotherapy.

 About Intensity Therapeutics

 Intensity is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company whose novel engineered chemistry enables aqueous cytotoxic-containing drug formulations to mix and saturate a tumor’s dense, high-fat, pressurized environment following direct intratumoral injection. As a result of the saturation, Intensity’s clinical trials have demonstrated the ability of INT230-6 to kill tumors and elicit an adaptive immune response within days of injection, representing a new approach to cancer cell death that holds the potential to shift the treatment paradigm and turn many deadly cancers into chronic diseases even for malignancies that do not respond to conventional immunotherapy. Intensity has completed two clinical studies and enrolled over 200 patients using INT230-6: a Phase 1/2 dose escalation study in metastatic cancers including sarcomas (NCT03058289), and a Phase 2 randomized control clinical trial in locally advanced breast cancer (the “INVINCIBLE-2 Study”) (NCT04781725) in women without undergoing chemotherapy prior to their surgery. The Company initiated a Phase 3 trial in soft tissue sarcoma (the “INVINCIBLE-3 Study”) (NCT06263231), testing INT230-6 as second or third-line monotherapy compared to the standard of care (“SOC”) with overall survival as an endpoint. Intensity also initiated a Phase 2 study (the “INVINCIBLE-4 Study”) (NCT06358573) in collaboration with the Swiss Cancer Group, formerly the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research, SAKK, as part of a Phase 2/3 program evaluating INT230-6 followed by the SOC immunochemotherapy and the SOC alone for patients with presurgical triple-negative breast cancer. Pathological complete response (“pCR”) is the endpoint.
