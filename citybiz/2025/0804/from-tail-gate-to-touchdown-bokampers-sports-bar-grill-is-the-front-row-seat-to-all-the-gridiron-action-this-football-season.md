 Who/What:

 Bokamper’s Sports Bar & Grill is calling the plays this football season! From a Football Kick-off Tailgate Party to Fantasy Football Draft packages and weekly specials, Bokamper’s is the front-row seat to all the gridiron action.

 Kick off football season in full blitz mode with a full day of festivities at Bokamper’s in Fort Lauderdale with its Football Kick-off Tailgate Party on Saturday, Aug. 23, from 11:30 a.m. to midnight, where the game-day energy starts before the coin toss. This pre-game celebration brings the tailgate to the fans with a live DJ, a cornhole tossing contest for the chance to win a $250 bar tab, spin the wheel raffle prizes, game day grub specials and more. With TVs covering every wall of the restaurant, fans won’t miss the start of the college football season or the final weekend of NFL preseason.

 Fans can huddle up for guest appearances by gridiron greats at 12 p.m., including Bokamper’s own Kim “Bo” Bokamper and the powerhouse Pouncey Twins: Mike Pouncey (Florida Gators, Miami Dolphins and the LA Chargers) and Maurkice Pouncey (Florida Gators and Pittsburgh Steelers). Expect a stacked lineup of additional surprise appearances from fellow athletes and sports personalities throughout the day.

 Guests will be the first to get an exclusive taste of the Pouncey Twins’ brand-new whiskey, Twin P Whiskey. The Pouncey Twins believe a strong family foundation is essential in creating a winning legacy. That belief goes into every handcrafted bottle of Twin P Whiskey, where a blend of strength and flavor combine to create a premium whiskey worthy of the Pouncey family legacy.

 During the event, end zone-worthy food specials for $10 include small Killer B Wings, Kimberly’s Grilled Chicken Quesadilla, sliders and fries, hot dog and fries, chicken tenders and fries, loaded fries, and a giant Bavarian pretzel.
