# Atlanta Property Group Expands Industrial Portfolio with Charlotte, North Carolina Acquisition

Atlanta Property Group, a leading Atlanta real estate investment firm, today announces it has purchased 5416 Wyoming Ave., an 80,000-square-foot, infill distribution building in Charlotte, N.C. The building is the latest addition to APG’s growing industrial portfolio, signaling the firm’s continued focus on investing in key distribution assets in strategic Southeastern markets.

 Situated in the high-performing Westinghouse industrial submarket, 5416 Wyoming Ave. offers institutional-quality functionality in a last-mile location. Constructed in 1998, 5416 Wyoming Ave. features 18’-21’ clear heights, 150’ truck court, dock-high doors, full-building HVAC and heavy power. The building is currently 100% leased.

 “This acquisition represents a strategic investment in one of Charlotte’s most sought-after infill industrial submarkets,” said Smith Haverty, partner at APG. “The Westinghouse submarket benefits from excellent transportation access, strong tenant demand and limited developable land. This deal aligns with our strategy of acquiring functional, well-located industrial assets in high-growth Sun Belt markets.”

 APG is an active participant in the industrial market, acquiring 16 industrial buildings since 2022. As the industrial market continues to experience strong fundamentals, APG plans to invest $150 million of committed equity into existing distribution properties in the Atlanta, Charlotte, Greenville, Savannah, Nashville, Raleigh and Central Florida markets by the end of 2025.
