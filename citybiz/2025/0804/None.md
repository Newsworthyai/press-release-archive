 “AI is rewriting the rules of enterprise technology and with that comes a wave of new, complex security risks,” said Kelley. “What drew me to Noma Security is its clarity of purpose and innovation in AI security. This isn’t just another security platform, it’s a purpose-built foundation for protecting the future of AI. I’m excited to join a team that’s setting the standard for how AI should be secured.”

 Mavi brings more than two decades of experience leading customer success, strategic partnerships, and enterprise transformation at some of the world’s most influential technology companies. Most recently, she served as Global Director of Customer Success at Wiz, where she helped scale one of the fastest-growing cloud security companies. Following that role, she also led customer strategic engagements at Wiz, with a focus on customer satisfaction.
