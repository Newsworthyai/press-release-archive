# Nachawati Law Group Opens Antitrust Practice

Nachawati Law Group, a nationwide plaintiff’s firm based in Dallas, TX, has launched a new antitrust practice designed to help state, local, tribal, and other governments enforce antitrust laws against corporate actors that have harmed free markets and consumers. DOJ Antitrust veteran Michael Kades will lead the nationwide practice, which also includes Attorney Jeff Dan Herrera, former antitrust bureau chief for the State of New Mexico, and Senior Attorney Brian Moore, who previously worked for both the Attorney General of New Mexico and the City of Albuquerque, and who plays an important role in the firm’s existing public entity litigation practice.

 “Our new antitrust practice renews our dedication to fighting corporate injustices on behalf of public clients,” said Nachawati Law Group founder Majed Nachawati. “With a seasoned DOJ veteran like Michael on our team, we will continue to deliver persistent, professional, and trustworthy representation as we build out our antitrust practice group.”

 The firm’s new antitrust practice builds on its Public Entity Litigation Division, which currently represents a variety of governments in consumer protection, data privacy, and other actions nationwide. The addition of antitrust enforcement capabilities to NLG’s existing offerings means a one-stop shop for state, local, regional, and tribal governmental entities to protect themselves and their citizens from corporate wrongdoers.

 “This practice is built for government enforcers, by government enforcers,” said Kades. “As former local, state, and federal enforcers, we appreciate the challenges and interests of public entities. We look forward to being a force multiplier that will help clients across the country effectively enforce the antitrust laws because without competition, we all lose.”

 Kades joins Nachawati Law Group from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division, where he previously served as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General focused on civil enforcement. During his tenure at the DOJ, he supervised enforcement actions in critical areas of the economy, involving dominant firms such as Apple, American Airlines, and Visa. Kades spearheaded the Division’s successful effort to revitalize the Packers and Stockyards Act. Prior to the DOJ, Kades was director for markets and competition policy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. Kades also worked as antitrust counsel for Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), on detail from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). At the FTC, he spent 20 years as an attorney investigating and litigating antitrust actions.

 Joining Kades, Jeff Dan Herrera brings extensive antitrust enforcement experience from his role with the State of New Mexico, where he was part of the multistate coalition that successfully blocked the Kroger-Albertsons merger. To round out the practice, Brian Moore adds his expertise representing state and municipal governments in complex consumer, financial, and antitrust cases.

 Nachawati Law Group represents individuals in mass tort litigation, businesses and governmental entities, and individual victims in complex personal injury litigation. For more information, visit https://ntrial.com.
