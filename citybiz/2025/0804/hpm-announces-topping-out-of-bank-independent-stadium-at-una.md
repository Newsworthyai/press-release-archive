# HPM Announces Topping Out of Bank Independent Stadium at UNA

The multipurpose project is set to host athletic and community events in Florence, Alabama

 Birmingham-based program management firm HPM announced today the topping out of Bank Independent Stadium at the University of North Alabama (UNA), signifying the placement of the final structural beam. HPM is serving as the program manager for the $65 million multipurpose facility on UNA’s campus in Florence, Alabama. The project, which will be the University’s first dedicated stadium, broke ground in June 2024 for an anticipated opening in Fall 2026.

 Bank Independent Stadium will feature Bobby Wallace Field, a three-level press tower with concessions, restrooms, suites, a club level and a “home tunnel” connecting the home locker room to the adjacent Flowers Hall. The venue will redevelop the athletic complex that previously included the UNA turf practice field, Mike D. Lane Field and band practice field, incorporating UNA’s football, baseball and soccer teams and marching band into the reimagined design. In addition to athletic practices and sporting events, Bank Independent Stadium is designed to enrich the city with concerts, live performances and other community events.

 As part of a separate package, HPM will also oversee the addition of a 2,760 square foot video board for the stadium to use during games and community events. This is soon starting construction at the northeast end of the stadium.

 HPM is working closely with UNA to provide specialized services from pre-construction through completion, including oversight of budgeting, scheduling, design management, bidding and construction oversight. The project is split into multiple packages, which required careful sequencing to ensure the practice field was completed before the stadium work began, along with a mass excavation package, which included recessing the football field approximately 15 feet below the existing grade. The excavated dirt was then used as fill material across the site for the future baseball field. This design will provide 360-degree concourse access, allowing fans to circulate the facility without having the stadium structure block their view.

 “Today’s topping out is one of many milestones in the construction of Bank Independent Stadium that UNA and North Alabama Athletics will be celebrating,” said Dr. Josh Looney, Director of Athletics at UNA. “We continue to work closely with our partners at HPM to ensure timelines and each phase fall into place on schedule. Our student-athletes, coaches and staff are eager to use this great facility to enjoy football, soccer and baseball games.”

 This project represents the first partnership between HPM and the University of North Alabama. Additional project partners include Davis Architects as the architect, Ampere as the sports consultant and Fite Building Company as the general contractor for the football stadium package.

 With a presence throughout the U.S. and a total management portfolio value of more than $1 billion annually, HPM has established itself as one of the industry’s leading program managers and owner’s representative companies. The firm’s other notable projects at higher education institutions include Bryant Denny Stadium, Sewell Thomas Stadium, Rhoades Softball Stadium, Hank Crisp Indoor Practice Facility, Coleman Coliseum and Mal M. Moore Athletic Facility at The University of Alabama; Daniel Meyer Coliseum and Lupton Baseball Field at Texas Christian University; The University of Alabama at Birmingham’s Protective Life Stadium; and Texas Tech University’s Jones AT&T East Side Stadium.
