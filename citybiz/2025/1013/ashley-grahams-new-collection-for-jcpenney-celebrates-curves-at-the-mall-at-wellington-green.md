# Ashley Graham’s New Collection for JCPenney Celebrates Curves at The Mall at Wellington Green

JCPenney is proud to announce the launch of the highly anticipated Ashley Graham For JCPenney collection, now available at The Mall at Wellington Green.

 Designed for women who wear sizes 0X–5X and 14W–30W, this inclusive collection is a bold step toward reshaping the fashion industry’s standards. With 41 styles available, this size-forward line is a direct response to the fashion gap where, despite the average American woman wearing a size 14 or above, less than 20% of apparel is made in those sizes.

 JCPenney is flipping the script by partnering with supermodel, entrepreneur, and body positivity advocate Ashley Graham who understands firsthand what it means to feel both fashionable and empowered in every size.

 “This is something I’ve dreamed about for a long time,” said Graham. “JCPenney was a true champion for me right from the very beginning, giving me one of my very first opportunities as a model. Now, to see JCPenney boldly embracing their role as a fashion leader for all body types feels incredibly powerful and inspiring.”

 Each piece in the Ashley Graham For JCPenney collection was crafted under Ashley’s direction to ensure it celebrates the curves and confidence of every woman. Prices start at $40, and the line features elevated wardrobe staples like crisp white poplin shirts, printed mesh tees, faux leather skirts, wide-leg tailored jeans, satin suits, boucle separates, sleek faux leather outerwear, and more.

 The Mall at Wellington Green is located at 10300 W. Forest Hill Blvd., Wellington, FL.
