# Tyler Local Brings Glam to Town with Blo Blow Dry Bar

Blo Blow Dry Bar, North America’s original blow dry bar and blow dry bar franchise, will open its newest bar on October 24th in Tyler. Located at 113 East 8th Street, the new bar will offer guests five signature styles on its hair menu, a la carte options, a variety of hair treatments, plus five signature makeup looks and a section of customized looks to provide endless inspiration. Following the soft opening, the official grand opening will take place on November 20th, giving guests another opportunity to celebrate and experience all that Blo has to offer.

 The new bar is owned and operated by local entrepreneur Sharie Withers, a longtime Tyler resident and owner of a successful insurance agency for 15 years. She was inspired to bring Blo Blow Dry Bar to her hometown after experiencing a blow out while visiting a friend in Colorado. With a growing population moving to Tyler for its low cost of living and vibrant culture, Withers saw an opportunity to introduce a modern, welcoming beauty experience to the community. Located in Tyler’s historic Bergfeld Center, her new Blo Blow Dry Bar is designed to provide effortless glam and become a go-to destination for locals.

 “I was blown away by the Blo experience when I visited a friend’s location in Colorado. It was fun, friendly, and made me feel confident instantly,” said Withers. “I knew Tyler needed something like this. People here want a modern, welcoming place to look and feel their best, and I’m thrilled to bring Blo to our community.”

 For a limited time, the new bar in Tyler will offer a founder’s rate for its signature Mane Squeeze Membership. From October 24–26, all blow outs will be complimentary, with regular pricing for add-on services. The first 50 founding members will receive a special swag bag, with founding memberships priced at just $75. Plus, blow outs are only $34 through November 23rd.

 Blo Blow Dry Bar is on a mission to create a space where people of all ages, ethnicities, and orientations are welcomed, represented, and made to feel gorgeous while emphasizing the need for self-care and wellness. Combining a sophisticated design with a fun and energetic environment, Blo cultivates a seamless and enjoyable experience for guests upon their arrival, during, and after their services.
