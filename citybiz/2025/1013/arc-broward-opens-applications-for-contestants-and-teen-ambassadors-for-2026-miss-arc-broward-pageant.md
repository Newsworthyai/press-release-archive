# Arc Broward Opens Applications for Contestants and Teen Ambassadors for 2026 Miss Arc Broward Pageant

Celebrating 13 years of building confidence and community for women with disabilities

 Arc Broward is pleased to announce the opening of applications for its 13th Annual Miss Arc Broward Pageant. This year, the organization is inviting young women ages 6 to 17 with disabilities to apply as contestants, as well as students to serve as teen ambassadors who will mentor, support and help raise awareness during the pageant season. This inspiring event will take place on Sunday, May 17, 2026, at 2 p.m. at The Parker in Fort Lauderdale.

 The Miss Arc Broward Pageant is more than a competition, it is a celebration of belonging, confidence and self-expression. By participating, contestants join a supportive community where they are empowered to shine, build meaningful connections and strengthen their self-esteem. Teen Ambassadors play a critical role as mentors, advocates, and liaisons between contestants and the public.

 “This pageant is truly about celebrating each girl for who she is,” said Julie Price, CEO of Arc Broward. “The contestants remind us all of the power of courage and self-expression, while teen ambassadors help create lasting bonds of friendship, encouragement and advocacy. We’re excited to officially open applications for next year’s event and can’t wait to welcome a new group of remarkable young women and ambassadors to the Miss Arc Broward family.”

 Participation in the Miss Arc Broward Pageant is completely free, and the experience extends far beyond the stage. Contestants gain self-confidence, participate in group activities and receive professional headshots, swag bags and exciting prizes. Teen Ambassadors, meanwhile, develop leadership skills and play an active role in promoting inclusion as contestants prepare for the big day, and both teen ambassadors and cheer squads can earn school volunteer service hours for their participation.

 Get Involved

 Teens are encouraged to register to become a Pageant Ambassador to help create a magical experience for pageant participants. Through special events, activities, rehearsals and on pageant day, teen ambassadors will foster belonging and help pageant contestants feel supported.

 In addition, school, youth and community groups are encouraged to form a Cheer Squad to support pageant participants from the audience on pageant day.

 Sponsorship opportunities are available for individuals and businesses interested in showcasing their support. To learn more about sponsorship opportunities, please contact David Perez at dperez@arcbroward.com.

 Applications for contestants and teen ambassadors are due by December 15. For more information or to submit an application, visit https://arcbroward.com/miss-arc-broward/.
