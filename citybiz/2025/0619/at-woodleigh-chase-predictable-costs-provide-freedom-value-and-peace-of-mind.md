# At Woodleigh Chase, Predictable Costs Provide Freedom, Value, and Peace of Mind

When Barbara and Robert Cohen decided to move back to Virginia after retiring to Pennsylvania in 2011, they started exploring their senior living options.

 The financial stability and vibrant, worry-free lifestyle offered at Woodleigh Chase, an Erickson Senior Living community in Fairfax, Va., caught their eye.

 Thanks to a streamlined pricing structure that covers maintenance costs and more, residents can manage their budgets with confidence. Woodleigh Chase also boasts convenient activities and amenities, like a fitness center, swimming pool, and restaurants, making it easy for residents to pursue an engaging retirement.

 “Our oldest daughter was thrilled when we told her that we were moving to Woodleigh Chase,” Barbara says. “We have everything we need here, both now and in the future.”

 Predictable costs

 Woodleigh Chase’s pricing structure has two components: the monthly service package and the 80% refundable entrance fee.*

 The monthly service package bundles the costs of all utilities; maintenance, including appliance repair and replacement; a meal plan at multiple on-site restaurants; trash and recycling collection; and regularly scheduled local transportation into one predictable bill.

 The package supports the more than 90% of seniors who say they want predictable monthly expenses to cover most of their daily activities, meals, and housing–according to a recent survey commissioned by Erickson Senior Living via Edge Research.

 “By consolidating all of your household bills into one consistent monthly service package, you can eliminate the stress of unexpected costs and gain greater confidence in your budget,” says Greg Freeman, director of finance for Woodleigh Chase. “From a financial perspective, Woodleigh Chase truly is worry-free living.”

 “It’s much easier to receive one bill each month rather than multiple bills for each service,” notes Barbara. “Plus, we don’t have to worry about anything. Over the winter, we never had to stress over shoveling or damage to our home. If something needs to be fixed in the apartment, we just call maintenance, and they will take care of it.”

 Peace of mind

 The heart of the community’s pricing structure is the 80% refundable entrance fee. The entrance fee, collected as part of the residency process, will go back to you or your beneficiaries, if or when you leave the community.

 And because the entrance fee is unique to each residence’s features, living at the sought-after community is more accessible than many people realize.

 Many residents also appreciate Woodleigh Chase’s Home for Life promise.* No one ever expects to run out of money, but sometimes unforeseen issues arise that can quickly deplete your hard-earned savings and put you at risk. Woodleigh Chase is prepared to assist eligible residents who outlive their resources. No one will be asked to leave our community because of a genuine inability to pay.

 “Living here gives us peace of mind,” says Barbara. “We have given our children a valuable gift, because they will never have to worry about us.”

 Delivering value

 Freeman adds notes that additional value comes from the community’s amenities and services, which continue to evolve over time to meet current and future residents’ needs.

 “The key to delivering exceptional value lies in our investment in top-notch amenities,” says Freeman.

 Barbara and Robert love the view of the bocce courts from the screened porch attached to their residence.

 However, thanks to the range of amenities and activities available, they don’t spend nearly as much time at home as they thought they would.

 So much to do

 “This is an active community with a vibrant social atmosphere, and there is always something going on,” says Barbara. “I volunteer as a resident ambassador, and I’m learning how to play mah-jongg. We also enjoy attending concerts.”

 She adds, “I’ve heard other residents refer to Woodleigh Chase as a cruise ship that never leaves the dock, and I completely agree. I believe we get great value for our money here!”
