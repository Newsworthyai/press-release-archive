# Boca Helping Hands Annual “Bowling for Bread” Supported the Organization’s Backpacks Weekend Meal Program

Boca Helping Hands (BHH) held its annual Bowling for Bread event on August 24 at Lucky Strike in Boca Raton. BHH brought kids from local children’s charities to attend at no cost to enjoy an afternoon of bowling, food, and fun. Proceeds from the event supported the organization’s Backpacks weekend meal program for kids in area schools.

 The children’s charities that participated included 4KIDS of South Florida, Inc., Achievement Centers for Children & Families, Adopt a Family of the Palm Beaches, Inc., American Association of Caregiving Youth, Boys & Girls Club of Boca Raton, Family Promise of South Palm Beach County, Fuller Center, HomeSafe, Place of Hope, PROPEL, and Pearl City Cats.

 Boca Helping Hands has operated the BHH Backpacks children’s meal program for the past 14 years, providing food-insecure students with non-perishable, easy-to-prepare meals every Friday to ensure they get enough to eat on the weekends. During the 2024-25 school year, BHH Backpacks helped over 1,381 students in 15 local schools, providing 36,853 weekend meal boxes and 73,506 snacks to elementary students in Boca Raton, Delray Beach, and Boynton Beach.

 

 Bowling for Bread was part of Boca Chamber Festival Days—a series of fun-filled August events intended to raise awareness and funds by pairing nonprofits with for-profit members of the Greater Boca Raton Chamber of Commerce. Ovation Home Insurance Exchange was Bowling for Bread’s For-Profit Chamber Partner, and the Event Sponsor was the Lee Pearlson Steinberg Foundation. Other major sponsors included the Gary Peters Family Foundation, and Humana Heathy Horizons in Florida.

 This was the Lee Pearlson Steinberg Foundation’s 14th year sponsoring the event. “Being part of the fun at Bowling for Bread and seeing the kids enjoy themselves is something I look forward to every year, “said Foundation Trustee Lee Steinberg. “My mom Pearl’s love for children’s causes inspired me to support Bowling for Bread in her memory. It’s a wonderful way to honor her legacy.”
