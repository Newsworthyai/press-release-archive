# Outdoor Personia Launches “Operation: Shed for a Vet” Campaign to Honor Local Veterans

Outdoor Personia, a New England-based builder of personalized outdoor living structures, is proud to announce the launch of its latest charitable initiative, “Operation: Shed for a Vet.” As part of its ongoing commitment to community service, the company is inviting the public to nominate a deserving United States veteran to receive a free, quality-built, 8’ x 12’ storage shed.

 “This is our way of saying thank you,” said Marcus Wenger, founder of Outdoor Personia. “We want to recognize and honor a veteran who has served our country – and could really use the extra space or support at home.”

 The public is encouraged to submit nominations through the Outdoor Personia website. Whether it’s a veteran neighbor, friend, or family member, the company wants to hear their story and learn why they deserve this gift.

 The winner will receive a ready-made, professionally designed storage shed, ready for delivery by Veterans Day from Outdoor Personia. There is no cost to nominate, and all materials, labor, and delivery are being donated by the company.

 This special campaign builds on Outdoor Personia’s broader tradition of giving back. Every year, the company pauses operations for its Annual Days of Service, where staff volunteer their skills to support local homeowners and organizations in need. “Our mission has always been about more than outdoor structures,” said Wenger. “It’s about building community.”
