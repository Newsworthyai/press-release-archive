# Local Couple Debuts Two New Perspire Sauna Studio Locations in Birmingham and Novi

A science-backed wellness business that promises to make you sweat opened on July 18 in Birmingham. Located inside the newly developed Birmingham Pointe building at 1020 Haynes Street, the biggest development in the city in more than 40 years, the local owners of the new Perspire Sauna Studio, the country’s largest sauna studio franchise, serve the local area by providing a unique wellness experience. With its addition of the state-of-the-art SNØ Shower, the brand now offers contrast therapy, combining full-spectrum infrared sauna and red-light therapy technology to detox the body, burn calories, improve sleep, ease pain, and more.

 The Birmingham studio is owned and operated by Stephanie and Rami Ubaydi, Oakland County residents and wellness-focused entrepreneurs who brought Michigan’s first Perspire Sauna Studio to Rochester Hills in 2023. Stephanie has a background in marketing, fitness, and community volunteerism, while Rami brings more than three decades of experience as a healthcare executive. Together, they’re growing their footprint with a third studio coming soon to Novi.

 “Birmingham and Novi are the perfect next chapters for our journey,” said Stephanie. “Our guests in Rochester Hills have shown us how much people are craving innovative, technology-backed wellness solutions. We’re proud to bring this transformative experience to entirely new neighborhoods and continue building a community focused on self-care and healing.”

 The 722-square-foot studio features nine private infrared sauna suites, three SNØ Showers, and the premium hospitality and wellness services that have made the Ubaydis’ Rochester Hills location one of the busiest in the country.

 Birmingham-area residents can visit the new Perspire Sauna Studio to learn about and experience the benefits of infrared saunas and red-light therapy firsthand. The franchise is intent on giving members an immersive infrared sauna experience through use of the latest in red-light therapy technology; providing concierge-level service and premium amenities to ensure a transformative sauna session.
