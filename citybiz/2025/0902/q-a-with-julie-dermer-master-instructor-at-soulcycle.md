# Q&amp;A with Julie Dermer, Master Instructor at SoulCycle

Meet Julie Dermer, a longtime Master Instructor at SoulCycle, lifestyle influencer, and leader in the fitness space.

 What first inspired you to pursue the career path you’re on today, your work with Soul Cycle, and did you always envision yourself doing this kind of work?

 I found my way to SoulCycle in the most organic way. I’d been a rider since the very first studio opened in 2007, and from my very first class I was hooked. The transformative benefits were undeniable, and before long I started imagining myself on the podium, leading a room. As my 40th birthday approached, I was craving a new and exciting personal challenge—so I decided to audition. Until then, I had never seriously considered a career in fitness, but in that moment it just felt so right, so aligned, and so thrilling.

 What values or philosophies guide your work, and how do you bring them into your day-to-day practice?

 The values and philosophies I bring to every class are rooted in tapping into that uninhibited version of ourselves. My goal is to both support and challenge riders in a way that reminds them that success is defined by them—and no one else. I want every rider to leave feeling powerful and accomplished, whether it’s their very first class or their hundredth. For me, it’s all about the effort, paired with pure gratitude for the ability to show up and do what we do.

 What has been the most challenging aspect of your career so far, and how has it helped you grow both personally and professionally?

 The most challenging part of my 14 years at SoulCycle has been keeping my classes fresh and exciting. Music is a huge part of that—I’m always on the hunt for new tracks and remixes. I constantly evolve the flow of class and the cueing I give, so no two rides ever feel the same. The Soul bike itself is such an extraordinary piece of equipment, and lately I’ve been layering in more strength work on the bike and resistance challenges to keep riders pushing past their limits and building strength.

 Thinking about how to evolve my classes has also inspired me to evolve personally. I train with a coach, take classes, and push myself outside the studio so I can show up strong for my riders. I’m fueled by the motivation I get from watching other incredible instructors out there raising the bar in the fitness world.

 How do you maintain balance between your career, personal life, and self-care, especially given the energy you pour into your work?

 Keeping balance in my personal and professional life really comes down to self-care. If I want to show up for the fun stuff—and be present for my kids and husband—I know I can’t overdo it. I try to be mindful of where my energy goes and make time for the things that “fill my tank” instead of drain it. Pilates, yoga, and sculpt always make me feel amazing. And honestly, nothing beats early dinners with friends, a night at the theatre, or even a little overnight spa escape. Those moments keep me grounded, happy, and ready for it all.

 How has your career evolved over time, and in what ways have you surprised yourself along the way?

 I started this career at 40, while raising two young kids and juggling other jobs. It took time to find my voice, but with every class, I’ve grown more confident and clear in my style. My story has always been about uncovering strength you didn’t know you had—and that’s exactly what I want riders to feel. Soul helped me find my way to the podium, and it keeps pushing me to grow every single day.

 No matter how I’m feeling, the moment I clip in and put on my mic, I feel like my most free and confident self. And as I get older and wiser, the class continues to evolve right along with me.

 What are your goals or dreams for the next chapter of your career, and what excites you most about what’s ahead?

 I’d love to keep teaching for as long as I can. I also really enjoy sharing both work and life experiences on social media—my followers feel like family, and we’ve been through so much together, from COVID to empty nesting. I’ve shared it all. I think there’s something inspiring and comforting about seeing people you trust open up with both vulnerabilities and ideas that can truly make an impact. I’m also excited to be returning to coach at Weight Watchers and to collaborate again with my friend Julie Rice, the founder of SoulCycle. At the heart of it, I love doing anything that empowers people—especially women.

 For someone aspiring to follow a similar path, what’s the one piece of advice you wish you had when you were starting out in the fitness space?

 Trust yourself, and the path that led you to this moment. Be confident in delivering an experience that people are so grateful and excited to receive. You don’t have to overcomplicate it—just keep it simple, keep it real, and let your authenticity shine.
