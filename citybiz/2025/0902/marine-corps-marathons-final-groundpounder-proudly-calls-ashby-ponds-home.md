# Marine Corps Marathon’s Final ‘Groundpounder’ Proudly Calls Ashby Ponds Home

Before moving to Ashby Ponds, an Erickson Senior Living community in Ashburn, Va., retired U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Al Richmond earned the remarkable distinction of becoming the Marine Corps Marathon’s longest running “Groundpounder”–a nickname given to someone who has completed every Marine Corps Marathon since the 26.2-mile race began in 1976.

 “There were several others like me wanting to run in each race. At first, my goal was to not be the first one to break the streak,” he says.

 Not only did he keep up the streak, he was also the last to do so. Al became the final Groundpounder to retire from the race, following the 42nd annual run on October 22, 2017.

 He ran alongside his daughter Elisa in his last four marathons, and he was cheered on by his loving wife Kitty, their six adult children, fifteen grandchildren, and a host of supportive friends during his 42 years as a Groundpounder.

 “We are all so proud of Al’s dedication and perseverance,” says Kitty. “His races were always big family events. We’d all get together for a pasta dinner before each race, cheer him on along the route, and wait for him at the finish line.”

 Running toward fate Al’s passion for long distance running began, unexpectedly, with a conversation in the Pentagon locker room.

 “I had just finished one of our mandatory three-mile runs when one of my fellow Marines came in from a ten-mile run, and I thought, ‘I can do that.’ That’s how it all began,” he recalls.

 At the time, the Marine Corps was preparing for the first marathon–the Marine Corps Reserves Marathon, as it was called for the first two years. Al, experienced in data processing, volunteered to prepare race tabulations, but he was also determined to run the race.

 The first marathon, held on November 7, 1976, saw 1,000 runners cross the finish line. Since then, the race has grown into one of the largest in the world, hosting over 30,000 runners from all fifty states and more than fifty countries.

 In addition to running the marathon’s first 42 races, Al completed ten additional marathons, including three Boston Marathon finishes.

 One for the record books Al’s most memorable race was the Marine Corps Marathon in November 1990, which he ran less than six months after being seriously injured while attending the Jazz Fest in New Orleans.

 “In September, as I was recovering, I read an article in the paper about a guy who was bragging that he had run in every Marine Corps Marathon. I thought, ‘Shoot, now I have to,'” he recalls.

 Determined, Al made the most out of the next six weeks and stood at the starting line, ready to race, on November 4, 1990.

 “It was his hardest race to complete, making it the most memorable,” says Kitty. “It is really remarkable what he had to overcome–to not only get there, but to cross the finish line.”

 New chapter Following his final Marine Corps Marathon in 2017, Al and Kitty began making plans for a vibrant, carefree retirement. Their good friends David and Janice Mitchell lived at Ashby Ponds, so they decided to explore the community.

 “Dave and Janice were a big reason we moved to Ashby Ponds. They had previously enjoyed a great life in Fairfax, and they raved about the community, so we respected their opinion,” says Kitty. “What we discovered is that once you see Ashby Ponds, you fall in love. There’s just so much here! From the restaurants to all the activities.”

 Moving to Ashby Ponds meant selling the house that Al’s grandmother built in Arlington, Va., in 1910. “Leaving it was a big decision, but it’s one we’ve never regretted,” notes Kitty.

 “We’ve been happy since we moved in,” agrees Al. “Everyone is very friendly, and there is always a lot to do.”

 In fact, shortly after moving in, the couple discovered that their next-door neighbor was sworn into the U.S. Coast Guard in the 1960s by Al’s father, Alfred C. Richmond, a former four-star admiral and commandant.

 “It’s amazing the connections we’ve made,” says Kitty. “And we are so pleased to continue to take part in many of the activities we enjoyed prior to our move, including trips to Nationals Park, concerts, and lectures. I wasn’t sure if we would miss city life, but we aren’t missing anything! Life at Ashby Ponds is fantastic.”

 “Yes, we are very, very happy here,” says Al.
