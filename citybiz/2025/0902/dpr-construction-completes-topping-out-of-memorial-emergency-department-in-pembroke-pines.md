# DPR Construction Completes Topping Out of Memorial Emergency Department in Pembroke Pines

The South Florida Business Unit of DPR Construction, one of the nation’s top technical builders, has wrapped up the first phase of construction of Memorial Healthcare System’s new state-of-the-art 30,000-square-foot free standing emergency department (FSED) located at 801 S. Douglas Road in Pembroke Pines. The official topping out of the building’s structural steel was completed in August.

 The facility, which replaces the current 24/7 Care Center, will include 20 exam and treatment rooms, a pediatric treatment area, 16 fast-track exam rooms, diagnostic imaging such as x-ray and CT, as well as a full-service lab to support all diagnostic procedures. A new parking lot has been completed and, once the new building is complete, the existing urgent care building, which will remain open during construction, will be demolished and replaced with a new parking lot. The facility is scheduled to be fully operational by May 2026.

 “This facility is projected to care for approximately 55,000 individuals each year, with room for future growth,” said Shane Strum, Memorial Healthcare System’s interim CEO. “Designed to staff adult emergency medical as well as pediatric emergency medical physicians, it is equipped to meet diverse emergency needs and to provide essential care to the many communities that trust us with their health.”

 “The challenges of a multi-phase project on an active campus have enabled the DPR team to incorporate cutting edge Lean construction processes,” said Lee Kinzel, a senior project manager at DPR. “By applying these techniques, we’ve been able to maintain momentum and properly plan the job.”

 DPR is constructing another FSED for Memorial in Miramar, at Miramar Parkway and Red Road, that also is planned to open in 2026. For both projects, DPR was able to tackle ongoing labor challenges and create greater efficiencies by handling of some scopes with their inhouse self-perform team.

 Celebrating its 20th anniversary in South Florida, DPR and its more than 100 local employees handle approximately $260 million in construction projects per year throughout Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties.
