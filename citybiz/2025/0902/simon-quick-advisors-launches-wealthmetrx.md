# Simon Quick Advisors Launches WealthMetrx

Simon Quick Advisors, a national independent wealth management and multi-family office firm, announced today the launch of WealthMetrx, a proprietary service designed to help clients better understand their tax landscape and uncover opportunities for greater efficiency and strategic alignment.

 WealthMetrx delivers a visual, multi-year analysis of a client’s tax profile by evaluating previously filed federal and state returns and comparing them to a curated peer group of high-net-worth individuals. The result: a deeper, data-driven understanding of how income sources, charitable giving, and major life events impact a client’s effective tax rate over time.

 “This is about turning complexity into clarity,” said Christopher Moore, Managing Partner at Simon Quick Advisors. “WealthMetrx empowers our clients to make smarter, forward-looking decisions by giving them better visibility into how their tax strategy is performing—and what they could be doing differently.”

The launch reflects Simon Quick’s planning-first philosophy and collaborative approach. The firm works alongside each client’s existing CPA or tax preparer to uncover insights that support more informed decisions. WealthMetrx does not replace a tax professional—it enhances their work by bringing strategic context and a visual benchmark to the planning process.

 “Our clients often ask, ‘How do I compare to others in my situation?’ or ‘Am I missing anything?’ WealthMetrx answers those questions with clarity and confidence,” said Christopher B. Moore, CFP®, Managing Partner at Simon Quick Advisors. “It’s a powerful tool for identifying gaps, maximizing charitable impact, and aligning financial decisions with long-term goals.”

 Available exclusively to Simon Quick clients, WealthMetrx is now live and continues the firm’s tradition of investing in solutions that deliver personalized, data-informed advice.
