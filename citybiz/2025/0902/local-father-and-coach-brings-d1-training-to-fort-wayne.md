# Local Father and Coach Brings D1 Training to Fort Wayne

D1 Training, a leading fitness enrichment concept utilizing the five core tenets of athletic-based training, recently opened a new location in Fort Wayne at 9307 Illinois Rd. The group fitness facility employs a sports-science backed training regimen led by certified trainers to help people of all ages achieve their sport and fitness goals.

 Local owner Matt Dressler joins a roster of impressive existing franchisees, including professional athletes like Kylie Fitts and Jordan Gay. Additional D1 partners include NBA star Chris Paul and Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow.

 Dressler has always been an athlete, having made a name for himself playing collegiate basketball at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). Following his graduation, Dressler transitioned from the basketball court to the corporate world and continues to hold a successful career in the engineering industry. But his passion for basketball did not diminish following his undergraduate career. While in Cincinnati pursuing a PhD in Biomechanical Engineering, Dressler began coaching a local high school basketball team and has continued to coach at the college and high school level for more than 20 years. For the last three years, Dressler has been the assistant boys’ basketball coach at Canterbury High School, helping lead them to a State Championship in 2024.

 “Some of my best memories from college come from being part of a team that worked hard, overcame challenges, and grew stronger together,” said Dressler. “That’s what I see in D1 Training. It’s not just about individual goals — it’s about building a community where athletes and coaches support each other and grow together. Whether it’s a young athlete learning strong fundamentals, an advanced athlete striving for the next level, or an adult pursuing a personal fitness goal, D1 provides the structure and support to help them succeed.”

 D1 Training offers four age-based programs including Rookie (ages 7-11), Developmental (ages 12-14), Prep (ages 15-18) and D1 Adult. Each fitness program is based on the five athletic-based tenets: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down. Outside of group workouts, D1 Training offers group, semi-private, and one-on-one training with world-class coaches. The goal is simple: to continue to train athletes who are dedicated to their sport or fitness goals, regardless of age, or athletic background.
