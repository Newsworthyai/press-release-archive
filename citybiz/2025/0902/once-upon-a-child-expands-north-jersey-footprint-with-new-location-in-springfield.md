# Once Upon A Child Expands North Jersey Footprint with New Location in Springfield

Once Upon A Child®, the leading children’s clothing and accessories retail resale concept, recently opened its location in Springfield at 275 US-22 East Unit A. The brand is known for providing local parents with a place that not only puts cash back into their pockets, but sells gently used children’s clothing, shoes, toys, accessories and equipment for less.

 With a focus on being a sustainable shopping resource for local families, the new Once Upon A Child in Springfield opened on June 26. Once Upon A Child is part of Winmark – the Resale Company®, a unique national retail resale franchise that focuses on sustainability, small business formation and providing Resale for Everyone®.

 Meet the Local Owners

 The new location is owned by local parents Jaime Silberman and Jessica Watkins. The couple became familiar with Once Upon A Child while shopping for clothing and gear for their growing toddler. Silberman, who spent 30 years in the textile industry, began exploring franchise opportunities and saw the potential in expanding Once Upon A Child’s presence in North Jersey. Silberman and Watkins knew the Springfield community would benefit from a new store closer to home.

 “As parents, we understand how fast kids outgrow their clothing, gear and toys; it can feel like a never-ending cycle,” said Watkins. “That is why Once Upon A Child is such a great resource in the community. Families can come to update their children’s wardrobes and toys as they grow, all without putting anything in landfills.”

 More about Once Upon A Child Springfield

 Once Upon A Child’s unique retail resale concept allows for clothing, toys and accessories for kids to end up in someone else’s house rather than thrown into a landfill, providing a resource for new or existing parents who are looking to update their children’s closet on a budget and in a mindful environmental manner.

 Unlike a typical consignment store, Once Upon A Child does not require appointments and pays on the spot for items it purchases from consumers. At Once Upon A Child families are able to buy necessities for their children at great values, and turn their gently used items into cash.

 In addition, Once Upon A Child ensures that all products purchased and sold meet mandatory and voluntary safety standards. Staff members stay up-to-date on current recalled items, immediately pulling all recalled products from shelves and making sure all items purchased are safety-checked to meet current standards.
