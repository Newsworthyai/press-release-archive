 Meet the Local Franchise Owner:

 The new bar is owned and operated by local entrepreneur and Atlanta native Jasmine Budhwani. Raised in Decatur by business-savvy parents who immigrated from India, Budhwani grew up learning the ins and outs of entrepreneurship from a young age. After earning a business degree from Mercer University and building a successful career that includes banking and owning gas stations, grocery stores, and hotels, Budhwani found a new calling – and this time it was within the beauty and wellness sector.

 While in Houston for her brother’s wedding, she discovered Blo Blow Dry Bar and instantly fell in love with the experience. “I walked out of my appointment feeling amazing, beautiful, confident, and genuinely appreciated,” she recalls. “That moment stuck with me, and I knew I wanted to bring that same feeling to women in my own community.”

 Blo Blow Dry Bar Dunwoody will be more than a beauty destination, it will be a space where hardworking women can finally put themselves first. Budhwani, a new mother herself, deeply understands the need for self-care and is passionate about making it accessible to the working-class women within her community. The business will create 10–15 new local jobs and is the first of three Blo locations she plans to open across Georgia.

 With a strong desire to give back, she’s actively seeking partnerships with female-focused charities, women’s support organizations, and community initiatives. “So many women spend their lives taking care of others,” Jasmine says. “I want to create a place where they can come in, be celebrated, and leave feeling like the best version of themselves because they deserve that.”

 To celebrate the opening, guests can take advantage of the following special offers:

 * Discounted Blowouts: Purchase a single blowout for $45 (offer valid from Sept. 12 to Oct. 12).
* Additional Promotions: VIP Complimentary Services for VIP guests on feel good upgrades (add-ons).
