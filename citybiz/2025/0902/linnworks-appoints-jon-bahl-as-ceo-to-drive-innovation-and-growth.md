# Linnworks Appoints Jon Bahl as CEO to Drive Innovation and Growth

Linnworks, the global leading connected commerce ops platform, today announced the appointment of Jon Bahl as its new Chief Executive Officer.

 Bahl, a highly respected executive with more than 25 years’ experience in strategic leadership, will oversee Linnworks’ global operations and growth strategy, guiding the company through its next phase of expansion.

 Amid mounting pressures on global retail, including supply chain disruption, rising tariffs, and increasing operational complexity, Linnworks has appointed Bahl to strengthen its market position and lead the business through its next phase of development. Linnworks supports retailers and brands to manage inventory and orders lifecycle across multiple channels, integrating with marketplaces, logistics partners and shipping providers. Trusted by over 4,000 global customers, the platform supports over $24 billion USD in annual GMV, enabling fast, reliable fulfilment and operational efficiency, making it the go-to solution for connected commerce at scale.

 Bahl brings a proven track record in leading organisations to achieve significant growth. He has held CEO roles at Preparis and Agility Recovery, where he focused on business continuity, resilience and technology-driven solutions. His earlier leadership roles at Social Solutions (now Bonterra) and private equity firm LLR Partners further underscore his experience in driving sustainable commercial success amid global uncertainty.

 As he takes the helm, Jon Bahl shares his vision, “Linnworks is at a pivotal point in its evolution, well-positioned to scale in a retail environment that’s constantly shifting. To lead in this space, operational excellence and tight execution are non-negotiable, but they must go hand-in-hand with a people-centric culture and a strong, healthy organisation.”

 “I believe in creating the conditions where teams can thrive, where the pipeline is clear and focused, and where growth is intentional and sustainable. Linnworks exists to simplify commerce for everyone in the ecosystem, and I’m energised to take our customers, our people, and our platform to the next level.”

 “We’re thrilled to welcome Jon as CEO of Linnworks at such a pivotal moment in the company’s journey,” said Grant Schachter, a Principal at Marlin Equity Partners. “Linnworks is entering a new phase of transformation and scale, and Jon brings the leadership, vision, and operational discipline needed to drive that forward. We’re excited to support him and the leadership team as they unlock the next chapter of growth and innovation.”
