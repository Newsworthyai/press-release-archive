# Launch the Lantern Dinner: A Night of Reflection, Tradition, and Community at Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens

On August 17, Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens hosted a sold out Launch the Lantern Dinner, an exclusive fundraiser celebrating the meaningful Japanese tradition of Obon.

 Under a twilight sky and surrounded by Morikami’s tranquil gardens, 120 guests gathered for an unforgettable night of remembrance, culture, and connection. The annual event also marked a moving tribute to lost loved ones while raising vital support for the museum’s ongoing mission through the 4-E’s: Education, Exhibitions, Emotional Well-Being Program, and Expansion.

 The evening began on the terrace with hors d’oeuvres and a sake and whiskey tasting. Later, guests were invited to decorate personal lanterns with messages to departed loved ones, honoring the spirit of Obon—when families symbolically welcome the spirits of their ancestors and guide them safely back to the afterlife.

 An elegant dinner and dessert were served, accompanied by curated sake tastings, allowing guests to savor authentic flavors. As darkness fell, subtle and meditative taiko drumming by Fushu Daiko accompanied by shakuhachi (Japanese flute) set the stage for the emotional centerpiece of the evening’s program.

 Over 100 lanterns from the evening’s attendees were gently released onto Morikami Lake, casting a golden glow over the water, and creating a breathtaking visual of love, loss, and unity.

 The Launch the Lantern Dinner stood as a powerful reminder of the beauty of tradition and strength of community – an evening that united remembrance with hope while supporting Morikami’s mission to inspire through Japanese culture.

 Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens is located at 4000 Morikami Park Road, Delray Beach. For more information, call (561) 495-0233 or visit morikami.org.
