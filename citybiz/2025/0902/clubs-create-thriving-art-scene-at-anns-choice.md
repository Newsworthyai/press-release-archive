# Clubs Create Thriving Art Scene at Ann’s Choice

Ann’s Choice, an Erickson Senior Living community in Bucks County, Pa., is home to more than just maintenance-free residences. It also boasts a vibrant, growing arts scene.

 With a variety of creative groups like the Village Potters, stained glass club, Ann’s Choice Art Club, and more, residents have plenty of opportunities to pick up old hobbies–or try something totally new.

 From curiosity to clay “When we moved here, I thought, ‘This is the time to try new things,'” says Rich Grafius, who moved to Ann’s Choice with his wife Linda almost three years ago.

 “I had no experience with pottery, but the first week we were here, I walked by the pottery studio, peeked inside, and was invited right in,” he recalls. “I hesitated at first, but then I turned around and said yes. That one yes turned into a new passion.”

 Now, Rich helps lead the Village Potters, a group that meets twice a week to work on pieces and encourages newcomers to try hand building with clay.

 “Most of the pieces you see in our showcase were made by people who had never touched clay before,” Rich says.

 In addition to hand building, the pottery studio includes opportunities for wheel throwing and decorating. Advanced members even pitch in on the technical side–Rich oversees kiln firing.

 With dues just $5 a month, which covers unlimited clay and glaze, it’s an affordable hobby that also supports the self-sufficient club.

 For Rich, the rewards go beyond the creative process. “People come for the pottery, but they stay for the friendships,” he says. “We talk while we work–about our projects, about life. It’s a safe, supportive place where laughter is common and everyone feels like they belong.”

 Teaching others Another group of artists creating unique, stunning pieces is the stained glass club.

 John Fansmith, who joined the club after moving to Ann’s Choice in 2020, is now known around the community as “the stained glass guy.”

 “Doing stained glass here has helped me become more involved,” says John. “People see me working and stop to ask questions. It opens up conversations and connections.”

 Eager to share his passion with others, John teaches new club members who have little or no experience with stained glass. “Everyone who has come as a student leaves with a piece of stained glass that they have finished,” he says. “It’s a very intense and intricate art form, but also incredibly rewarding.”

 Joan Garber, one of the club’s first members, learned to work with stained glass prior to moving to Ann’s Choice. Now, she repairs stained glass items for neighbors and makes new pieces for family members.

 “It makes my family happy when I give them a little gift. I enjoy that,” Joan says.

 The club also organizes month-long showcase displays in the Keystone Clubhouse. “The variety of work being done is so interesting–everyone has their own style,” John says. “It’s inspiring to see the uniqueness in each piece.”

 Art is for everyone The Ann’s Choice Art Club, which meets every Thursday morning, draws both seasoned artists and beginners.

 “Our policy is that everyone is capable of doing something,” says resident Mary Ann Weisser, who coleads the club with neighbor Charlie Lester. “Many people come to us having never painted or drawn before, and now they’re thriving.”

 Mary Ann, who studied at the Art Students League of New York and later at Temple University, brings decades of experience to the group–and a deep belief that art is for everyone.

 “Art is what you, yourself, feel. There’s no right or wrong,” she says. “We encourage people to explore different mediums–watercolor, pencil, acrylic, mixed media. We even offer themed challenges and showcases so residents can display their work.”

 ‘Time to do what I love’ Linda, an experienced artist who works with stained glass, clay, paint, and pen and ink, notes that Ann’s Choice has allowed her to strengthen her existing talents and expand into new mediums.

 “I probably do art in some form every day here at Ann’s Choice,” she says, with a laugh. “Because we don’t have the responsibilities of a house anymore, I have the time to do what I love.”

 She adds, “People are making beautiful things, and they’re learning from each other every step of the way. We have people discovering talents in their 70s, 80s, and 90s! This community gives them the time, space, and encouragement to do it.”

 Rich agrees, saying, “The best part about living here? My days are filled with things I want to do, not things I have to do.”
