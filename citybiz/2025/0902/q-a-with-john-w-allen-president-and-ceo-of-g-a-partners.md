# Q&amp;A with John W. Allen, President and CEO of G&amp;A Partners

John W. Allen is the president and CEO of G&A Partners, a leading national professional employer organization (PEO) and HR outsourcing (HRO) provider. He oversees the company’s daily operations and plays a key role in guiding its strategic direction and long-term growth.

 Before co-founding G&A Partners with Tony Grijalva in 1995, John served as a consulting partner at Grant Thornton. Since then, G&A has grown significantly, now supporting more than 4,400 clients and 120,000 worksite employees nationwide. This success has been driven by both organic expansion and strategic acquisitions, including the recent acquisition of GrowthForce, a top-tier outsourced accounting firm.

 John is committed to continuing this trajectory by identifying new growth opportunities, pursuing strategic acquisitions, and delivering innovative solutions that help clients stay ahead of their evolving HR needs.

 For those who are unfamiliar with G&A Partners, can you tell us about the company?

 G&A Partners is a professional employer organization (PEO) and human resources outsourcing (HRO) company. We offer a range of services to help businesses manage HR functions, including payroll, benefits administration, HR management, and risk management. Headquartered in Houston, G&A Partners has offices throughout the U.S. and recently celebrated 30 years in business.

 Wow, 30 years is a huge milestone. What is the cornerstone to your success?

 When we started the company, we never imagined the extraordinary growth we have achieved today, and it all comes back to the exceptional people who have been with us on this journey. Our team’s collective dedication has been the driving force behind our shared success, and it’s incredibly rewarding to reflect on all we’ve accomplished over the past three decades.

 You mentioned G&A’s growth. You’ve completed 16 acquisitions in the last seven years. Is M&A the main way for the company to continue to grow?

 There are three main ways for a PEO to grow. The first is organic growth, this needs to be the primary driver. The sales organization needs to consistently seek out new business. The second is client retention. We conduct monthly Net Promoter Score (NPS) and Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) surveys, which we have been doing for more than nine years. These surveys provide us with invaluable employee and client feedback, helping us to continuously address any concerns and improve our workplace environment. It’s not always what you want to hear, but the feedback is vital for success. The third is M&A, but it is designed to complement the other two, not replace them.

 How have you integrated employees from acquired companies into your business?

 We have taken a different approach than most acquirers in the industry. Our goal is to always hold onto the seller’s employees, especially if they are client facing. This helps from a client retention perspective and helps employees who may have uncertainty about the company being acquired. G&A has nearly 800 employees. In fact, over the past five years, one in four employees has joined the company through an acquisition. We aim to be a destination workplace, ensuring our employees are motivated and aligned with our business goals and key performance indicators.

 Tell us about your most recent acquisition of GrowthForce.

 GrowthForce will merge with G&A Partners’ outsourced accounting division to form an innovative financial operations platform focused on transforming the client experience. The newly combined team will operate under the GrowthForce brand as a G&A Partners company. As a CPA at heart, I know the power of accurate, actionable financial data. Welcoming GrowthForce into our family is an exciting milestone. The company’s deep accounting expertise aligns perfectly with our mission to help businesses thrive through smarter insights.

 Also, you also expanded your HCM reach with the acquisition of AmCheck Austin and AmCheck Las Vegas. Tell us about that expansion.

 AmCheck Austin and AmCheck Las Vegas are two independently operated payroll franchises. These acquisitions reinforce our commitment to delivering scalable, robust HCM technology to growing businesses nationwide. Many small to mid-sized businesses are still burdened by manual HR processes, which hinder their growth and productivity. Our HCM capabilities provide them with the streamlined workflows and compliance management they need to thrive. We are excited to offer these powerful tools to an even wider client base.

 As the industry continues to evolve, what’s next for G&A Partners?

 The industry will continue to evolve, and G&A will adapt and pivot to be successful. Our focus from the beginning has been on enhancing the customer experience and making decisions that prioritize their best interests. As we look ahead to the next decade, our goal is to continue to grow organically, pursue strategic acquisitions, and retain our valued clients by delivering innovative solutions that anticipate their evolving needs.
