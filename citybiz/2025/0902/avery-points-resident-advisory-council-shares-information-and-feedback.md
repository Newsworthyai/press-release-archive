# Avery Point’s Resident Advisory Council Shares Information and Feedback

By Michele Wojciechowski

 On the first Friday of every month at Avery Point, an Erickson Senior Living community in Short Pump, Va., eight resident volunteers–better known as the Resident Advisory Council–get together.

 Their mission is important, as they act as a voice for their peers and foster a strong relationship between residents and the community’s leaders. They spend time talking about the ideas and feedback that have come from neighbors and the seven committees that report to the group.

 “The Resident Advisory Council listens and acts as a conduit of communication between the residents and management,” says Diane Prevary, Resident Advisory Council (RAC) secretary and liaison to the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging Committee. “The RAC makes suggestions to campus administration, based on what we hear from residents.”

 Building the council In late 2023, about a year after Avery Point opened, work begun behind the scenes to get the RAC up and running.

 “The election committee was formed with nine people,” says Charlie Anderson, RAC member and liaison to the Health and Well-Being Committee. “We had three subcommittees: A recruiting committee; a promotion committee, which organized the forum where each candidate running for a position would give a five-minute speech about why they wanted to be on the RAC; and a committee of residents who counted the votes.”

 Initially, five RAC positions were open, and 12 people ran.

 “I think that shows the dynamic nature of Avery Point residents,” notes Carroll Bruner, RAC chair. “In fact, we were only going to start with three RAC members. But after the administration saw the interest, they added two more.”

 During that first election, Carroll and Diane were elected, as were residents Tom Dunck, RAC vice chair and liaison to the Finance Committee; Elam Jarrells, RAC member and liaison to the Resident Life Committee; and Madonna Byrkeland, RAC member and liaison to the General Services Committee.

 “The one commitment the five original members made was that our only job was to get the RAC up and going–we would not run for reelection,” says Carroll. “There was enough interest from the community to step aside when our terms end and let others have a chance to lead.”

 Advocating for all In 2024, after the original members were sworn in, the first order of business was establishing the seven committees: Dining; Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging; Finance; Philanthropy; General Services; Resident Life; and Health and Well-Being.

 “Because there were only five of us, we were able to pair a couple of somewhat related committees under one RAC member,” recalls Diane. “For one year, Resident Life and Health and Well-Being were grouped together and Finance and Philanthropy were as well.”

 She adds, “We anticipated that more people would be elected at the end of 2024, and at that time, we’d be able to split up those combined committees. We succeeded in doing that this year!”

 Now, the RAC has eight members, including Charlie; Al Hockaday, RAC member and liaison to the Philanthropy Committee; and Judy Lissner, RAC member and liaison to the Dining Committee.

 Next year, another member will be added to ensure that each residence building on campus has a representative on the RAC.

 Working together In addition to their first Friday gathering, each member meets with the committee they oversee on a monthly basis.

 The RAC also meets with Avery Point administration on the third Friday of every month.

 “All the committees submit their monthly minutes or summary notes to me electronically. Then, I send them out to management and all the RAC members, so that we have read all the information before our meeting,” says Diane.

 “From a management perspective, they feel comfortable testing ideas and thoughts on us before presenting them to the community in Town Halls,” says Carroll. “Our job is to listen to both sides and provide feedback to both sides. But we also make recommendations.”

 She continues, “Last year, the RAC asked for several things for the community based on resident suggestions. As a result, we’re getting a second bus to be used for campus transportation!”

 Compassionate leaders Thanks to their dedicated, compassionate leadership, the RAC has created a supportive environment that encourages residents to speak their mind.

 “The RAC provides residents with a group of fellow residents that they can go and talk with and feel comfortable with,” notes Carroll.

 “At the end of the day,” adds Charlie, “the RAC is here to help residents and management, and it’s just a great feeling to be part of that!”
