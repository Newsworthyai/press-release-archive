# A16z Speedrun Opens Applications for SR006, Offering up to $1 Million for New Startups Globally

a16z speedrun has opened applications for SR006, the latest edition of its highly successful startup program. The 12-week program will kick off late January 2026 in San Francisco as it continues its mission to support ambitious founders at the earliest stages of building the technology and innovation of tomorrow, culminating in a Demo Day in April 2026. Each accepted company will receive an investment up to $1 million, along with hands-on mentorship, strategic guidance, and access to an elite global network to help startups scale faster.

 “We are energized by the success of so many a16z speedrun alumni as they redefine what is possible,” said Josh Lu, Principal at a16z. “Each new cohort continues to inspire us with bold ideas and fresh approaches that defy simple categorization. As the accelerator continues to expand and evolve, so does the potential for transformative innovation.”

 SR005 marked a major milestone, becoming the accelerator’s largest and most diverse cohort to date:

 * 60+ companies were selected from more than 14,000 applications, with an acceptance rate of less than 0.5%.
* Founders represented a growing global footprint, with founders from Canada, Spain, France, Turkey, the UK, Israel, and many more.

 Since launching in 2023, a16z speedrun has rapidly scaled, deploying more than $180 million to fund over 150 startups. Throughout the program, founders gain access to the a16z speedrun’s unparalleled network of peers and alumni. Founders accepted to the program also participate in workshops and coaching sessions led by visionaries across tech, venture and entertainment.

 SR006 will run for 12 weeks in San Francisco beginning on January 26, 2026, concluding with a Demo Day in April 2026.
