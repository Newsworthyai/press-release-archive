# DPR Construction Completes Topping Out of Memorial Emergency Department in Miramar

The South Florida Business Unit of DPR Construction, one of the nation’s top technical builders, has topped out the first phase of construction of Memorial Healthcare System’s new 16,800-square-foot free standing emergency department (FSED), located at Miramar Parkway and Red Road in Miramar, Florida.

 Designed to serve Broward County’s fast-growing community, the facility will include 13 examination rooms, eight fast track rooms, a pediatric treatment area, a trauma/resuscitation room, advanced imaging (CT and x-ray) and on-site lab capabilities. The facility is scheduled to be fully operational by the second quarter of 2026.

 “With the population projected to increase by 10% by 2029, this new FSED will offer convenient access to care and will help reduce wait times,” said Memorial Hospital Pembroke CEO Felicia Turnley. The FSED is one of Memorial’s facilities and Turnley added that this area of Miramar comprises a total of 27% of Memorial’s emergency room volume.

 DPR Construction’s Senior Project Manager Luke Stocking, added that the building’s topping out will be completed by the end of August and that remaining on schedule has been possible with support from local leaders.

 “Working with the City of Miramar as well as other local authorities has been a pleasure,” he said. “Because this site had never been developed before, we’ve had to work with more entities. However, all have been extremely responsive, enabling our team to meet expectations and manage an effective construction process.”

 DPR is constructing another FSED for Memorial in Pembroke Pines, on Douglas Road, that also is planned to open in 2026. For both projects, DPR was able to tackle ongoing labor challenges and create greater efficiencies by handling of some scopes with their inhouse self-perform team.

 Celebrating its 20th anniversary in South Florida, DPR and its more than 100 local employees handle approximately $260 million in construction projects per year throughout Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties.
