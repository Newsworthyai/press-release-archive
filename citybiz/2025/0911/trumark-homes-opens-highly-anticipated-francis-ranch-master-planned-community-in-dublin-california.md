* Picturesque locale in eastern hills of Dublin features a variety of single-family and townhome options for homebuyers

 Trumark Homes, the award-winning Western U.S. homebuilder, has opened its long-anticipated master-planned community of Francis Ranch in Dublin. With 573 homes across six distinct neighborhoods, and a range of floorplans and options for every stage of life, Francis Ranch was designed to integrate the region’s heritage with modern Bay Area living.

 A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held with local officials from the city, Dublin Chamber of Commerce and community partners to celebrate the milestone.

 “Creating the master-planned community of Francis Ranch and honoring the land’s rich ranching history has been a very inspiring and rewarding journey for our team,” said Trumark Homes’ Northern California Division President, Tony Bosowski. “This thoughtfully designed community is truly shaped by its surroundings, blending high quality homes and modern features with the natural surroundings and scenic hillsides, to create an idyllic, one-of-a-kind environment for families and individuals to thrive.”

 Trumark Homes will build four of the six neighborhoods in Francis Ranch. This includes:

 * Marigold includes 98 single-family detached motor court homes with three floorplans ranging from 2,470 square feet to 2,629 square feet, four bedrooms, three bathrooms and a two-car garage. Prices start in the upper $1 millions.*

 * Azure features 98 single-family homes with four floorplans ranging from 3,650 square feet to 3,941 square feet, four bedrooms, five-and-a-half bathrooms and a two-car garage. Prices start in the mid $2 millions.*

 * Orchid includes 101 single-family homes with four floorplans ranging from 4,398 square feet to 4,845 square feet, four to five bedrooms, five full and two half bathrooms, and a three-car garage. Prices start in the high $2 millions.*

 * Jasmine features 100 two- and three-story townhomes ranging from 1,921 square feet to 2,072 square feet, three to four bedrooms, two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half bathrooms and a two-car garage. Prices will be announced when sales begin in late 2025.

 The community will also contain two spacious neighborhood parks, Northern Park and Southern Park, as well as a nearby trail network for hiking and exploration.

 Located in East Dublin near the Dublin/Pleasanton BART Station and Interstate 580, Francis Ranch offers unparalleled access to Silicon Valley, San Francisco and the greater East Bay for business and recreation. Popular shopping, dining and entertainment destinations in and around Dublin include the Stoneridge Shopping Center, Hacienda Crossings, San Francisco Premium Outlets and Bankhead Theater. Several wineries also call the Tri-Valley home, with community events and concerts throughout the year.

 Francis Ranch residents will benefit from entry to the highly rated Dublin Unified School District, including nearby Cottonwood Creek Elementary and the planned new Emerald High School, while outdoor and sports enthusiasts will appreciate proximity to Iron Horse Trail, Emerald Glen Park and Fallon Sports Park.

 In addition to Francis Ranch, Trumark Homes’ Northern California Division is actively selling several new home communities including Arroyo Crossings in Livermore; Skyline in Alameda; Apricot Estates in Brentwood; Ascend in San Jose; and Dawn, Vida, and Origin at the Collective 55+ community in Manteca, with additional new home communities set to be announced soon.

 “Francis Ranch is the result of an incredible combination of teamwork, innovation, environmental stewardship, and commitment, and our team could not be prouder of how this community has come together” added Bosowski. “Welcoming homebuyers to Francis Ranch is something our team has anticipated with excitement for years, and we know it will be embraced by all who call it home.”

 Model homes for the neighborhoods of Azure and Orchid are now available to tour, with the Welcome Center open seven days a week from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. and located at 1800 Humphreys Way in Dublin.
