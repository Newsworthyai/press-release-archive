# Q&amp;A with Peter Horadan, CEO of Vouched

Peter Horadan is the CEO of Vouched, the leader in AI-powered identity verification for healthcare, banking, and financial services. He joined Vouched with a track record in fundraising and driving growth and innovation in SaaS, having created over $20 billion in market cap as Chief Executive or Technology Leader in his prior roles.

 Prior to Vouched, Peter founded Seattle-based Lockstep in 2019, which he scaled and then sold to The Sage Group in 2022. Peter founded Lockstep to create the world’s first connected accounting platform. Upon growing the company’s digital network to connect more than 26,000 companies, Horadan successfully sold the company to The Sage Group, the leader in accounting, financial, HR, and payroll technology for SMBs.

 Our goal is to be the identity verification layer that powers trust in every transaction, human or digital.

 Prior to that, Horadan built the technology at transactional tax titan Avalara during the critical growth phase leading to the company’s IPO. His career has also included leadership roles at Concur Technologies, Scout Analytics, Microsoft, Corillian, and BEA Systems.

 Could you share highlights from your career—spanning roles at Microsoft, Concur, Avalara, and founding Lockstep—and what ultimately led you to assume leadership at Vouched?

 I’ve been fortunate to be at the front of waves of technological change that has reshaped industry. At Microsoft, Concur, and Avalara, I helped drive the automation of the banking, expense management, and sales tax industries from entirely manual processes to automated ones.. Later, I co-founded Lockstep, where we reimagined accounting automation. That entrepreneurial experience gave me a deep appreciation for building solutions that solve mission-critical problems.

 When I was introduced to Vouched, I immediately saw the same pattern: a huge, industry-wide challenge—identity verification—where the right technology could completely change the way businesses operate. The chance to lead Vouched was an opportunity to take everything I’ve learned and apply it to one of the most important trust and safety issues of our time.

 What specific market problem does Vouched address?

 Identity verification is no longer just about checking a driver’s license—it’s about stopping fraud, ensuring compliance, and making onboarding seamless for both people and, increasingly, AI agents. In healthcare, that means safeguarding patient data and enabling care without barriers. In financial services, it’s giving institutions the confidence to serve customers digitally at scale, without compromising security.

 The challenge is clear: legacy solutions are too slow, rigid, and easy to bypass. Vouched solves this with real-time, AI-driven, user-friendly verification and by pioneering Know Your Agent (KYA)—ensuring businesses can trust not only who they’re interacting with, but also what they’re interacting with in the digital economy.

 Could you elaborate on Vouched’s technology and what sets it apart from other solutions in the market?

 Vouched uses advanced AI and computer vision to verify identities in seconds. What sets us apart is flexibility—we adapt to each customer’s needs, from healthcare providers onboarding patients remotely to financial institutions meeting strict compliance standards, to businesses preparing for AI-driven interactions.

 Our technology goes beyond document checks to confirm the individual—and increasingly, the digital agent—behind them. This is the essence of Know Your Agent (KYA), a new standard for building trust when not all participants in a transaction are human. That extra assurance is why some of the most demanding industries rely on us.

 Speed, accuracy, adaptability, and KYA innovation define Vouched. And unlike “black box” solutions, we give customers control and visibility into the process. That transparency builds confidence for both businesses and their end users.

 What major trends are reshaping the ID Verification industry right now, and where do you see the biggest opportunities for innovation?

 The industry is evolving quickly. Digital IDs are gaining traction worldwide, mobile driver’s licenses are becoming more common, and passports now include NFC chips for instant reading.

 The biggest frontier is Know Your Agent (KYA)—the ability to verify not only people but also AI agents acting on their behalf. As digital interactions expand, transactions will increasingly involve bots booking appointments, handling financial tasks, or making purchases. Businesses need confidence in both who and what they’re engaging with. Combining KYA with digital and mobile ID verification ensures trust across every interaction.

 With your recent $17M Series A round, how are you prioritizing the allocation of resources? Which areas are receiving the most attention?

 We’ve been deliberate about how we invest. A major focus is advancing our technology—staying ahead of fraud, creating the most seamless user experience, and leading in Know Your Agent (KYA). As AI agents play a larger role in digital transactions, verifying not just identities but also digital entities is becoming essential.

 We’re also expanding in industries where identity verification is mission-critical—healthcare, financial services, automotive, and eCommerce. And we’re growing our team, because identity verification is a trust business, and trust depends on the right people scaling responsibly while supporting customers at the highest level.

 Looking ahead, what are Vouched’s biggest priorities for the next few years, and what advice would you give to business leaders trying to scale their company?

 Our priorities are clear: accelerate innovation, grow in regulated industries, and strengthen partnerships that make Vouched indispensable. A core part of that innovation is advancing Know Your Agent (KYA)—extending verification beyond people to the AI agents that are becoming central to digital interactions. Our goal is to be the identity verification layer that powers trust in every transaction, human or digital.

 For leaders scaling their companies, my advice is simple: stay focused on solving real problems for your customers. Technology will evolve and markets will shift, but if you address critical needs with clarity and conviction, you’ll create lasting impact.
