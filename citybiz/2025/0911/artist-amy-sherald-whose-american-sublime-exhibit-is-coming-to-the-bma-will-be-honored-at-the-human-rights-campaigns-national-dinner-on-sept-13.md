# Artist Amy Sherald, Whose “American Sublime” Exhibit Is Coming To The BMA, Will Be Honored At The Human Rights Campaign’s National Dinner On Sept. 13

Renowned artist and former Baltimore resident Amy Sherald will receive the Human Rights Campaign’s “Ally for Equality Award” at its sold-out National Dinner in Washington on Saturday.

 The HRC, the nation’s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) civil rights organization, announced that Sherald is being honored “for amplifying the existence and experiences of the LGBTQ+ people in her art, best exemplified by her work “Trans Forming Liberty” which reimagines Black transgender artist Arewà Basit as the Statue of Liberty.”

 That 2024 painting, ”alongside her outspoken advocacy, serves as a bold demand for visibility and a call for inclusion in the American dream — especially at a time of enhanced political and social antagonism,” the HRC stated.

 The dinner at the Washington Hilton will bring together more than 2,000 members, leaders and advocates to raise funds and support LGBTQ+ equality across the country.
