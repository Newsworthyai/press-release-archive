# Siena Lakes Opens Continuing Care Neighborhood

The premier continuing care retirement community in Naples expands healthcare options

 Siena Lakes, an Erickson Senior Living community in Naples, Fla., is now offering on-site assisted living at Torre Square, the new continuing care neighborhood at Siena Lakes, as part of the comprehensive healthcare services it offers to residents.

 “At Torre Square, residents thrive as part of a vibrant community, with state-of-the-art amenities and peace of mind that high-quality, personalized care is available as their health needs evolve,” said Michael McCormick, Executive Director. “This new neighborhood helps us meet the growing demand for exceptional care for seniors.”

 The new two-story building features ample amenity spaces and interior courtyards to support residents’ vibrant lifestyle. In the future, the second floor will provide memory care and long-term nursing, strengthening our ability to meet residents’ needs across the full continuum of care.

 Torre Square is named after a beautiful tower in the town square of Siena, Italy, known as the Piazza del Campo. The Italian word for tower is Torre (pronounced Tore-Ray).

 In addition to its continuing care neighborhood, Siena Lakes is home to a vibrant independent living neighborhood on 29 acres, where more than 495 residents enjoy an active, engaged retirement lifestyle.

 The growth of Siena Lakes continues to create new career opportunities. To search for available positions and to apply on-line, please visit www.ericksonseniorliving.com/careers.
