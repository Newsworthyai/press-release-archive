# Code Ninjas Debuts in Greensboro, Bringing Video Game–Based Learning to Kids

Code Ninjas, the nation’s largest and fastest-growing kids coding franchise, is opening its newest location in Greensboro on September 20. Located at 2961 Battleground Ave, the center will help children ages 5–14 learn computer coding, robotics, and other STEM skills through interactive video game projects, providing a fun and safe space to explore technology and problem-solving.

 To celebrate the grand opening, Code Ninjas of Greensboro will host a community event on Saturday, September 20 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Families can enjoy free workshops, games, giveaways, prizes, and sweet treats from a local ice cream truck. The Greensboro Chamber of Commerce will be on-site to welcome the new business, and Miracle Dojos will make a $2,000 donation to Duke Children’s Hospital through its partnership with Extra Life during the festivities. Families who register during the event will receive a Founders Promotion, including a waived $50 registration fee and 10% off membership.

 Meet the Local Owners:

 The Greensboro Code Ninjas is proudly owned by Miles and Ashley Martin, a husband-and-wife team with deep roots in the Triad. Miles has more than 20 years of experience in IT and cybersecurity, and together they share a passion for giving children opportunities to explore technology and coding. The Martins are parents to three children, and their own family inspired them to bring Code Ninjas to Greensboro, creating a space where kids can learn coding, robotics, and problem-solving while having fun. They also own the Code Ninjas location in High Point and plan to expand further into Winston-Salem.

 “AI and other technologies are transforming the way we live and work, and it’s so important to help kids in our community prepare for these changes,” said Miles Martin. “Code Ninjas offers a fun, welcoming space where children develop skills like coding, critical thinking, and teamwork. Through hands-on STEM projects and game creation, kids build the confidence and creativity they’ll need to thrive in the future workforce.”

 Empowering the Next Generation of Coders

 Designed to make STEM education both accessible and enjoyable, Code Ninjas helps children ages 5-14 build practical skills in coding, problem-solving, and critical thinking. The structured curriculum is modeled after martial arts, guiding students through nine belt levels—from white to black. While the program is self-paced, kids are supported by trained instructors, called Code Senseis, and benefit from collaboration with peers.

 Small milestones and “Belt-Up” celebrations keep students motivated along the way. By the end of the program, each child will have created and published their own app, gaining real-world experience and confidence with technology in a fun, supportive setting.

 Code Ninjas Greensboro offers flexible weeknight drop-in sessions, weekend camps, and Parents Night Out events. Learn more at https://www.codeninjas.com/nc-greensboro or call 336-645-6550.
