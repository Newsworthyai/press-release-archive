 (1) The mass balance traceability chain is a method used to track the flow of materials through a production system. and attribute the inputs of a production process, to outputs of that production process through certified bookkeeping. This distinct accounting method verifies that the certified feedstock has replaced an equivalent quantity of fossil raw materials at the beginning of the supply chain and can be attributed to the product-to-be-sold, ensuring that both input and output are balanced.

(2) Refers to the durability of the finished coating after application.

 (3) A bio-attributed content indicates that the use of a biobased or recycled feedstock has been ascribed using a mass-balance methodology. The bio-attributed content is the % breakdown based on the ISCC+ methodology calculation.
