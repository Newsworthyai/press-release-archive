# Venture Atlanta Announces 2025 Lineup of Breakthrough Tech Companies

Venture Atlanta, one of the nation’s largest and most prestigious venture capital conferences, today announced the standout tech companies selected to present at its 18th annual event taking place October 15-16 at The Woodruff Arts Center and Atlanta Symphony Hall. To view the list of this year’s hottest tech companies, go here.

 Building on its long-standing reputation as the premier venture conference in the Southeast, this year’s event will feature 86 companies and is expected to draw more than 1,600 attendees, including 450 investors from across the country—underscoring its position as a must-attend gathering for the region’s tech innovation economy. Venture Atlanta 2025 will feature expanded programming and enhanced networking opportunities designed to deliver even greater value to startups, growth-stage companies, investors, and ecosystem builders.

 “We’re always raising the bar—this year more than ever,” said Allyson Eman, CEO of Venture Atlanta. “Not only is the quality of companies the best we’ve ever seen, our new Procurement Palooza will feature a panel and breakout session with 15 procurement leaders from some of the region’s largest enterprises. This offers attendees unprecedented access to decision-makers and real pathways to supplier opportunities. We’ve also expanded our executive sessions, added curated networking, and refined the showcase experience. We’re laser-focused on maximizing impact and creating moments that matter for our attendees. If you’re part of the Southeast tech scene, Venture Atlanta is the one event you can’t afford to miss.”

 This year’s event will feature the broadest regional representation in the event’s history, with standout companies from every corner of the Southeast—including Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. Nowhere else can investors connect with the very best companies from across all 14 markets in one place. Rather than traveling to separate events across multiple states and months, attendees can meet them all in just two action-packed days. Alumni success stories like Flock Safety’s $275M raise, VIVA Finance’s $220M, and multiple acquisitions prove the Venture Atlanta network drives real results—and this year’s lineup is ready to deliver the next big wins.

 Since its founding, Venture Atlanta has helped launch more than 930 companies, facilitating over $8 billion in capital raised and $20.8 billion in successful exits. What began as a regional showcase has grown into one of the nation’s most impactful venture communities and serves as a powerful platform for the Southeast’s most promising tech startups. Notable alumni include Bark, CallRail, Car360, Flock Safety, Florence Healthcare, ParkMobile, Salesloft, Kabbage, Bitcoin Depot, PrizePicks, Stax, SingleOps, Pindrop, Terminus, and many others.

 Whether you’re raising capital, seeking enterprise partnerships, hiring top talent, or simply gaining visibility, Venture Atlanta 2025 provides a uniquely powerful platform.

 Pitch Event with $375K Investment Prize Continues for Third Year

 Back again by popular demand, Venture Atlanta will host pitch competitions for early-stage and growth-stage companies—as well as the “Startup Showcase Live” competition for pre-seed and seed-stage companies, with the winner of the latter receiving a $375,000 investment prize.

 The $375,000 prize is funded by newcomer Cofounders Capital, and returning funds Front Porch Venture Partners, Knoll Ventures, and TiE Atlanta Angels. The first round of pitches will be voted on by the Venture Atlanta audience, who will determine the companies that move on to be judged by an all-star panel of investors.

 “Venture Atlanta has unquestionably become the Southeast’s can’t-miss tech conference, continually evolving by taking risks, trying new things, and finding fresh ways to serve our ecosystem,” said Emery Waddell, General Partner, Vocap Partners and Venture Atlanta Board Member. “This year is no different as we showcase the very best companies from across the region, backed by a refreshed agenda and hyper-relevant networking opportunities.”

 Venture Atlanta continues to deepen its partnerships with leading accelerators, incubators, venture capital conferences and entrepreneur hubs—including the Florida Venture Capital Conference, Capital Factory, gener8tor, Nashville Entrepreneur Center, South Carolina Research Authority, Tampa Bay Wave, RevTech Labs, Idea Village, and Innovate Mississippi—many of which will be supporting and attending this year’s event. In addition, the organization expanded its presence across the Southeast and beyond, with leadership engaging at major events such as SlossTech in Birmingham, 3rd Coast Venture Summit, SXSW, Seed the South, and Capital Capital in Washington, D.C.

 Garrett Langley, Founder & CEO of Flock Safety, will be this year’s keynote speaker. A Venture Atlanta alum who pitched in 2020, Langley returns to the stage on Wednesday, October 15, to share insights from his journey building Flock into a $7.5 billion safety tech powerhouse. Known for his bold mission to eliminate crime and a career spanning multiple high-impact startups, Langley’s keynote promises to inspire founders, investors, and innovators alike.

 “It’s hard to overstate the impact Venture Atlanta has—not just on the city, but on the entire Southeastern startup ecosystem,” said Kelly Anne O’Neill, SVP of Revenue and Strategy, Dualboot Partners and chairman of the Venture Atlanta Recruiting and Screening Committee. “It’s more than a conference; it’s a community, a platform, an investment engine, and a business accelerator. What makes it special is the way founders, funders, and service partners rally around it. Venture Atlanta is the catalyst transforming the Southeast into a launchpad for companies that change industries. You won’t find anything like it anywhere else.”
