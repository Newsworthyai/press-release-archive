# Q&amp;A with Daniel Powell, President &amp; CEO at Spark Biomedical

Daniel Powell has over 25 years of experience delivering technical solutions across multiple industries. In 2006, Mr. Powell found his true passion in medical devices, specifically neurostimulation, and has since launched multiple products in the space, including Deep Brain Stimulation for movement disorders and Vagus Nerve Stimulation for Epilepsy.

 Our mission at Spark and OhmBody is to advance wearable neurostimulation to treat as many of these conditions as possible. Beyond menstrual wellness, we have our sights set on endometriosis, PCOS, and menopause. We believe we can make a profound impact on women’s lives in these areas.

 Mr. Powell co-founded and serves as CEO of Spark Biomedical, the developer of the FDA-cleared Sparrow Ascent; a novel, wearable neurostimulation solution to address opioid withdrawal and addiction for adults. Under Mr. Powell’s leadership, Spark continues to advance the science of wearable neurostimulation and is developing a solution for Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome – addressing the most vulnerable victims of the opioid epidemic, newborn babies.

 You have a long history in the medical device industry. Can you tell us about what led you to found Spark?

 I fell in love with the medical device industry back in 2006, specifically with the idea of using electricity to treat disease. This field, known as neuromodulation, fascinated me. For over 15 years, I worked on invasive approaches like Deep Brain Stimulation for movement disorders and vagus nerve stimulation for epilepsy. But it was only after meeting my co-founders, Dr. Alejandro Covalin and Dr. Navid Khosaparast, that I discovered the incredible potential of non-invasive brain stimulation. At Spark, we’re pioneering an approach that combines both trigeminal and vagus nerve stimulation to address imbalances in the brain.

 Spark recently received funding from Wellcome Leap to advance women’s health innovation. What does this milestone mean for you and for the company?

 It’s a tremendous honor to be recognized by such a historic and prestigious organization. This funding is a game-changer; it will allow Spark to conduct an FDA-style clinical study, which is the final step to obtaining FDA clearance and CE mark so we can bring OhmBody to the world. We’re also incredibly proud to be the only non-research institution among the awardees—it’s a testament to the clinical validity of the work our team is doing.

 OhmBody, Spark’s women’s wellness division, is part of that work. What inspired the creation of OhmBody, and how does it fit into Spark’s larger mission?

 The idea for OhmBody was born from a pivotal moment in our research. In 2023, we licensed research and patents to use neurostimulation to improve hemostasis, which is essentially using the nervous system to help blood clot faster and stronger. One of our first clinical trials applied this to women with heavy menstrual bleeding.

 The results were better than we ever expected, with a 55% reduction in blood loss and a 20% shorter cycle time. What was truly remarkable, though, were the other benefits our participants reported: a significant reduction in cramping and improved energy and mood. We realized we weren’t just creating a blood loss reduction product, but a complete solution for menstruation.

 Innovation in neurostimulation and wearable medical technology is accelerating. Where do you see the biggest opportunities for Spark in the next 3–5 years?

 Our vision is to grow the OhmBody offering to address other conditions that impact women’s lives, such as endometriosis, PCOS, and menopause. We will also continue to develop hemostasis solutions for non-compressible hemorrhages, like GI bleeds, as well as for surgical and traumatic blood loss.

 What have been some of the greatest challenges of leading a medtech company at the intersection of neuroscience, technology, and patient care, and how have you navigated them?

 In the world of neuroscience, the biggest challenge is always changing behaviors. People are used to reaching for a pill first, regardless of the side effects or how well it works. Raising awareness with both clinicians and individuals is key to changing that mindset. We also face the industry-wide challenge of access and reimbursement. While we continue to work on those efforts, we are also committed to making our product as accessible as possible to everyone who needs it.

 How do you approach building partnerships, whether with researchers, healthcare providers, or funders like Wellcome Leap, to scale Spark’s impact?

 We’ve been very successful at building partnerships because we lead with science. It’s one of our founding values: to do the science and do it right. I genuinely believe our clinical team is the best I have ever worked with, and their dedication to scientific rigor is what makes our partnerships so strong.

 From your perspective, what are the unmet needs in women’s health that companies like Spark and OhmBody can uniquely address?

 The real question is, “Where isn’t there an unmet need?” Women’s health has been severely neglected for too long, and it’s only in the last few years that this gap in care and research has been widely acknowledged. Our mission at Spark and OhmBody is to advance wearable neurostimulation to treat as many of these conditions as possible. Beyond menstrual wellness, we have our sights set on endometriosis, PCOS, and menopause. We believe we can make a profound impact on women’s lives in these areas.

 You’ve been both an innovator and a leader. What lessons have you learned as a CEO that you would share with other entrepreneurs in healthcare technology?

 Healthcare is tricky. You’d think if you have a solution that alleviates pain or improves lives, success would be guaranteed. It’s not. The complex ecosystem of regulatory bodies like the FDA and reimbursement systems like CMS can define your solution and how it’s accessed. On top of that, the medical community is overworked and understaffed, which can make them resistant to change. If your solution adds cost or time to the current standard of care, you’ll have to find a way to offset that or face significant barriers to adoption. You have to be realistic about these challenges and plan for them from the start.
