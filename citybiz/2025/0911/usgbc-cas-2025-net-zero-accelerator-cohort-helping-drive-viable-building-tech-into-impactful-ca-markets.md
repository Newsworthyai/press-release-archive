# USGBC-CA’s 2025 Net Zero Accelerator Cohort Helping Drive Viable Building Tech into Impactful CA Markets

* Register to attend the annual NZA Community Meet & Greet September 12, 2025, featuring rapid-fire presentations and one-on-one advisor matchmaking.

 USGBC California (USGBC-CA) is proud to announce the 2025 cohort of the Net Zero Accelerator® (NZA), the world’s first accelerator exclusively focused on net zero innovation for the built environment. This year’s program showcases a curated group of companies ready to deploy practical, cost-effective solutions in partnership with industry leaders across California and beyond.

 The 2025 cohort delivers across core pillars of high-performance building technology, including energy, water, materials, HVAC, platforms, and waste, offering actionable systems designed for real-world use and scalable impact. These companies represent a wide geographic range, from California and Texas to Canada, the UK, and Singapore, reinforcing California’s role as a commercial testbed for durable, future-ready real estate and infrastructure solutions.

 Since its inception, the Net Zero Accelerator has helped more than 100 growth-stage companies secure over 60 pilot deployments, advancing commercial readiness and long-term economic performance across the state.

 “These founders are building things the world really needs,” said Colin Mangham, Director of Innovation at USGBC California. “And they’re doing it with urgency, clarity, and a strong business case. They’re bringing disciplined focus and economic logic to the implementation of common-sense solutions that are in high demand. Our role is to help clear the path so these innovations can deliver meaningful, measurable results.”

 2025 cohort members by focus area:

 * Advanced Materials: HempCement Co. (Los Angeles, CA), Mad River Mass Timber (Korbel, CA)
* Building Envelope: ThermalShell (Frisco, TX)
* Building Systems: Gradient (San Francisco, CA), Verdant Structural (Berkeley, CA)
* Energy Resources & Efficiency: AlumaPower (Ontario, CN), Ampd Energy (Singapore), Verv Energy (Los Angeles, CA), Wayside Energy (Los Angeles, CA)
* HVAC & Air Quality: Build Smartr Robotics (British Columbia, CN), Harvest Thermal (Kensington, CA)
* Waste Reduction & Circularity: Atrium Energy (San Diego, CA) Further JanSan (Los Angeles, CA), Digne (Los Angeles, CA)
* Water Conservation: Capture H2O (Solana Beach, CA), Performance Resource Management (San Diego, CA)

 The NZA’s six-month program is designed to help pilot-ready, commercially available building technologies overcome the biggest barriers to market adoption. Open to companies from around the world, the program offers a high-impact blend of strategic support and practical opportunity. Cohort participants engage in targeted workshops, connect with investors, advisors, and pilot hosts, and receive tailored guidance focused on achieving product-market fit in California’s diverse regions and cities.

 “This is a mature group of companies that are ready to scale today,” said Ben Stapleton, Executive Director of USGBC California. “These companies are delivering on new building materials, energy storage, electrification, and climate resilience to help California lead in pushing the future of buildings to create healthier and more affordable communities, not just here, but globally. We’re proud to have California taking the lead when the federal government is backing off.”

 Participants also gain access to a trusted network of industry professionals, municipal partners, and technical experts through the USGBC California community, all working toward the shared goal of advancing solutions that improve building performance, lower risk, reduce waste, and deliver long-term value. The program is led by Mangham and Stapleton. Together, they have supported hundreds of startups in securing hundreds of millions in venture funding and scaling adoption and impact.

 Pilot deployments are at the heart of the NZA experience. Past participants have completed high-profile pilots in affordable housing, higher education, and public-sector demonstration projects. The latest Pilot Flight Manual features program highlights and pilot opportunities from the recently graduated 2024 cohort companies.

 The annual NZA Community Meet & Greet, this time featuring Pilot Flight Plans, returns September 12, 2025, open to all, featuring rapid-fire presentations and one-on-one advisor matchmaking. The 2025 edition of the Pilot Flight Manual will also be released at the event.

 “If we really look down the road for impact,” Mangham adds, “net zero isn’t the finish line. In finance, net zero is just breakeven. What we’re really after are net positive solutions, technologies and strategies that create more than they consume. That’s where real value emerges, and when done right, that leads to net profit too. It’s just smart business.”

 Returning and new partners include leaders from real estate, architecture, engineering, public utilities, finance, and academia. These include (alphabetically): The 50L Home Coalition, Buro Happold, Business Finland, Consulate General of Canada, CIM Group, CSUDH, Environmental Defense Fund, Frederick Fisher and Partners, Gensler, GreenNRG Institute, Hathaway Dinwiddie, HDR, IQHQ, Kilroy Realty, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, Lennar, Metro, Momentum, NRDC, NREL, Rexford Industrial, Rising Realty, Skanska, Southern California Edison, Southern California Gas Company, Urban Land Institute, UCLA, USC, Verdical Group, and more onboarding now for 2025.
