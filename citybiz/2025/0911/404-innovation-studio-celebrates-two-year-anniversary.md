# 404 Innovation Studio Celebrates Two-Year Anniversary

404 Innovation Studio is celebrating its second anniversary, continuing its mission to challenge the traditional agency model and create narratives, products, and experiences that people wish existed.

 Founded in 2023, 404 is a design-first innovation studio. Its founders believe that change in the advertising and media industry is not optional – it is a design problem. Rather than operating with rigid departments, 404 is structured with just two teams united by a single mission: Operations, which manages client relationships and the work experience, and Product, which integrates creative and technical disciplines from copywriting and design to coding, CX, and content creation.

 In just two years, 404 has already been recognized as the second most creative independent Brazilian company at Cannes Lions 2024, named the most creative Brazilian company overall by Clio Entertainment, and launched NOS, an operating system built in partnership with Natura and Galeria.Ag to accelerate change at one of the world’s most admired brands.

 “The ‘404: page not found’ error, which usually signals a dead end, has become our philosophy,” said Rafael Caldeira, co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of 404. “For us, it is a starting point for experimentation, collaboration, and innovation.”

 Caldeira continues, “The studio’s name draws inspiration from Error 404, “Page Not Found”—one of the world’s most famous errors—serving as a catalyst for experimentation. We believe that innovation inevitably brings unpredictable challenges, and to turn these innovations into competitive advantages, errors must be embraced as part of the process. The primary role of creative leadership today is creating an environment that fosters experimentation, where people feel safe to take risks and develop new ideas.”
