# Area Agency on Aging of Broward County Hosts Inaugural Empowering Caregivers Disaster Preparedness Conference

The Area Agency on Aging of Broward County (AAABC) and the Broward County Dementia Care & Cure Initiative Task Force, held its inaugural Empowering Caregivers Disaster Preparedness Conference on June 30 at the Flamingo Park Meeting Hall in Sunrise, Florida. The half-day conference focused on helping older adults and caregivers prepare for hurricanes, power outages, and other emergencies. Free registration and lunch were provided to Broward older adults and caregivers.

 “Preparing for a disaster is no small task, especially for older adults managing health conditions and the caregivers who support them,” says Charlotte Mather-Taylor, CEO of AAABC. “Thanks to our community partners this conference helped equip caregivers and older adults with the tools they need to stay safe and resilient during emergencies.”

 As part of the sold-out conference, a two-part emergency preparedness session helped older adults and caregivers create a personalized response plan, understand available resources, and know what to expect during emergencies. Local experts from the American Red Cross, Broward County Transit, Memorial Healthcare System, the National Weather Service, Xtreme Crisis Healthcare (XCH), and other key agencies offered practical guidance. Session featured topics like hurricane preparation, emergency planning for caregivers, special needs shelter registration, Broward County’s Vulnerable Population Registry, pet-friendly shelter options, and transportation planning before and during a storm.

 AAABC also operates the Broward County Dementia Care and Cure Initiative Task Force, which develops dementia-caring communities in Broward County. For more information please visit https://www.adrcbroward.org/2025-empowering-caregivers-disaster-preparedness-conference.
