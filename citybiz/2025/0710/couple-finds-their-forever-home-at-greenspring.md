# Couple Finds Their ‘Forever Home’ At Greenspring

After living at a 55-plus community in Dumfries, Va., for six years, Gary and Sharon Hagan decided to explore other senior living options in Virginia.

 The Hagans were already familiar with Greenspring, an Erickson Senior Living community in Springfield, Va., for a couple reasons.

 “Gary and I bought our first house in Springfield, just five miles away from Greenspring, and lived there for 25 years,” says Sharon, who also attended monthly Daughters of the American Revolution meetings at the community.

 “I always loved the beautiful campus, but I didn’t think about the community as a future home–until I was leaving a meeting in June 2023, when several of the women began talking about how much they loved living there,” she explains. “One lady spoke up, saying that her only regret is that she wished she had moved to Greenspring sooner, and everyone agreed.”

 Sharon continues, “Boy, did the bells go off for me! I went home and told Gary that I thought we should consider Greenspring, so we called and scheduled an appointment.”

 Love at first sight

 During their appointment, Gary and Sharon met with Greenspring’s sales team and decided to join the Priority List, which would save their place in line for their preferred floor plan.

 “They asked us what we were looking for in terms of our residence. Originally, I had said I’d like a home that faced the woods,” recalls Sharon. “However, when we came back for our second appointment, I had reconsidered. As an artist and wildlife illustrator, I said that a home filled with natural light was more important.”

 Upon sharing these new preferences, the sales team asked the couple if they’d like to tour a Jackson floor plan–a two-bedroom, two-bath residence–that was being updated.

 “Even though it was a work in progress, we fell in love with the many windows, filling the home with natural light,” says Sharon. “We knew, right then and there, that it was the home we wanted. That day, we signed on the dotted line.”

 Making the move

 With only a few months before their new home would be ready, the Hagans started preparing for their move right away.

 “Because of Greenspring’s popularity, we thought we would have a much longer wait, but it all happened so quickly. It really felt like it was meant to be,” says Sharon. “As soon as we returned to our house, Gary began packing up his books.”

 To streamline their move, Gary and Sharon utilized the community’s planning and moving resources–a perk of Priority List membership.

 “As a result, on the day we moved, our home was set up in no time,” she recalls. “The movers knew exactly where to put things. They even made my bed, set up my art table, and placed my easel in front of the wide bedroom windows, offering plenty of sunlight to complete my work.”

 And since the residence was still under construction while they were packing, Gary and Sharon were able to step into a new home with fresh paint, flooring, and carpeting, which they chose themselves.

 A carefree lifestyle

 In the two years since their move, the Hagans have found that the vibrant, worry-free lifestyle at Greenspring is even better than they imagined.

 “It’s heaven here!” says Sharon. “Gary no longer has to worry about shoveling our driveway or hiring someone to clean our gutters or fix the roof. Greenspring offers so many conveniences. When we don’t want to go to dinner in a restaurant, we can have it delivered or pick it up. We also enjoy the buses that take us to and from various shopping areas.”

 Sharon, who admits to being the more social of the two, regularly visits the fitness center, participates in chair yoga classes, and does aquatic exercises in the saltwater pool. She is also a member of the art and book clubs.

 And with a medical center and continuing care neighborhood on campus, Gary and Sharon appreciate that so many health care services are readily available.

 “While living in Dumfries, we became dissatisfied with the health care in the area,” Sharon recalls. At Greenspring, “We signed up for the medical center and many of the specialists that visit each month.”

 Don’t wait

 Reflecting on their move to Greenspring, Sharon only has one regret: “I wish we’d moved sooner!”

 She adds, “I’m so glad we moved. Greenspring was meant to be our forever home.”
