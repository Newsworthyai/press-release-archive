# Baltimore Arts Realty Corp. Celebrates 10 Years of Motor House

Nonprofit announces series of events to celebrate Motor House’s legacy as a hub for artists, creatives, and community on the heels of recent vehicle incident

 Baltimore Arts Realty Corporation (BARCO), the nonprofit developer behind the creative hub Motor House, will host a series of fundraising events to celebrate its 10-year anniversary including two, community-wide rent party this evening, July 10 from 4:00-9:00 p.m., and on August 14 from 6:00-9:00 p.m., in direct response to the recent incident in which a vehicle struck the front of the building, damaging the main entrance and interior Showroom doors.

 “We were fortunate to only have to close for a few days, but the challenges are far from over,” said Tori Martin, Program Director, BARCO. “While we’re back in operation, we’re still facing the financial burden of repairing the damage caused by the vehicle collision.”

 Tonight’s event at Showroom will help raise funds to repair the damage, support staff and programming, and kick off fundraising efforts for the venue’s 10-year anniversary.

 “It’s an unexpected and untraditional way to kick off our fundraising efforts and celebratory events,” added Martin. “We’re incredibly thankful to the community, who have reached out in the days since the accident.”

Housed in a renovated 1914 automotive showroom, the venue includes gallery spaces, a black box theater, offices, a showroom and affordable studios for local artists. Since opening in 2015, it has become a vital gathering place for performers, visual artists and neighborhood residents.

 With a mission rooted in the culture of Baltimore, Motor House fosters bold ideas and emerging voices at the intersection of arts and community. It envisions a world where creatives are empowered to thrive, using its space to connect, inspire and celebrate the city’s diverse artistic identity.

 “Celebrating 10 years of Motor House is a milestone that reflects BARCO’s commitment to developing spaces where art and community intersect,” said Leon F. Pinkett III, CEO and Executive Director, BARCO. “We are a people-centric developer dedicated to ensuring that artists and neighborhoods not only have a place to create but the support they need to thrive—turning spaces into vibrant, lasting communities.”

 Following the rent party tonight and a second one being planned on August 14, the celebration continues Aug. 15-16 during Fashion Meets Art Weekend, featuring runway shows, workshops, artist-led classes and networking opportunities. The weekend will highlight the intersection of fashion and the arts in Baltimore.

 A private VIP reception will be held Oct. 9 for funders and key supporters. The evening will include a sneak peek of a new documentary short on Motor House and its impact over the past decade.

 The celebration continues with a public event Oct. 10, featuring a wide range of artistic expressions that highlight the variety of genres within each art form — offering something for everyone, including performances, food and installations. The trailer of the documentary short will also be shown at the public event.

 The festivities conclude Nov. 1 with a screening of the full documentary short at Motor House’s Black Box Theater. A talkback with BARCO leadership to discuss the next decade of Motor House is planned to follow the screening, and a special guest emcee may be announced later.

 “Motor House has emerged as a cultural anchor in Station North and a vital force in Baltimore’s creative resurgence,” said Tonya Miller Hall, Senior Advisor for Arts and Culture in the Baltimore Mayor’s Office. “Over the past decade, it has nurtured artists, elevated voices, and provided a space for bold expression and collective imagination. Its impact on our arts ecosystem is undeniable — it’s a home for creatives, a hub of innovation, and a launchpad for what’s next. Congratulations to the Motor House team on ten transformative years of artistic excellence and community building.”

 “It was transformative for GBCA to move into the Motor House,” said Jeannie Howe, Executive Director of the Greater Baltimore Cultural Alliance, whose organization was among the first tenants of Motor House. “Having a professional space validated us and made us feel seen. The third floor was bustling with people and organizations doing similar work, and our open‑door policy fostered partnerships and cohesion. And, of course, the artists were at the heart of it all! BARCO truly fulfilled its mission of creating a community and a thriving creative hub.”

 “Jane Brown and Neil Didriksen’s vision paired with Amy Bonitz’s leadership helped make Motor House a reality,” said Leon F. Pinkett III, CEO and Executive Director, BARCO. “Together with the support of the entire team at the Robert W. Deutsch Foundation, they created a space that continues to uplift and celebrate Baltimore’s creative community.”

 Motor House, located in the Station North Arts District, has served as a multidisciplinary arts hub since BARCO’s founding in 2015. For more information about the anniversary events, visit www.motorhousebaltimore.com/10year.
