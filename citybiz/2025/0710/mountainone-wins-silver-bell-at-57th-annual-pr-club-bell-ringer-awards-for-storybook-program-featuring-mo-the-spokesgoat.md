# MountainOne Wins Silver Bell at 57th Annual PR Club Bell Ringer Awards for Storybook Program Featuring Mo, the Spokesgoat

MountainOne is the proud recipient of a Silver Bell Ringer Award, announced during the 57th Annual PR Club Bell Ringer Awards ceremony, held June 3rd at the Museum of Science in Boston. The Bell Ringer Awards recognize public relations and communications work that demonstrates excellence in creative planning and superior execution.

 MountainOne earned Silver in the Communications Campaigns – Content Marketing category for its Mo’s Storybook Program, a multi-faceted initiative promoting financial literacy and personal growth among children. Central to the program is the original 24-page illustrated book, “How to Climb a Mountain,” featuring Mo the MountainOne Spokesgoat. The campaign also included strategic marketing, public relations, and community outreach efforts designed to bring Mo’s message to life.

 Over the past year, Mo has shared his storybook at more than 20 live readings across the Berkshires and South Shore, visiting schools, libraries, and community centers. To date, more than 2,000 copies of “How to Climb a Mountain” have been distributed, earning enthusiastic praise from educators, parents, and young readers alike.

 Following the program’s initial success, MountainOne recently launched “Something to Save,” the second book in the series, continuing its mission to empower kids through storytelling and smart financial habits.

 “We’re incredibly proud to see Mo’s Storybook Program recognized with this Silver Bell Award,” said Jill Amato, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Community Banking at MountainOne. “What began as a creative way to promote reading and financial literacy has truly grown into something special. These books help spark meaningful conversations with kids about confidence, goal-setting, and smart saving habits.”

 MountainOne extends its gratitude to HATCH The Agency, storybook author Doug Murphy, illustrator Laura Salafia, and PRfirst for their integral roles in bringing Mo’s storybook to life.

 The Bell Ringer Awards ceremony brought together leading PR and marketing professionals from across the region. Founded in 1948, PR Club is one of the nation’s oldest nonprofit public relations organizations, committed to advancing excellence in the communications industry.
