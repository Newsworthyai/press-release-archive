# HG Insights Unveils New IT Spend Report: The Ultimate 2025 B2B Market Forecast

HG Insights, the provider of AI-powered, go-to-market insights to 90% of Fortune 500 tech companies, today announced the release of its latest IT Spend Report: The Ultimate 2025 B2B Market Forecast. Among an array of revealing findings, the report projects that external IT spending is expected to approach $5 trillion for the first time.

 Companies have begun protecting their IT budgets in recent years, prioritizing investments in IT to ride out increasingly challenging market conditions. Despite intensifying global economic volatility, unrest, and fluctuating trade restrictions, IT solutions spending continues its trend of YoY growth.

 HG Insights’ third annual report takes a bird’s-eye view of the IT industry and highlights how the effects of trends like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and increased data center demand impact the four IT categories of Software, Hardware, Services, and Communications. It also offers insight into their respective spending forecasts, subcategories, and regional variations.

 High-level takeaways from each section of the report include:

 * $1.5 trillion in Global Software spend is projected over the next 12 months, with the subcategories of ERP Applications, Industry-Specific Applications, Security and Operations Management experiencing significant investment.
* $2.1 trillion in global spend in IT Services is expected, with notable growth in subcategories like Cloud Services, Application-Led Outsourcing, and IT Consulting.
* $757 billion is projected in the IT Hardware market, with Client Computing, Server Computing, and Network Infrastructure as the largest categories.
* $470 billion in IT Communications spend is expected, primarily driven by Mobile Services and Fixed Data.

 Total IT Spend Forecast

 HG Insights has identified 16 million businesses spending money on IT, with a total value projected to be $4.8 trillion from July, 2025 to July, 2026. Gartner forecasts that global IT spend will reach $5.6 trillion in 2025, however, that value includes consumer spending while HG Insights factors in enterprise-only spend.

 * $2.05 trillion in AMER spend (North, Central, and South America)
* $1.59 trillion in APAC spend (Asia-Pacific)
