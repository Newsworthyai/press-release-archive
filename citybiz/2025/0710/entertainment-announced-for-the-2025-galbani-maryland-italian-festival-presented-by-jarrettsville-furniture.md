# Entertainment Announced for the 2025 Galbani Maryland Italian Festival Presented by Jarrettsville Furniture

Headliners include national acts honoring music legends and Italian American heritage

 The Society of Italian American Businessmen (SIAB) today announced the highly-anticipated entertainment lineup for the 2025 Galbani Maryland Italian Festival presented by Jarrettsville Furniture.

 Due to significant growth since the festival’s launch in 2023, organizers announced in March that the event will move to a larger venue—the parking lot of Ripken Stadium in Aberdeen, Maryland.

 Set to take place September 26–28, 2025, this year’s festival will showcase an exciting mix of nationally recognized talent, celebrating both music legends and Italian American heritage.

 “The entertainment this year is a true celebration of Italian American culture, past and present,” said Joseph Papa, President of SIAB and co-chair of the Festival. “We’re proud to present a lineup that blends nostalgia, tradition, and world-class talent for attendees of all ages.”

 Friday Night Headliner – Blond Ambition: A Tribute to Madonna Kicking off the weekend with energy and nostalgia, Blond Ambition brings the Queen of Pop’s biggest hits to the main stage. Hailing from Tampa, Florida, this nationally acclaimed Madonna tribute act is known for its dazzling costumes, choreography, and authentic sound that perfectly captures the spirit of the 1980s and ’90s.

 Saturday Night Headliner – Ray Massa’s Eurorhythms Back by popular demand, Ray Massa’s Eurorhythms will headline Saturday night. Based in Columbus, Ohio, the group blends traditional Italian classics with modern pop and swing influences, making them one of the most beloved Italian American bands in the U.S.

 Sunday Headliner – Rat Pack Together Again Closing out the festival on Sunday, a toast to the Rat Pack takes you on a musical journey featuring the greatest hits from the legendary Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr. The Rat Pack will be accompanied with their big six-piece band.

 The three-day, family-friendly festival will feature a variety of live entertainment, authentic Italian cuisine and beverages, cultural exhibits, cooking demonstrations, family activities, and more.

 Back by popular demand, this year’s festival will once again host the two-day bocce tournament. On Saturday, teams will compete for cash prizes, while on Sunday, athletes from the Maryland Special Olympics will compete in their annual bocce tournament. Proceeds from the event support the Society of Italian American Businessmen’s charitable mission, with a focus on education, family and child services, mental health resources, and addiction recovery.

 The Galbani Maryland Italian Festival presented by Jarrettsville Furniture and hosted by the Society of Italian American Businessmen, is made possible thanks to the generous support of its sponsors—including media partners CBS Baltimore and 100.7 The Bay.
