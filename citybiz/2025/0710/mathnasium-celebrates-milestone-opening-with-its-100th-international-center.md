# Mathnasium Celebrates Milestone Opening with Its 100th International Center

* Landmark Center Opens in Hammersmith, United Kingdom

 * UK Becomes Mathnasium’s Largest Market Outside of the U.S., Boasting 37 Centers

 * Surging Global Demand For Supplemental Math Education Accelerates Franchise Expansion Abroad

 Mathnasium Learning Centers, a globally recognized franchise with over 1,200 locations across 12 countries, reaches a pivotal milestone: opening its 100th international center. The landmark location is in the vibrant Hammersmith neighborhood of West London, United Kingdom, cementing Britain as Mathnasium’s largest international market outside of North America. The timing couldn’t be more critical, with the new center launching just ahead of the 2025-26 academic year as parents seek intensive support to close achievement gaps that continue to impact student performance.

 This expansion comes as global demand for supplemental math education continues to surge, driven by factors including lingering pandemic learning loss, explosive growth in STEM careers, and increased parental awareness of math’s critical role in future success.

 “Reaching 100 international centers isn’t just about growth; it’s about meeting a critical need for supplemental math education that truly works,” said Tyler Sgro, CEO of Mathnasium. “Our method empowers children to build confidence and understanding, which sets the foundation for their future success. This milestone reflects our commitment to expanding access and making a real difference in communities worldwide — especially in fast-growing markets like the UK, where demand for high-quality math education continues to rise.”

 The 100th international Mathnasium center in Hammersmith is owned by Dan Tregoning, a father of two and multi-unit franchisee since 2020. In addition to Hammersmith, he operates centers in Fulham and Notting Hill, with a fourth location currently in development. The Hammersmith territory encompasses approximately 20,000 students across 30 schools, making it an ideal area to help children build a strong foundation in math and develop a lasting love for learning.

 “Opening the Hammersmith center is a proud milestone for me personally, and it’s made even more special by the fact that it marks the opening of Mathnasium’s 100th international center,” said Tregoning. “With demand for math support only growing, families need reliable access to programs that deliver real results. My background in educational real estate and early learning has shown me how critical it is to reach children at the right time, and Mathnasium does exactly that. We’re helping kids build confidence, competence, and a lifelong appreciation for math.”

 Mathnasium’s International Reach Hits New Heights

 * With 37 centers serving over 3,000 students, the UK is now the largest market outside of North America. This marks just the latest achievement for Mathnasium in Britain after being named the 2024 Franchise of the Year by the British Franchise Association last year.

 * On June 1, nearly 7,000 students celebrated “Mathnasium Day” at the Ho Chi Ming City and Hanoi locations in Vietnam — participating in summer festival-themed activities that blended math, creativity, and fun.

 * Earlier this year, Mathnasium also opened its first center in Romania.

 * Momentum remains strong globally, with new centers expected to open in Romania, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Mexico, and the UK by the end of 2025.

 * Mathnasium is targeting rapid international expansion in markets such as Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and Poland to meet increasing global demand for quality math education.

 “Mathnasium’s expanding presence in the UK and beyond reflects a strong and growing global demand for effective supplemental math education,” said Benjamin Simon, Regional Vice President of International at Mathnasium. “Our proven, hands-on approach continues to resonate with families and communities worldwide, reinforcing our commitment to empower children with the confidence and skills they need to thrive. As we broaden our reach, we’re excited to bring our brand’s mission to more students and support their success on a global scale.”

 The new Mathnasium of Hammersmith center opened its doors to students in May 2025, launching its goal of giving children the power to achieve excellence — in math and in life. A grand opening event is scheduled for this fall, inviting the community to experience firsthand how Mathnasium builds kids’ mathematical skills and confidence.

 With prime territories available, Mathnasium provides franchisees with an affordable entry point with quick build out time, a comprehensive initial training program with ongoing support, access to proprietary software tools and resources, and a balanced approach between corporate and locally driven marketing.
