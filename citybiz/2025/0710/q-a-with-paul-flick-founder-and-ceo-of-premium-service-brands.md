# Q&amp;A with Paul Flick, Founder and CEO of Premium Service Brands

Paul Flick is the founder and CEO of Premium Service Brands (PSB), a leading franchisor of niche home services brands, including 360° Painting, ProLift Garage Doors, and Maid Right, with over 1,000 locations across the U.S. and Canada. He started PSB in 2006 with the launch of 360° Painting and has since expanded it into a powerhouse in the home services industry, helping entrepreneurs build successful businesses.

 A dedicated philanthropist, Paul also founded the nonprofit Kids Lift in 2008, driven by his personal experience raising his daughter- Anne — who was born with Trisomy 18, to support children in need and promote inclusivity.

 The housing market has shifted in a major way this year, with sellers outnumbering buyers for the first time in over a decade. How is that impacting demand for home services? Are you seeing sellers invest differently in home prep compared to previous years?

 We are not currently seeing sellers outnumbering buyers; the real estate market remains very strong. Homeowners with low-interest mortgages are choosing to update their homes rather than sell.

 Your company leads a portfolio of home service franchises ranging from handyman work to painting and cleaning. Why is home services franchising uniquely well-positioned for this market moment?

 Customers are looking for home service providers who can offer certainty and deliver on their promises. We provide that certainty through our call center, technology, and properly trained franchise partners.

 Many entrepreneurs are looking for businesses that are resilient to economic shifts. What makes home services franchising a recession-resistant opportunity?

 For the average American, their home is their largest and most emotional investment. Given the choice, people will prioritize investing in their homes over discretionary spending like vacations.

 How does the rise of pre-listing home improvements tie into broader franchising trends you’re seeing at Premium Service Brands?

 Pre-listing home improvements represent a small part of our business. These jobs tend to be smaller than average and are typically more cosmetic in nature.

 You’ve long been a proponent of multi-brand ownership through PSB. How does this approach help franchisees meet today’s consumer demand more efficiently?

 Consumers prefer to work with providers they trust and who consistently deliver on their word. If a franchise partner provides a great experience for a customer, that customer is likely to utilize the franchise partner’s other available services.

 What should aspiring franchisees consider if they’re thinking about getting into the home services space right now?

 Aspiring franchisees need to be 100% committed, have sufficient working capital to invest based on their goals, and be willing to follow our established system. The most successful franchisees also approach the business with a long-term mindset and are focused on building strong community relationships and scaling thoughtfully over time.

 Looking ahead to the next 6-12 months, what do you expect to see in terms of growth or change across the home services and franchising industries?

 Given the current housing shortage in the country, I anticipate a very robust home service industry. Homeowners have built up significant equity in their homes, and they will continue to protect that investment through home services.
