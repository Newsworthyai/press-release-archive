# Social Gatherings Connect Lantern Hill’s Priority List Members

Vivian Lee realized that it was time to sell her 100-year-old house when her longtime handyman retired. “It was an old house, and I did not want to take care of it by myself,” she recalls.

 So, she began researching a few 55-plus communities near her house in Madison, N.J.–until a friend pointed out that, eventually, she would have to move again if she needed more support in the future.

 “I wanted this to be my last move,” says Vivian, whose search was quickly redirected–for the better. “My friend’s daughter, who is a physical therapist, told me about a new retirement community being built.”

 That community was Lantern Hill, the Erickson Senior Living community in New Providence, N.J.

 “It was only five miles away, and the [sales team] informed me that I could join the Priority List to attend events and learn more about the community,” she says. “Plus, the Priority List deposit was completely refundable, so there was nothing to lose!”

 After learning more about Lantern Hill’s maintenance-free residences, array of amenities, and on-site health care services, Vivian knew she had found the community for her.

 Knowledge is power

 Sales Director Kate Tanis notes that for many prospective residents, getting to know Lantern Hill and everything it has to offer helps them make an informed decision they’re truly comfortable with.

 “We encourage Priority List members to attend as many events as possible,” she says. “The informational events on areas such as finance, health care, continuing care, and downsizing are very popular. At our ‘Meet the Experts’ series, they can speak with community leaders like the medical director and the executive director.”

 Virtual events

 Lantern Hill also hosts several exclusive virtual events, which are recorded so members who couldn’t attend live can watch them later at their leisure.

 “We have a monthly webinar called ‘Get Connected,’ where we bring in staff members from different departments to talk to members. Links to the recordings are shared via the Priority List newsletter,” she explains.

 Vivian notes that Sales Counselor Carlos Aguilera was especially helpful in making appointments for her to meet with staff members personally and learn more.

 “I wanted to plan for my future,” she says. “Carlos set me up to meet the head of continuing care, Ryan Fitzpatrick, now Lantern Hill’s associate executive director, to discuss what the next levels of care would be, if I needed them.” She adds, “I learned so much during my time on the Priority List!”

 Time to connect

 In addition to getting the inside scoop on Lantern Hill, Priority List members can meet future neighbors and connect with current residents through engaging, social events.

 Vivian took advantage of this opportunity as well.

 “[A resident and I] had some meals together, and she was so honest and helpful,” she recalls. “When I mentioned that the afternoon sun made the back of my house too hot for me during the summers, it was her idea for me to request an apartment that did not have a southern exposure. I am so happy that Lantern Hill connected us.”

 Making new friends

 “Many people join the Priority List to make new friends,” notes Tanis. “Since current residents also attend the events, Priority List members can ask questions to hear firsthand from someone already living the life.”

 Tanis adds that her team has started planning Priority List events that are tailored to specific audiences, such as a Baby Boomers club, a singles get-together, and an LGBTQ+ Happy Hour, so members who share common interests or backgrounds can connect.

 Vivian spent over 30 years working for AT&T, so she was thrilled to learn that several Lantern Hill residents also worked there. “It was comforting to know that there was a community of people who I could relate to with similar professional backgrounds,” she says.

 Lots to enjoy

 Since moving to Lantern Hill, Vivian has been loving her maintenance-free residence, the array of amenities outside her door, and the on-site health care services.
