# “Go Fund Yourself” Showcases XOOX and CyBase AI: Two Startup Visions, One High-Stakes Pitch

On July 10th, Cheddar TV’s Go Fund Yourself airs its latest episode featuring two dramatically different but equally compelling early-stage companies: XOOX, a premium backpack brand blending design and technology, and CyBase AI, a cybersecurity innovator tackling one of the biggest challenges facing small and mid-sized businesses today.

 Now in its second season, Go Fund Yourself has quickly earned a reputation as one of the most entrepreneur-friendly pitch shows on TV, not only giving founders a shot at investment from the show’s “Titans” but also opening the door to public investment through its equity crowdfunding model. It’s a rare level of transparency in early-stage funding that resonates with today’s investors—and this week’s episode delivered on that promise.

 

 XOOX: Elevating Everyday Carry

 First into the spotlight was XOOX, a startup intent on redefining the backpack market. In an era where consumers expect their gear to do more than carry items, XOOX is betting on a high-quality, handcrafted approach paired with built-in entertainment features.

 Each XOOX backpack is made from the finest materials, with stylish straps and handles. But it’s not just about luxury aesthetics. The team’s vision is to turn backpacks into entertainment, suggesting integrations that align with the mobile, connected lifestyle of urban professionals and students alike.

 From a business perspective, XOOX represents the kind of premium direct-to-consumer opportunity investors often chase. Margins on high-end accessories can be substantial, brand differentiation is critical, and their pitch highlighted plans to lean into design, storytelling, and e-commerce channels to create a defensible niche.

 During the episode, the Titans questioned the founder about unit economics, production scalability, and marketing strategy—key considerations for any consumer brand looking to move from artisanal to mainstream. They applauded the answers!

 CyBase AI: Making Cybersecurity Accessible

 The second founder to pitch was Angel Mosley, the powerhouse CEO and founder behind CyBase AI. Nicknamed “The Cyber Fire Chief,” Mosley brought decades of enterprise risk management and incident response expertise to the table.

 Her latest venture, CyFireAI, is a platform designed to give small and mid-sized businesses access to advanced incident response and cyber crisis planning. It’s a mission that couldn’t be more timely, given the explosion of ransomware attacks and growing regulatory pressure on even the smallest companies to secure customer data.

 Mosley’s pitch didn’t just focus on technology. She also highlighted the economic opportunity in serving a market that’s chronically underserved. While large enterprises often have in-house security teams and consultants, most SMBs don’t. CyFireAI aims to bridge that gap with an affordable, easy-to-implement solution.

 Angel’s broader commitment to the industry was also on display. As the founder of the nonprofit CyberSecurity GameChangers, she’s invested in training the next generation of cyber professionals—underscoring a founder-led brand that’s about both profit and impact.

 The Titans’ questions drilled into pricing strategy, market segmentation, and competitive differentiation. While the panel was clearly impressed with Angel’s experience, they challenged her to clarify how CyBase AI would achieve broad adoption and customer retention in a crowded security market. They were happy to hear the plans for growth. Interested investors can learn more here: https://wefunder.com/cyfireai

 The Titans’ Value Beyond Capital

 

 As always, Go Fund Yourself shines in its ability to pair funding with mentorship. Titans like Rory Cutaia, David Meltzer, and Jayson Waller don’t just evaluate companies for investment—they pressure-test ideas, challenge assumptions, and open their networks to help founders scale.

 This episode was a master class in founder-investor dynamics: the blend of storytelling, strategic planning, and operational know-how needed to move a business from idea to investment-ready.

 For viewers and prospective investors, Episode 7 of Go Fund Yourself highlighted two different but compelling startup stories—one rooted in lifestyle branding, the other in essential enterprise technology. It’s a reminder that great ideas can come from anywhere, and with the right guidance, they can go everywhere.
