# TruckIT Partners and Bolton Capital Partner to Help Dump Truck Haulers Grow

TruckIT, the market-leading technology provider for digitizing and optimizing the bulk hauling supply chain, announced a strategic partnership with Bolton Capital, a specialized financial services firm focused on the needs of dump truck haulers. Together, the two Atlanta-based companies are committed to solving one of the industry’s most persistent challenges—cash flow—and empowering haulers to get paid faster, take on more work and grow their businesses.

 By integrating Bolton Capital’s rapid payment capabilities with TruckIT’s advanced digital platform, users can now experience a seamless transition from job completion to cash in the bank. TruckIT users simply submit their invoices via the platform, and Bolton’s ticket-matching technology ensures instant verification and payment.

 Accession Distribution, based in Riverdale, GA—was among the first hauling companies to take advantage of the TruckIT/Bolton partnership.

 “Getting funded as fast as within 4 to 5 hours has given us enormous flexibility and freedom, ” said Juanita Marry, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer at Accession Distribution. “The support has also helped us sign new business, both due to the dispatch and ticketing visibility from TruckIT and offering better billing terms to customers due to the support from Bolton. I highly recommend that any hauler get on board as soon as possible.”

 The TruckIT/Bolton program is tailored specifically for companies that:

 * Provide bulk hauling for construction, waste, agricultural or energy industries
* Manage jobs and heavy equipment across multiple sites
* Need fast cash for working capital

 “We understand the unique challenges that dump truck operators face, specifically around cash flow and growth” said Douglas Lindsay, Co-Founder and Managing Partner, Bolton Capital. “This partnership allows us to go beyond software and deliver working capital directly into the hands of our customers. Bolton and TruckIT are committed to helping our customers improve operational efficiency, invest in new assets, and maintain great relationships with their subcontractors.”

 The U.S. dump truck services segment—which includes hauling materials like gravel, demolition debris, and waste—was estimated at approximately $30 billion in 2024. The National Dump Truck Association (NDTA) expects these numbers to rise significantly with the passage of H.R.1 which significantly increases domestic investment in infrastructure, defense, energy and more.

 “The dump truck industry is highly fragmented, and operators are looking for the kind of support that TruckIT and Bolton Capital can provide,” said Malcolm Smith, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, NDTA. “With manual tickets still prevalent in the industry, accounts receivable timelines can stretch to 60–70 days from delivery to actual cash receipt, which can negatively impact growth and operational decisions.

 “We need healthy companies with the flexibility to take on any kind of project without concern for variable accounts receivable timelines.”

 “TruckIT’s suite of tools—including Optimized Dispatch, E-Ticketing, and business intelligence—already enables haulers and contractors to streamline workflows and increase efficiency,” said Pace Davis, President, TruckIT. “Adding Bolton Capital to the offering strengthens the value proposition, especially for small to mid-sized businesses looking to scale without added overhead and risk.”
