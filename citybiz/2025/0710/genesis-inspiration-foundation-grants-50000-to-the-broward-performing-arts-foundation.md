 “Genesis Inspiration Foundation is dedicated to empowering young people to experience an education through the arts,” said John Guastaferro, executive director, Genesis Inspiration Foundation. “We are grateful to work with nonprofit partners like Broward Performing Arts Foundation to increase accessibility, spark imagination, and bring the transformative power of the arts to more children across the country.”

 “We appreciate the generosity of the Genesis Inspiration Foundation in supporting all that we do for students in our community,” said Senator George S. LeMieux, Broward Performing Arts Foundation Board Chair. “Through our programming we are educating, inspiring, and touching the lives of more than 105,000 students annually.”

 The donation was celebrated with special guests at the Rose Miniaci Arts Education Center on the Broward Center campus. Guests included Robert Vinson, Senior Manager, Regional Marketing Operations, Genesis Motor America, and Ryan Case of Rick Case Automotive Group, who represented the Genesis automotive dealers in South Florida. They enjoyed a sneak peek of some Broward Center Summer Theater Camp sessions and were treated to a dynamic performance of “Supercali-fragilisticexpialidocious” from the talented teens in the Young Professionals student group who are preparing for their production of Mary Poppins Jr. on stage in early July at the Broward Center’s Amaturo Theater.

 The Rose Miniaci Arts Education Center, which opened in the fall of 2014, houses classrooms and a coaching studio, integrated technologies for distance learning and the JM Family Studio for teaching, rehearsals, recitals, camps and intimate performances. Programs are designed to encourage artistic expression and appreciation through the performing arts and include classes, workshops, master classes, performances and lectures for children, teens and adults of all ages.

 For nearly 40 years, the Broward Performing Arts Foundation has been instrumental in providing support for the Broward Center for the Performing Arts. The Foundation was established in 1985 to deliver the required private funding to build the Center and create an endowment to sustain its operations. Over the years, the Foundation has successfully raised funds to support the Broward Center’s innovative and diverse programming, arts-in-education initiatives, community engagement activities and capital projects. In the decade between 2010 and 2020, the Foundation successfully completed two capital campaigns raising nearly $100 million to restore, renovate and renew the Broward Center campus and the Parker Playhouse (now known as The Parker).
