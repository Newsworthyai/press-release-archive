 How has your military service directly contributed to your effectiveness in managing DOD and federal sector operations at Kasm?

 With over 23 years of military service across the Non-Commissioned, Warrant, and Commissioned Officer ranks, I’ve gained firsthand experience navigating the complexities of defense operations, from tactical field communications and cyber to strategic acquisition planning. This operational depth, combined with my success as the founder of a federal contracting startup that scaled from 1 to over 325 employees before an acquisition exit, directly assists my ability to lead and deliver results at Kasm.

 My background provides for a mission-first mindset, a strong grasp of command structures, and an acute understanding of how to align technical capabilities with operational needs, all of which are essential in managing DoD and federal sector initiatives. At Kasm, I draw on this experience daily, engaging with stakeholders who expect domain fluency, anticipating compliance and security priorities, and building solutions that resonate with the unique tempo and culture of government clients. This alignment has proven critical in positioning Kasm as a trusted partner in high-stakes, mission-driven environments.

 What is Kasm Technologies?

 Kasm Technologies provides next-generation digital workspace solutions for customers that demand the highest levels of security and reliability. Kasm Technologies delivers a secure, unified workspace platform purpose-built to meet the dynamic needs of modern enterprises and government missions alike. Engineered for high performance, seamless scalability, and zero-trust security, the Kasm Workspaces platform empowers organizations to accelerate digital transformation, modernize their workforce, and maintain operational continuity in an increasingly distributed and threat-prone environment.

 For example, a federal agency responsible for nationwide program administration could leverage Kasm’s containerized workspace solution to quickly deploy a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) for remote employees during a large-scale continuity of operations event. Utilizing Kasm, the agency could provide staff with secure, role-based access to critical applications and data, all without the need for complex hardware provisioning or on-premise infrastructure within hours. This flexibility not only ensures business continuity and workforce productivity under challenging circumstances but also showcases the power of Kasm’s cloud-native architecture in supporting both day-to-day operations and large-scale mission responsiveness.

 What unique perspective does your military background bring to working with federal clients and understanding their needs?

 Having served as a former user, evaluator, and purchaser of technology solutions within the Department of Defense, I bring a comprehensive perspective on the unique demands facing the DoD and Federal Agencies. I understand the critical need to adopt cutting-edge technologies that enhance mission effectiveness while meeting the ongoing mandate to achieve more within a constrained environment.

 This experience enables me to collaborate closely with stakeholders at all levels, from frontline operators to senior leadership, to uncover the real-world challenges they encounter with their current virtual workspace environments. Instead of defaulting to a one-size-fits-all solution, we use these insights to develop a customized set of requirements that emphasizes user experience, security, and deployment agility. By aligning technical capabilities with the practical needs of the end users, this approach drives higher adoption rates, improved performance, and meaningful, mission-aligned outcomes.

 What has been the most rewarding part of working at Kasm, particularly in bridging your military experience with the private sector?

 The most rewarding part of working at Kasm has been the opportunity to contribute to team development by leveraging the leadership principles and operational mindset I gained through 23+ years of service. Throughout my career in the military and as a former founder and CEO of a Federal contracting company, I have had the privilege of mentoring, training, and leading diverse teams in high-pressure, mission-critical environments. That experience instilled in me a deep respect for cohesive team dynamics, clear communication, and shared accountability, all of which are vital in fast-moving, high-impact organizations.

 At Kasm, I have the opportunity to bring those values into the private sector and help shape a culture that reflects the best aspects of military teamwork. Kasm’s leadership has been deliberate in building a high-performing organization, and I’ve found great fulfillment in working with team members, fostering cross-functional collaboration, and helping cultivate a unified sense of purpose. Watching individuals align around a shared mission and consistently deliver for our clients has been one of the most meaningful aspects of my role. It’s a testament to what’s possible when leadership principles are applied in a modern tech environment. Kasm exemplifies a culture of excellence without ego, shared accountability, and an unwavering drive to serve our clients and one another.

 How do the leadership skills and strategic thinking you developed in the military translate to your current responsibilities in the federal contracting space?

 My extensive military experience and training across the Non-Commissioned, Warrant, and Commissioned Officer ranks have honed both my leadership skills and strategic thinking, two qualities that directly shape how I operate in the federal contracting space today. Leading teams in dynamic, high-stakes environments taught me how to make decisive, informed choices under pressure, build cohesive teams, and maintain focus on mission objectives amidst shifting priorities.

 These leadership principles translate directly into my current responsibilities, where I work with cross-functional teams, engage with stakeholders at all levels, and ensure our solutions meet both immediate operational needs and long-term strategic goals. Having the ability to assess complex environments, anticipate evolving mission requirements, and align our offerings with the DoD’s technological and budgetary priorities has been critical in delivering value to our federal clients.

 What are Kasm’s top innovation priorities for the coming year? How do they align with the evolving DOD and Federal sector needs?

 Kasm’s top innovation priorities for the coming year are focused on advancing zero-trust, cloud-native, and web-delivered services that align with the evolving needs of modern organizations, including those in the DoD and Federal sectors. As enterprises and government agencies alike move away from traditional hardened endpoints and legacy virtualization, Kasm is committed to delivering lightweight, scalable, and secure platforms that support this broader shift in operational and IT strategy.

 Some of our innovation priorities include:

 * Kubernetes-Based Services: We’re expanding orchestration capabilities on hyperconverged infrastructure such as Harvester, OpenStack, and KubeVirt. This supports the DoD’s push toward scalable, containerized workloads and infrastructure-as-code paradigms.
* Browser as the Endpoint: Kasm is advancing its NextGen KasmVNC technology to deliver full desktop and application experiences directly through the browser — eliminating endpoint complexity and aligning with modern BYOD and thin-client strategies.
* Zero-Trust Architecture: We’re rethinking access control by focusing security at the application level rather than the endpoint. Through support for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), ChromeOS, and other lightweight operating environments, Kasm is aligned with DoD’s zero-trust directives and Executive Order 14028.
* CMMC Compliance (CUI-ready services): Through our collaboration with ATX Defense and Google, we’re delivering the CMMC Space — a compliant environment purpose-built for Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) workloads, accelerating readiness for defense contractors and agencies.
* Smartcard and 2FA Integration for Web Services: We are enabling full support for smartcards, YubiKeys, and hardware tokens within browser-delivered environments, ensuring secure identity management in line with federal authentication standards.

 Together, these priorities support the modernization, agility, and security objectives of the federal space, enabling agencies to meet mission goals while adapting to increasingly distributed and complex IT environments.
