# Visits, Tours, And Overnight Stays Provide an Inside Look at Cedar Crest

When you’re exploring your senior living options, you want to be sure that you choose the right retirement community for you. You’ll likely find that visiting in person is the best way to know for sure if you can see yourself living there.

 Thanks to the insightful events, personal tours, and overnight stays offered at Cedar Crest, an Erickson Senior Living community in Pompton Plains, N.J., there are many options to choose from for your visit.

 “We loved what Cedar Crest had to offer,” says Rose Galeotti, who moved to Cedar Crest with her husband Steven last December after learning more about the community through sales events, informational luncheons, dinners with current residents, campus and residence tours, and more.

 “They really gave us an inside look at the community,” Steven says. “The more we visited, the more we liked it!”

 Lots of offerings

 Sales Counselor Jessica Cirelli notes that for many prospective residents, getting to know Cedar Crest and everything it has to offer helps them make an informed decision they’re truly comfortable with.

 “There are various ways to get to know Cedar Crest. For many, the first step is attending a sales event, which offers an introductory glimpse into the community,” Cirelli says. “Others schedule a personalized information session and tour as a first visit. After that, many people join the Priority List, which offers additional perks and special events.”

 Priority List members can take advantage of the Live the Life program, which offers several types of immersive visits. The overnight stays in a furnished guest suite, complete with planned activities and complimentary meals in Cedar Crest’s restaurants, are quite popular. Others opt for day visits, with the chance to eat lunch on campus and participate in a club or class.

 “Priority List members also have the unique opportunity to enjoy a complimentary meal with resident ambassadors,” Cirelli adds. “Hearing what it’s like to live at Cedar Crest, firsthand, is impactful.”

 “Talking to them and seeing how much they enjoyed living here,” Rose recalls, “that was really helpful.”

 An inside look

 After living in their house in nearby Bloomingdale, N.J., for 43 years, Rose and Steven were ready for a change. Drawn to Cedar Crest’s engaging environment and maintenance-free residences, they joined the Priority List.

 “We came to dinners and lunches. We enjoyed the walking tours, and we toured various apartments,” Steven says. “We took advantage of everything, getting a real good look.”

 He continues, “We saw people doing things; not sitting around. People playing cards, playing billiards, playing whatever!”

 “We saw bocce games and other outside activities,” Rose adds. “And the community itself is beautiful. The campus is so well-kept.”

 Cirelli echoes how valuable it is for prospective residents to tour campus and get a feel for life at Cedar Crest.

 “We encourage visitors to attend daytime events and walk through the community to see what residents are up to on a daily basis. In fact, many of our Priority List events focus on special campus happenings, often involving staff members and residents,” Cirelli says.

 Planning and moving

 When Rose and Steven decided that Cedar Crest was the right community for them, they began considering which floor plan would best suit their lifestyle. Cedar Crest offers more than a dozen one- and two-bedroom floor plan designs.

 “Touring residences can be really helpful,” explains Cirelli. “If you’ve been eyeing a one-bedroom, one-bath layout, but you seem to be missing a place for your craft table, stepping into a one-bedroom, one-bath with den residence during a tour can help you envision a new living and hobby space.”

 After touring and weighting their options, Rose and Steven decided that a two-bedroom residence–complete with two full baths, a spa tub, and large kitchen–was the best fit.

 And thanks to their Priority List status, the couple had the opportunity to work with Cedar Crest’s planning and moving consultant, Brandon Postlewaite, who provided assistance with space planning and a list of moving resources.

 “Brandon was terrific to work with in planning the furniture layout in our new apartment. He even made two home visits to help us get ready for our move,” Steven says.

 Come visit!

 Rose and Steven have no doubt that the visits, tours, events, and dinners they attended before moving in made them feel right at home.

 And now, their children and grandchildren feel right at home too, as they love visiting the community to share a meal and play billiards together.

 “If you’re interested in gaining an inside look at Cedar Crest, I recommend joining the Priority List,” says Cirelli. “There are so many perks that can help you envision enjoying a vibrant, worry-free lifestyle here!”
