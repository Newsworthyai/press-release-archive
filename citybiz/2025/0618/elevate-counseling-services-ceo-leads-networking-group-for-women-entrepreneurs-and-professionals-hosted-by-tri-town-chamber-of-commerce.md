# Elevate Counseling Services CEO Leads Networking Group for Women Entrepreneurs and Professionals Hosted by Tri-Town Chamber of Commerce

Monthly Zoom sessions facilitated by Leigh-Ann Larson

 Leigh-Ann Larson, CEO of Elevate Counseling Services, a practice of behavioral health care professionals serving the needs of clients via telehealth and from locations in Easton, Raynham, Lakeville, Franklin, Hopkinton, Buzzards Bay, and Seekonk, Massachusetts, and Rising Up, LLC, an online outpatient mental health program, is excited to facilitate “She Means Business” hosted by the Tri-Town Chamber of Commerce.

 The Tri-Town Chamber of Commerce promotes and champions business growth and vitality for those who live, visit, and work in the community. The chamber’s region encompasses Foxborough, Mansfield, and Norton, as well as the surrounding area.

 The one-hour monthly networking circle for women entrepreneurs and professionals takes place virtually via Zoom from 12-1 p.m. Each session starts with a mindful moment to help participants ground and center, followed by business, personal, and health updates. The group sessions foster conversations about leadership, strategy, and visionary topics, empowering attendees to enhance their business performance and success while staying aligned with personal responsibilities and values.

 “’She Means Business’ is much more than a networking circle – it’s a space where women entrepreneurs and professionals can pause, reflect, and refocus,” said Larson, a Licensed Mental Health Counselor and Intuitive Leadership Coach. “By cultivating meaningful conversations, we inspire each other to not only grow our businesses but also strengthen the foundation of our individual journeys.”

 For more information about “She Means Business” please visit www.tri-townchamber.org. The dynamic networking group is open to all women members of the Tri-Town Chamber of Commerce looking to connect with purpose and power.
