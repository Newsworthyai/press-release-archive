# Living At Ann’s Choice Is ‘Money Well Spent’

When Walt and Ruth Reller started exploring their senior living options, they were looking for a retirement community that offered financial stability and a worry-free lifestyle.

 “We looked at other communities, but we really liked Ann’s Choice,” says Walt of the Erickson Senior Living community in Bucks County, Pa. “The 90% refundable entrance fee* was attractive.”

 The couple was also impressed by the maintenance-free residences and the lush, 100-acre campus, boasting plenty of green space and outdoor activities.

 Since moving to Ann’s Choice, the Rellers have been able to manage their budget with confidence and spend more time doing what they enjoy.

 Predictable expenses

 For many retirees, financial predictability is a key consideration when choosing a retirement community. The pricing structure at Ann’s Choice–made up of a monthly service package and the 90% refundable entrance fee–is designed to provide exactly that.

 The monthly service package bundles the costs of most utilities; maintenance, including appliance repair and replacement; a meal plan at on-site restaurants; access to amenities; and regularly scheduled transportation into one predictable bill.

 The package supports the more than 90% of seniors who say they want predictable monthly expenses to cover most of their daily activities, meals, and housing–according to a recent survey commissioned by Erickson Senior Living via Edge Research.

 “It makes budgeting much easier,” says Walt. “Plus, I never have to climb a ladder to clean gutters or worry about snow removal.”

 He continues, “We have 20 meals a month included in our plan. Ruth enjoys cooking, and we like to eat out occasionally, so this flexibility works well for us.”

 Peace of mind

 Many residents especially appreciate the 90% refundable entrance fee–the heart of the community’s pricing structure. The entrance fee, collected as part of the residency process, will go back to you or your beneficiaries, if or when you leave the community.

 “The 90% refundable entrance fee allows residents to access their investment, if needed. And if the funds aren’t used, the 90% can be refunded to them or their heirs,” explains Ryan Doherty, sales director at Ann’s Choice. “It’s a smart way to preserve assets for the future.”

 The community’s fee-for-service model and Home for Life promise* provide additional peace of mind.

 “Because Ann’s Choice operates under a fee-for-service model, residents only pay for services they currently want or need,” says Finance Director Tom Walsh, noting that life care models require upfront payment for care you may never need. “Our model keeps more money in residents’ pockets.”

 And no one ever expects to run out of money, but sometimes unforeseen issues arise that can quickly deplete your hard-earned savings and put you at risk. At Ann’s Choice, we’ve planned for life’s uncertainties and are prepared to assist eligible residents who outlive their resources. No one will be asked to leave the community because of a genuine inability to pay.

 For Walt and Ruth, this benefit was a real draw.

 “One of the things we considered before moving was what would happen if we ran out of money,” he says. “It’s comforting to know that Ann’s Choice has thought through this and has a plan in place.”

 Added value

 Ann’s Choice isn’t just a smart financial investment–it’s also an investment in your quality of life. With access to seven restaurants, state-of-the-art fitness centers, an indoor aquatics center, libraries, a medical center, and a performing arts center, residents gain more than just a home; they gain a thriving community that supports their overall well-being.

 “There’s plenty to do here,” Walt shares. “I got involved with lifelong learning, and I’ve really enjoyed it. Ruth plays a lot of bridge and stays active. We both appreciate having a medical center on-site that understands the needs of seniors.”

 “Many prospective residents underestimate how much they’ll enjoy the benefits of community living,” says Doherty. “Residents develop close-knit relationships and take advantage of social opportunities, which are hard to replicate outside of a vibrant community like ours.”

 “What’s more, by continuously evaluating and investing in our services and amenities, we ensure a dynamic, engaging future for all of our residents,” says Walsh. “Right now, we are renovating the Keystone Clubhouse. Next, we’ll move on to the Liberty and Village Clubhouses.”

 ‘Money well spent’

 Celebrating 16 years at Ann’s Choice, the Rellers are happy with their home and confident in their investment.

 “We knew it was money well spent,” notes Walt.
