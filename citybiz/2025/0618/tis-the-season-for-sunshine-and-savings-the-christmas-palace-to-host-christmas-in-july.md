# ‘Tis the Season for Sunshine and Savings The Christmas Palace to Host Christmas in July

Who/What:

 Santa’s trading his sleigh for a surfboard! Santa is on vacation, visiting South Florida to celebrate the magic of Christmas in July at The Christmas Palace, the leading retailer for premium holiday decor in South Florida. On Saturday, July 12, in Miami and Sunday, July 13, in Fort Lauderdale, families are invited to a special free Christmas in July event celebration, South Florida–style.

 All the good little boys and girls will have the opportunity to snap selfies with Santa while he’s in vacation mode, rocking his summer shades and flip flops while relaxing in a beach chair against a sunny backdrop, giving out tropical candy canes. Attendees can also capture moments in the digital photo booth with summer-themed Christmas props.

 Big Kahuna Hawaiian Shaved Ice Food Truck will serve free, colorful shaved ice.

 In addition, Santa is starting to make his list and check it twice. Children can drop their wish lists off in Santa’s Mailbox, which Rudolph will take straight to the North Pole.

 Special offers available during this magical event include an additional 25% off the entire store and an extra 25% off any single item. The Christmas Palace is hosting hourly giveaways for summer, coastal-decorated trees, garland and wreaths, and Santa will be giving away a $500 gift card at each location.

 Guests are encouraged to bring new, unwrapped toys to support Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital patients through the rest of the year. These gifts allow Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital to continue living out its mission, “The power of play promotes positive healing.” Toys are used to celebrate major milestones such as birthdays and last chemo treatments, reward children for their courage and cooperation, and bring comfort and imagination into their healing journeys.

Its reputation for offering the largest and most tastefully decorated Christmas decor store in the region is unmatched.
