# Brooksby Village’s Predictable Costs Provide Freedom, Value, And Peace of Mind

When Barbara Hooper and her late husband Bill started researching their senior living options, they were looking for a community with a worry-free lifestyle.

 “We wanted to live an active and interesting way of life without the financial and physical worries of maintaining a house,” says Barbara.

 The couple heard great things about Brooksby Village, an Erickson Senior Living community in Peabody, Mass., from one of Bill’s friends, so they decided to attend a few informational luncheons on campus.

 “We were impressed by the casual, friendly atmosphere,” recalls Barbara, “but the main advantage of moving to Brooksby was that our apartment would be maintenance-free with no chores or unexpected costs.”

 Now, Barbara is able to manage her budget with confidence, knowing that maintenance is included in her monthly service package, and spend more time doing what she loves.

 Predictable and accessible

 In addition to maintenance, Brooksby’s monthly service package bundles all utilities, a meal plan at on-site restaurants, access to amenities, and regularly scheduled transportation into one predictable bill.

 “Bill always loved looking out the window and seeing someone else mow the lawn and shovel the snow. And I loved that I didn’t have to nag him to do those chores!” says Barbara, with a laugh.

 The package supports the more than 90% of seniors who say they want predictable monthly expenses covering most of their daily activities, meals, and housing–according to a recent survey commissioned by Erickson Senior Living via Edge Research.

 Many residents also appreciate the 90% refundable entrance fee*–the heart of the community’s pricing structure. The entrance fee, collected as part of the residency process, will go back to you or your beneficiaries, if or when you leave the community.

 And because the entrance fee is unique to each residence’s features, living at the sought-after community is more accessible than many people realize.

 “Brooksby boasts a range of one- and two-bedroom residences, which means we are able to accommodate many budgets,” says Executive Director Tracie Bettano. “People are often surprised by how much value they get for their money.”

 So much to gain

 Each residence is also just a short stroll away from the dozens of amenities located right on campus.

 “A move to Brooksby is money well spent, for many reasons,” notes Bettano. “There is so much added value–compared to staying in houses that become challenging to maintain or living in communities without a variety of restaurants, amenities, and activities. What’s more, by continuously evaluating and investing in our services and amenities, we ensure an engaging future for all of our residents.”

 Thanks to the walkable campus and regular shuttles, some residents like Barbara see no need to hold onto their cars–and the associated insurance costs.

 “Now that I’m no longer driving, Brooksby enables me to lead a full life and do all the activities I like to do,” says Barbara. “Bill was a ham radio operator and helped secure a ‘radio shack’ here with antennas for his group. They now talk to other radio operators in many parts of the world.”

 Barbara, a member of the Energy and Conservation Committee, became chair of the recycling subcommittee after learning about the importance of recycling. The committee recently launched a program for residents to collect their kitchen food scraps for composting.

 “One of the best things about Brooksby is the wide variety of activities and programs, and if you want to start a new program, staff members will help you get it started,” she says.

 Peace of mind

 Most of all, Barbara appreciates the peace of mind that comes from the Home for Life promise* and Brooksby’s continuing care options.

 No one ever expects to run out of money, but sometimes unforeseen issues arise that can quickly deplete your hard-earned savings and put you at risk. At Brooksby, we’ve planned for life’s uncertainties and are prepared to assist eligible residents who outlive their resources. No one will be asked to leave the community because of a genuine inability to pay.

 “We felt fortunate to live here, as Bill was able to be cared for in the continuing care neighborhood,” Barbara says. “This was just a short walk from our apartment through the enclosed walkways, so it was easy for me to go over–in any weather–and spend lots of time with him every day.”

 “It was a good decision to move here!” she adds.
