# At Riderwood, Predictable Costs Provide Freedom, Value, and Peace of Mind

When Joe and Beverly Limansky started researching their senior living options, they were looking for a community that offered financial stability and a vibrant, worry-free lifestyle.

 “We didn’t need–or want–to be taking care of a large house,” says Joe, noting that their former house in Boca Raton, Fla., was requiring more and more maintenance. “We also wanted to divest ourselves from the additional expenses that come with homeownership and were looking to change our lifestyle.”

 Boasting maintenance-free residences and access to state-of-the-art amenities, Riderwood, an Erickson Senior Living community in Silver Spring, Md., offered exactly what the Limanskys were looking for.

 Now, Joe and Beverly are managing their budget with confidence and making the most of their retirement!

 Predictable expenses

 Riderwood’s pricing structure has two components: the monthly service package and the 90% refundable entrance fee*.

 The monthly service package bundles the costs of utilities; a meal plan at on-site restaurants; maintenance, including repair and replacement of appliances; access to amenities; and regularly scheduled transportation into one predictable bill.

 In fact, the package supports the more than 90% of seniors who say they want predictable monthly expenses to cover most of their daily activities, meals, and housing–according to a recent survey commissioned by Erickson Senior Living via Edge Research.

 “Now, we simply pay one bill and it covers almost everything,” notes Joe. “And, since moving to Riderwood, there are far fewer bills to worry about, like pool maintenance, [property] taxes, HOA fees, and homeowners insurance.”

 Unbeatable value

 The 90% refundable entrance fee, collected as part of the residency process, goes back to you or your beneficiaries, if or when you leave the community. For the Limanskys, the 90% refundable entrance fee was a real draw.

 “When we began exploring retirement communities, the financial impact of the 90% refundable entrance fee became clear,” says Joe. “We learned that some of the other communities quickly chew up your money.”

 He continues, “For example, one community we looked at takes 2% from your deposit every month after the first 90 days. That means your entrance fee would be consumed in a little over four years! We appreciate the peace of mind the 90% refundable entrance fee provides ourselves and our family.”

 And because the entrance fee is unique to each residence’s features, living at the sought-after community is more accessible than many people realize.

 “We offer a range of one- and two-bedroom residences, which means we are able to accommodate many budgets. People are often surprised by how much value they get for their money,” says Sales Director Josh Runkles. “In addition, Riderwood is always looking for ways to reinvest in services and amenities, keeping our campus vibrant and up to date.”

 Over the last several years, Riderwood has updated three clubhouses and added a new outdoor fitness pavilion, multipurpose rooms, and several dining options.

 So much to gain

 Without the responsibility of maintenance and juggling bills, the Limanskys have gained more free time to pursue their hobbies and interests and explore the community’s amenities–at no additional cost.

 A state-of-the-art fitness center, an aquatics center with a pool and hot tub, eight restaurants, and a performing arts theater are just a short stroll from each residence–not to mention the 240-plus clubs and activities.

 “There’s a great lifestyle benefit that comes from moving to Riderwood,” says Beverly. “There is so much to do and so many people to enjoy activities with. It’s really unbelievable. Each day, we have to pick and choose what we want to do.”

 The couple enjoys filling their calendar with tai chi, square dancing, and a variety of exercise classes, including Exercise to the Latin Beat, at the fitness center. They are active members of Riderwood’s Community Synagogue, and Beverly is the resident greeter for their building. Joe is busy starting a mentoring group for Riderwood’s high school student servers.

 Peace of mind

 Most of all, Joe and Beverly appreciate the peace of mind thanks to the Home for Life promise.* No one ever expects to run out of money, but sometimes unforeseen issues arise that can quickly deplete your hard-earned savings and put you at risk. Riderwood is prepared to assist eligible residents who outlive their resources. No one will be asked to leave our community because of a genuine inability to pay.

 “It’s such an important benefit as we get older,” says Joe. “In every way, Riderwood has exceeded our expectations.”
