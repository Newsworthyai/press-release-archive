# Generous Ashby Ponds Residents Support Students Futures Through Scholarship Fund

Fifty local high school students, soon to graduate, were recently honored as Student Scholars at Ashby Ponds, an Erickson Senior Living community in Ashburn, VA.

 These dedicated student employees—who worked as servers and hosts across the community’s eight on-campus restaurants—demonstrated outstanding commitment to service and professionalism.

 To recognize their dedication and propel their promising futures, community residents generously donated more than $370,000 to the Student Scholarship Fund— providing students with a $12,000 total scholarship (awarded $1,500 per semester). In addition to the $12,000 scholarship, six students received a named scholarship award of $10,000, bringing their total award amount to $22,000; and four children of Ashby Ponds employees received an additional $5,000 award, bringing their total scholarship amount to $17,000.

 To qualify for a four-year scholarship, a student must work 1,000 hours during a two-year period, maintain good academic and professional standing, and plan to attend a college, university, or trade school on a full-time basis (at least 12 credit hours per semester).

 “Our student employees truly understand the value of these scholarships,” says Executive Director Tom Channon. “We’re incredibly grateful to our residents for their generosity. These awards make a lasting difference in our students’ lives.”

 In addition, the One-Year Scholars Award, a one-year scholarship worth $3,000, was given to 32 college students who tirelessly balance their work schedule at Ashby Ponds and hours of coursework.

 “The Student Scholar and One-Year Scholar awards reflect just a portion of how Ashby Ponds supports team members pursuing their education,” notes Channon. “Our goal is to make Ashby Ponds not only a wonderful place to live but also a rewarding place to grow and work.”
