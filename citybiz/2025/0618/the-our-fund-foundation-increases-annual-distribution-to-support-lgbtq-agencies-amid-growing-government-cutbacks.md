# The Our Fund Foundation Increases Annual Distribution to Support LGBTQ Agencies Amid Growing Government Cutbacks

In response to increasing political attacks on LGBTQ rights and growing funding restrictions targeting LGBTQ-serving agencies, The Our Fund Foundation announced today that it will raise its annual endowed asset distribution from the traditional 5% to 6% for the current fiscal year.

 The decision—amounting to an additional $92,000 in available grant dollars—is intended to provide immediate relief to frontline agencies whose work is being threatened at a time of intensifying need across South Florida’s LGBTQ community.

 “This is a moment that demands leadership, courage, and an abundance mindset,” said David Jobin, President and CEO of The Our Fund Foundation. “While the difference between 5% and 6% may seem marginal on paper, that additional 1% can mean the difference between survival and closure for the agencies we support. These are not just nonprofits—they are lifelines.”

 The Foundation, which stewards nearly $25 million in assets, has built a reputation as one of the nation’s most stable and impactful LGBTQ-specific funders. “This Foundation was built for moments like this,” Jobin added. “Our careful stewardship is a given, but we must be known for not only how carefully we protect our assets – but also how boldly we use them to shape a healthier, safer and more vibrant future for South Florida’s LGBTQ community. This move affirms what we stand for: that philanthropy should not only be safe—it should be brave.”

 This marks only the second time in Our Fund’s 15-year history that the organization has increased its payout rate above the national standard. The first occurred during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic to support agencies responding to urgent community needs.

 Scott Bennett, Chair of the Board of Directors, expressed strong support for the decision: “Our role as a community foundation is to rise to the occasion when others cannot. We’ve seen the writing on the wall—public dollars are drying up for LGBTQ organizations, and that’s unacceptable. We believe in meeting the moment with action.”

 Grants stemming from the increased distribution will be awarded to agencies across the Foundation’s network that are directly impacted by recent funding reductions and political targeting.

 As the only LGBTQ-specific community foundation in the Southeastern United States, The Our Fund Foundation continues to lead the way in advancing equality through philanthropy, strategic investment, and unwavering community support.
