# Q&amp;A with Courtenay Carr Heuer, Co-Founder of Scientific Adventures for Girls: Inspiring the Next Generation of Women in STEM

The U.S. doesn’t have enough STEM talent to maintain its global leadership in science and technology — and it never will if more than half the population is left out before they even reach the workforce. Women, especially those from underrepresented communities, are systematically sidelined from science and technology starting as early as kindergarten. Expanding access to STEM careers for hundreds of millions of people is not just a matter of equity; it’s a prerequisite for long-term economic prosperity. Courtenay Carr Heuer takes that challenge personally.

 As co-founder of Scientific Adventures for Girls (SAfG), Carr Heuer has spent more than a decade building hands-on, out-of-school STEM programs for girls and underserved youth in California’s Bay Area — a region synonymous with innovation. By challenging early gender stereotypes and opening doors where they’ve long been closed, she’s helping to redefine who gets to shape the future of science and technology.

 SAfG just won Nonprofit of the Year in California. What does that recognition mean for your work moving forward?

 It’s an incredible honor and a powerful validation of what we’ve always known — that early intervention works and girls deserve to see themselves in science. Being nominated by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks and named Nonprofit of the Year by the California Association of Nonprofits is a signal to the broader education and policy community that STEM equity must start in elementary school. This recognition helps amplify our voice at a time when equity-focused programming is increasingly under threat.

 It also comes with responsibility. We’re not just being recognized for what we’ve done — we’re being called to scale. We want to reach more communities, support more educators and create sustainable systems that ensure access to hands-on STEM learning in every Title I school. The award affirms that we’re on the right path. Now the challenge is to make sure this kind of impact isn’t the exception, but the norm.

 What types of education policy changes or funding realignments would expand access to early STEM programs in K-6 schools?

 We need to mandate hands-on STEM time and fund direct programming. Federal and state policies should require all elementary schools to provide at least 60 minutes per week of hands-on, project-based STEM learning during the school day. Currently, 40% of California elementary teachers spend 60 minutes or less on science each week, and only one-third feel prepared to teach it.

 Policy changes should include universal STEM curriculum that addresses gender inequities, annual teacher training in STEM instruction and dedicated STEM budgets for every elementary school. Funding agencies like the National Science Foundation should support actual program delivery, not just research.

 Policies should also allow after-school STEM programs to apply directly for government funds, instead of going through large intermediary organizations that often redirect resources away from frontline education providers.

 Where do current state and federal STEM education investments fall short, especially when it comes to supporting elementary-level initiatives over higher education?

 We need to focus on the critical K-6 window when gender stereotypes form and interests take root. Research shows that one-third of girls lose interest in science by fourth grade, so we need to act early to inspire that joy of STEM and discovery

 The elementary programs that do exist during the academic day often miss the mark. Many schools offer “science” classes that rely on worksheets rather than engaging, hands-on experiences that build confidence and STEM identity in young learners.

 The result of this is stark. STEM occupations are projected to grow three times as fast and pay nearly double non-STEM jobs. Yet we’re excluding half our potential talent pool by failing to engage girls early.

 What would an equitable K-12 STEM funding model look like if it truly accounted for disparities in early exposure, school resources and community support?

 The bottom line is that we need to fund where students are, with programming that meets their specific needs. An equitable model includes Title I schools and underserved communities, delivering free programming directly to students at their school sites. SAfG uses this approach — serving more than 875 girls across 25 East Bay schools, where 87% of students qualify for free and reduced lunch.

 The model also requires deliberate diversity in curriculum and staffing. Strong programs feature female STEM role models, especially women of color, and teachers who reflect the student population. When students see professionals who look like them, 63% of middle school girls report feeling more powerful doing STEM activities.

 Funding should also support consistent family engagement, since parental support is critical to long-term persistence in STEM. For SAfG that means weekly communication, family STEM nights, take-home STEM kits and partnerships that bring STEM experiences beyond the classroom.

 We must also address the teacher pipeline. That includes loan forgiveness for STEM majors who commit to teaching at the elementary level and partnerships with retired STEM professionals who can lead or support instruction.

 If you could add one sentence to an education funding bill today to support girls in STEM, what would it be, and why?

 “Mandate that all elementary schools should provide 60 minutes of hands-on STEM each week starting in kindergarten, much like some schools are now adding computer science classes as part of the curriculum starting in kindergarten. And ensure the programming is designed to reach all girls and boys.

 Beyond public policy, what can private-sector funders, companies or engaged citizens do to help close the early STEM equity gap?

 The current political climate has created real challenges for DEI initiatives and equity-focused STEM programming. As federal and state support becomes less reliable, the private sector and the community can help fill resource gaps.

 We’re grateful to all of our partners who have shown their support through financial investments and hands-on engagement. They’ve created a blueprint that others who want to get involved can mirror, including multi-year funding commitments, volunteering in classrooms and at events, and developing real-world lesson plans tied to their industries.

 We are excited to see some of the first SAfG graduates entering college as the new face of STEM.
