# Avery Point’s Predictable Costs Provide Freedom, Value, And Peace of Mind

When Betty and Jim Mason started researching their senior living options in the Richmond, Va., area, they were looking for a community with a worry-free lifestyle and predictable costs.

 “With our former house–in a 55-plus community–we had to make sure our sidewalks were shoveled when it snowed, and if anything broke inside, we were responsible for it,” says Betty.

 With maintenance-free residences and a predictable monthly service package, Avery Point, an Erickson Senior Living community in Short Pump, Va., was exactly what the couple was looking for.

 “Some of the other places around were not what we thought they would be, financially,” notes Betty. “We figured out what it cost to live in the house we were in and what it would cost to live at Avery Point. We felt comfortable about moving!”

 Now, the Masons are enjoying their new home as well as an entire community filled with amenities, activities, and clubs–just a short stroll from their front door.

 Predictable costs

 “We just felt really good about Erickson,” says Betty, pointing to the attractive pricing structure that Erickson Senior Living offers to retirees across the country.

 With Erickson’s fee-for-service model, residents only pay for the services they currently want, as opposed to the life care model that requires payment up front for services residents may never need.

 In addition to this model, Betty and Jim appreciate Avery Point’s monthly service package, which bundles the costs of utilities, maintenance, dining at on-site restaurants, access to amenities, and regularly scheduled transportation into one predictable bill.

 “I don’t have to cook every night–or even come up with meal ideas!” says Betty.

 One day, while Betty was out running errands, Jim found a leak under one of their bathroom sinks. He simply called the community’s General Services department to report it.

 “They were up here so fast! By the time I got home, it was all fixed,” recalls Betty. “They even checked the other bathroom to make sure it was fine. The people who work here are so nice, and they do a good job.”

 And if an appliance was to break and couldn’t be fixed, General Services will replace it with a new one–at no extra cost. By eliminating the possibility of unforeseen expenses, residents like Betty and Jim are able to manage their budget with confidence.

 So much to gain

 Without the responsibility of maintenance and juggling bills, the Masons have more time to pursue their interests and make new friends.

 Betty often spends her mornings in the fitness center, participating in a range of exercise classes. She enjoys cardio strength, line dancing, Zumba, and is even trying yoga.

 She and Jim play canasta together with a group of friends twice a month. On cloudy days, they like catching Tuesday afternoon movie screenings on campus.

 “I stay so busy,” says Betty. “It’s just wonderful!”

 A dynamic future

 Avery Point is becoming known for providing great value and a vibrant lifestyle for residents.

 “By continuously evaluating and investing in our services and amenities, we ensure a dynamic, engaging future for all of our residents,” says Luke McKinley, Avery Point’s financial director. This forward-thinking approach not only enhances residents’ quality of life but also ensures the vitality of the entire community.

 The new Life Enrichment Center will host community performances on its large stage, and the fitness areas will be perfect for indoor pickleball games and exercise classes. With the opening of Preston Woods this summer, residents will have an additional bar and two new restaurants to enjoy.

 “We want to give residents the opportunity to live their best lives,” says McKinley.

 Peace of mind

 Betty and Jim are so glad they made the move to their two-bedroom, two-bath residence at Avery Point and embraced a worry-free lifestyle.

 But most of all, they appreciate the peace of mind that comes from their 80% refundable entrance fee.* The fee, collected as part of the residency process, will go back to them or their beneficiaries, if or when they leave the community.

 “Our children never have to worry about us anymore because everything we need is in the community,” says Betty. “Our move took the pressure off of all of us.”

 Invest in your future self at Avery Point. From top-notch amenities to affordable, maintenance-free residences, you are sure to live your retirement to the fullest. Request more information today!

 *As per the Residence and Care Agreement.
