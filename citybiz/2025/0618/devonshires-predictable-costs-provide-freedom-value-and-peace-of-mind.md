# Devonshire’s Predictable Costs Provide Freedom, Value, And Peace of Mind

When Sue and Paul Brands were exploring their senior living options, Devonshire, the Erickson Senior Living community at PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., stood out for many reasons.

 “Devonshire offers a vast array of opportunities and benefits above and beyond similar communities we considered,” explains Sue.

 The community’s stellar reputation and welcoming atmosphere were significant draws for the couple, but what motivated them to make the move was Devonshire’s predictable costs and unbeatable value–especially after incurring some maintenance costs with their former house in nearby North Palm Beach.

 “The most appealing financial benefit was the fact that we would not be incurring monthly costs above our current costs, especially when you factor in annual increases for homeowners insurance and real estate taxes–two things we don’t worry about anymore,” says Sue.

 Since moving last June, the Brands have been managing their budget with confidence and making the most of their retirement years!

 Predictable costs

 The Brands were attracted to the monthly service package, which bundles the costs of utilities, including cable television; maintenance, including appliance repair and replacement; access to community amenities; weekly housekeeping; a meal plan at on-site restaurants; and valet services into one predictable bill.

 More than 90% of seniors want predictable monthly expenses to cover most of their daily activities, meals, and housing, according to a recent survey commissioned by Erickson Senior Living via Edge Research, which is exactly what the package offers.

 “The all-inclusive monthly service package works well for us,” says Sue. “We no longer face the burden of responsibilities regarding home repairs or storm damage.”

 Like all Erickson Senior Living communities, Devonshire is home to an array of state-of-the-art amenities. But Devonshire community members have an additional, unique perk, as their monthly service package also includes membership at the world-renowned PGA National, which boasts five golf courses, nineteen competition-level tennis courts, and six pickleball courts.

 “Without having to stress over finances, our community members have more time to explore the amenities, activities, and services that interest them,” says Executive Director Brad Andrus.

 Value that lasts

 He adds, “What’s more, by continuously evaluating and investing in our services and amenities, we ensure a dynamic, engaging future for all of our community members.” This forward-thinking approach not only enhances residents’ quality of life but also ensures the vitality of the entire community.

 Recently, the community underwent a complete revitalization of the clubhouse, reflecting a modern, Mediterranean design complete with new wallpaper, lighting, paint, art, and furniture. The three residence buildings on campus were also updated with new lighting and furniture.

 Sue and Paul, loving the community’s new look, are always out and about, taking advantage of everything that is available to them. They regularly visit the fitness center for flexibility and strength-training classes and attend an array of on-site lectures.

 “There is a variety of activities which we are able to join anytime, including book clubs, musical and artistic groups, and all sorts of games from cards to mah-jongg,” says Sue. “We also enjoy swimming and pickleball. Several nights a week, there is live entertainment in the lounge. One of our favorite activities is walking along the double-wide sidewalk from Devonshire to the PGA resort.”

 Peace of mind

 But most of all, the couple appreciates the peace of mind that comes from knowing they have a Home for Life.*
