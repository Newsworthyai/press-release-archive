# Ashby Ponds’ Predictable Costs Provide Freedom, Value, And Peace of Mind

Frank Doe and Donna Shelton were already familiar with Erickson Senior Living when they began exploring their senior living options.

 “Years ago, I helped my father move to Greenspring,” says Frank of the Erickson Senior Living community in Springfield, Va. “We learned about the lifestyle and the financial benefits of moving to the community, like the 90% refundable entrance fee* and the monthly service package.”

 He adds, “So, when it came time to consider our own move, we looked at the three Erickson Senior Living communities in Northern Virginia. For us, Ashby Ponds was the winner.”

 Moving to Ashby Ponds, the Erickson Senior Living community in Ashburn, Va., has proven to be a wise financial decision for the couple, as they were incurring increasing maintenance costs for their old house in Vienna, Va.

 Now, like all Ashby Ponds residents, Frank and Donna are able to manage their budget with confidence, knowing that maintenance is included in their monthly service package and their future is safe and secure.

 Promise of predictability

 In addition to maintenance, Ashby Ponds’ monthly service package bundles the costs of utilities, a meal plan at on-site restaurants, repair and replacement of appliances, access to amenities, and regularly scheduled transportation into one predictable bill.

 The package supports the more than 90% of seniors who say they want predictable monthly expenses to cover most of their daily activities, meals, and housing–according to a recent survey commissioned by Erickson Senior Living via Edge Research.

 Frank, who serves on the Resident Advisory Council’s finance subcommittee, notes that some other costs associated with homeownership are eliminated.

 “For me, that’s the most appealing financial benefit of moving to Ashby Ponds–the bills you no longer have to pay,” says Frank. “Homeowner’s insurance and property taxes go away. The need for a security system goes away. We spend less money eating out at restaurants, thanks to Ashby Ponds’ nine on-campus restaurants. And the shuttle service eliminates the need for a vehicle.”

 Unbeatable value

 Many residents also appreciate the industry-leading 90% refundable entrance fee–the heart of the community’s pricing structure. The entrance fee, collected as part of the residency process, will go back to you or your beneficiaries, if or when you leave the community.

 And because the entrance fee is unique to each residence’s features, living at the sought-after community is more accessible than many people realize.

 “Ashby Ponds boasts a range of one- and two-bedroom residences, which means we are able to accommodate many budgets,” says Sales Director Elizabeth Freeman (formerly Dunwoody). “People are often surprised by how much value they get for their money.”

 She continues, “What’s more, by continuously evaluating and investing in our services and amenities, we ensure a dynamic, engaging future for all of our residents.”

 This forward-thinking approach not only enhances residents’ quality of life but also ensures the vitality of the entire community. In the last year, Ashby Ponds opened Leesburg Landing, the community’s final residence building; opened Orchard Terrace, an expansion of the on-campus continuing care neighborhood; and added Black Rock Bistro, the community’s ninth restaurant.

 So much to gain

 Without the responsibility of maintenance and juggling bills, residents have more time to pursue their hobbies and interests through the community’s amenities and 200-plus clubs.

 Frank and Donna fill their calendar with regular visits to the fitness center and pool, bocce games, bike rides along local trails, and kayaking with Ashby Ponds’ paddling club.

 In addition, Donna is active with campus political groups, plays bridge with friends, and volunteers as “house captain” for their neighbors in the Harpers Mill residence building. Frank recently started a new book club focused on adventures.

 “We also enjoy the numerous cultural opportunities brought to campus, including the Loudoun Symphonic Winds, rock and roll bands, and performances from the George Mason University School of Music,” says Donna. “We like trying new experiences, too, like the upcoming drumming circle.”

 Peace of mind

 Most of all, the couple relishes the peace of mind that comes with knowing they have a Home for Life.*

 No one ever expects to run out of money, but sometimes unforeseen issues arise that can quickly deplete your hard-earned savings and put you at risk. At Ashby Ponds, we’ve planned for life’s uncertainties and are prepared to assist eligible residents who outlive their resources. No one will be asked to leave the community because of a genuine inability to pay.

 “Knowing that safety net is in place benefits all of us,” says Frank. “It’s just one of the many reasons why we enjoy our lives at Ashby Ponds.”
