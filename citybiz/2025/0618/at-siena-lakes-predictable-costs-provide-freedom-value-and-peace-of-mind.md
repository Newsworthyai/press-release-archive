# At Siena Lakes, Predictable Costs Provide Freedom, Value, and Peace of Mind

For Jack and Judy Heiderscheit, moving to Siena Lakes, the Erickson Senior Living community in Naples, Fla., has proved to be a wise financial decision.

 “We’ve had no surprises, relative to additional costs, and that includes everything you can imagine,” says Jack. “We like that aspect of living here. We also find that the monthly service package is predictable, and it includes so much. We really think it provides good financial value.”

 As a result, Jack and Judy no longer have to be concerned with everyday economic fluctuations. Instead, they can balance their budgets with confidence, knowing their future is secure.

 Peace of mind

 Along with the benefits of the predictable monthly service package, residents at Siena Lakes can choose an 80% refundable entrance fee* or a nonrefundable entrance fee. The entrance fee, collected as part of the residency process, will go back to you or your beneficiaries, if or when you leave the community.

 “The monthly service package tells residents exactly what they will pay for the next 12 months, so that they can set their budget and forget about it,” explains says Andrew Ferraiuolo, Siena Lakes’ financial director. “Even if their electricity usage increases, for example, their monthly cost remains the same, and no unplanned expenses at the community are passed onto the residents.”

 And with Siena Lakes’ fee-for-service model, residents only pay for services they use, as opposed to the life care model that requires payment for services they may never need.

 Just one check each month covers nearly all of a resident’s daily needs. The service package includes heating and air-conditioning; all utilities, including phone; a dining plan to use at on-site restaurants; maintenance, including repair and replacement of appliances; fitness center and swimming pool; basic cable TV; trash collection and recycling; scheduled shuttle service; 24-hour security and emergency response; professional landscaping; 24-hour reception; biweekly light housekeeping and linen service; under-building parking/garage parking; and much more.

 Jack appreciates how reasonable and comprehensive the monthly service packages make their finances. “Our costs are very controllable,” especially when you consider dining in the restaurants, he adds.

 A welcome change

 This benefit is a welcome change from their old house, Jack notes. Despite belonging to the homeowners’ association, he recalls that they often incurred additional expenses, including maintaining their pool, tiling their roof, and taking care of all indoor repairs.

 In addition, he notes, “Each year, the homeowners’ association changed their fees, and we were responsible for those variable costs.”

 However, since moving to Siena Lakes two years ago, the couple no longer worries about unforeseen expenses and repairs. When their dryer vent came apart, they simply called the General Services team that quickly came and made the repair.

 “They were Johnny-on-the-spot! Anything we’ve called for has been fixed within a few hours or at least that same day,” says Judy. “It’s wonderful. And twice a year, General Services changes the filters in the air conditioning system and in the refrigerator. Those were all services we paid for before. Now it’s all included.”

 Ongoing enhancements

 Along with a wide range of homes to suit every budget and style, residents have access to an entire community filled with amenities, activities, services, and opportunities for social connections.

 “In the three short years since Siena Lakes opened, we have installed a golf simulator, upgraded the Dog Park, and renovated the bocce ball court. And there’s more to come,” says Ferraiuolo.

 This year, the community is upgrading wireless connections throughout campus and completing an additional Stretch and Tone room.

 Providing a vibrant lifestyle, financial stability, and access to resources promoting health and well-being not only enhances the quality of life for residents but also ensures the vitality of the entire community well into the future.

 World of opportunities

 Judy serves on the Resident Advisory Council’s Building and Grounds subcommittee, takes aerobics classes in the fitness center, and regularly plays the card game Hand and Foot with friends on campus.

 Jack enjoys playing poker and golfing with his Siena Lakes neighbors at the nearby Quail Village Golf Club.

 Together, the couple plays on the community’s bocce ball team, attends frequent music nights, and enjoys daily morning walks on campus.

 “Our kids say we’re the poster children for Siena Lakes. It’s really been a great move for us,” says Judy.
