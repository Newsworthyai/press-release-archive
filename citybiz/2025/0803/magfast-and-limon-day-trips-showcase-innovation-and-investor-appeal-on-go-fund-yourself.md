# Magfast and Limon Day Trips Showcase Innovation and Investor Appeal on Go Fund Yourself

On July 31st at 7PM ET, Go Fund Yourself returned to Cheddar TV for its 10th episode—spotlighting two standout startups that exemplify what today’s investors are looking for: innovation, traction, and scalable market opportunity.

 The episode featured MAGFAST, a fast-growing technology company disrupting the $20+ billion charging industry, and Limon Day Trips, a travel-tech platform redefining how explorers engage with destinations using audio-based storytelling. Both companies presented compelling investment cases while leveraging the national visibility and titan mentorship that has made Go Fund Yourself a must-watch for investors and entrepreneurs alike.

 Magfast: Redefining the Future of Charging

 First to pitch was Seymour Segnit, the founder and CEO of MAGFAST, a magnetic, snap-to-connect charging system designed to “change charging for good.” With a product line that includes wireless power banks, USB-C cables, and Gen2 ultra-fast chargers that power up in under 25 minutes, Magfast blends functionality with elegant design for today’s device-dependent consumer.

 But MAGAST’s innovation doesn’t stop at the product level—it’s a company with serious financial traction. The brand has already raised more than $21 million in preorders and has sold out multiple offerings on Netcapital, totaling over $10 million in early-stage capital. It’s a rare combination of product-market fit, loyal customer base, and sophisticated go-to-market execution.

 “This is a smart, scalable hardware solution with proven demand,” said one of the show’s titans during the segment. “It’s not just about cables—it’s about simplifying the way we power our lives.”

 Segnit’s charismatic pitch and data-backed growth strategy resonated with the panel of Go Fund Yourself titans, including Rory Cutaia, Jayson Waller, and David Meltzer—each of whom brings decades of expertise in scaling high-growth ventures.

 Limon Day Trips: The Voice of Next-Gen Travel

 

 Following Magfast was a pitch from Lili and Ray Montes, sibling co-founders of Limon Day Trips, a soon-to-launch platform that allows users to discover, share, and curate unique travel experiences through immersive, voice-recorded stories.

 Limon is designed for the modern traveler—someone seeking more than Google Maps and TripAdvisor. With a user-generated audio layer that highlights off-the-beaten-path day trips, local stories, and authentic voices, Limon is creating an entirely new travel category: audio-first exploration.

 The inspiration for Limon came from Lili’s college radio show and Ray’s passion for local travel. Together, they’ve built a tech platform that combines curated storytelling, community features, and monetization potential through creator tools and partnerships. Their vision? To turn Limon into the go-to destination for experiential travel content.

 “The travel space is overdue for a meaningful upgrade,” noted one of the titans. “This model taps into two things people crave—authentic experiences and human connection.”

 With Gen Z and millennial travelers increasingly favoring experiential discovery over commercial tours, Limon’s timing could prove ideal for market entry and scale.

 A Platform for Growth and Access

 Now in its tenth episode, Go Fund Yourself has proven itself as more than just a pitch show. It’s a springboard for startups looking to scale, raise capital, and gain mentorship from industry titans. With national visibility on Cheddar TV, participating companies receive a level of exposure that can open doors to investors, partnerships, and press coverage almost instantly.

 For founders, Go Fund Yourself provides the kind of access typically reserved for later-stage ventures—yet it focuses on companies that are just beginning to break out.
