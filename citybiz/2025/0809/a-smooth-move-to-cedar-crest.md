# A Smooth Move to Cedar Crest

By Susan Ingram

 Ruth Ann Carroll was living at a 55-plus community when Cedar Crest, an Erickson Senior Living community in Pompton Plains, N.J., caught her eye.

 After going on a tour of the community, she decided to join the Priority List, which saved her spot in line for her preferred one-bedroom, one-bath residence with a patio.

 Her membership afforded her a wealth of other perks as well, but the personalized planning and moving support she received was especially impactful.

 Ruth Ann worked with many of Cedar Crest’s recommended partners–including a real estate agent, a senior move manager, and a moving company–to streamline her move, so she could start enjoying her new vibrant lifestyle from day one.

 “Each of these services was an A+,” Ruth Ann says. “For me especially, the senior move manager and organizers helped me beyond measure!”

 Creating a plan

 To make the moving process even easier for incoming Cedar Crest residents, Brandon Postlewaite, the community’s planning and moving consultant, coordinates all the services they wish to use and offers complimentary home visits.

 “During a home visit, we’ll typically discuss their ideal timeline and any services they’re interested in, and I’ll take some time to answer questions they have,” he explains. “Based on their goals, I’ll recommend a preferred real estate agent, downsizing and decluttering services, or a moving company–whatever best fits their needs.”

 He continues, “It all adds up to peace of mind. Priority List members appreciate that someone will be able to sell their home in a timely manner and get them the best possible deal. And our senior move managers help sell or donate unwanted items, which takes a lot of stress off their shoulders.”

 Postlewaite also uses home visits as an opportunity to help Priority List members begin to envision their new living space.

 “After measuring the furniture and items they’d like to bring to their new home, I can help figure out a layout so everything fits,” he says. “Usually, after my visit, I see relief in their eyes. They feel comfort knowing their belongings are going to fit and that there is a plan in action!”

 Personalize your space

 After meeting with Postlewaite to discuss her timeline, Ruth Ann decided that she wanted to customize her home before moving in.

 Cedar Crest’s Custom Interiors team helps incoming residents create their dream residence with a range of upgrades, including custom decor, paint, flooring, storage, and other options.

 “I was very happy with the Custom Interiors team,” Ruth Ann says. “I consulted with them to install overhead lighting and custom cabinets in my bathroom.”

 A seamless move

 Eager to make a seamless move to her personalized, maintenance-free residence, Ruth Ann then worked with a local real estate agent who boasted years of experience in the area; a senior move manager who helped her declutter, pack, and unpack; and a moving company to transport her belongings with care.

 “The senior move manager I worked with knew all the players at Cedar Crest and organized the move. The money I spent was so worth it!” Ruth Ann says. “From the organizing and packing up at my condo to coming to Cedar Crest and unpacking and organizing my closets and chest of drawers, everyone ensured my absolutely seamless move into my new home.”

 She adds, “When I walked into my new apartment, I was ready to sit and enjoy the space.”

 Full steam ahead

 From day one, Ruth Ann has been living life to the fullest–thanks to her smooth move.

 As a bridge player, she appreciates the many on-campus groups that cater to various skill levels. At the fitness center, she participates in Stretch and Tone classes a couple times a week and takes advantage of the NuStep machines.

 “I also enjoy having so many dining options, from eating in one of the three formal restaurants to the more relaxed pubs. I eat dinner twice a week with my bridge partners,” Ruth Ann says. “I’m so happy to have made the decision to move to Cedar Crest!”
