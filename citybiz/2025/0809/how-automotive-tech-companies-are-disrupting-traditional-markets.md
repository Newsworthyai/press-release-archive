# How Automotive Tech Companies Are Disrupting Traditional Markets

There is no secret left that cars are going through a significant change. It took years before there were many changes in shape and functionality of cars.

 However, the new and more technology oriented businesses are entering the fray and they are doing it very differently, even car dealer such as https://dyler.com/ confirm it. It is not only the introduction of new types of car that are being made but how these cars are designed, sold, serviced and driven.

 Old car makers are shaking up because of these changes. Most of them are attempting to adapt but then keeping up with new methods of doing things is not easy.

 The Change is being driven by Electric Cars

 One of the largest causes of such an upheaval is the availability of electric cars. Firms such as Tesla demonstrated to the world that a car company does not have to be thousands of years old to become a success. All it has to do is to develop a good product, with the appropriate technology as well as support.

 Now the same is being done by other brands such as Rivian, NIO and Lucid. They have no dealerships or mediators. Rather they sell directly to the buyers online, and in most cases, he /she delivers the cars to the doors of the buyers.

 Such companies construct their cars in a different way, as well. They install newer components, engineer more intelligent systems, and they even upgrade their cars on the Internet. The ability to do that never existed at most of the old car companies.

 Auto-Mobile mobiles Have Become Smart Machines

 The car car nowadays does not possess a solely unique power supply which is the engine but the software too. Automatic park, voice input and driving help are the feature of many new vehicles. Other people can go ahead and correct bugs or even add new tools on the online updates.

 This would imply that you would not drive your car to be parked in the garages whenever some small repairs are required and thus needs to be done.

 The answer could be in terms of a fix in case of an issue. Tesla uses this kind of technology yet it is the same thing too now with other manufacturers. Volvo, BYD, not to mention such brands as Mercedes and Ford, are installing in their vehicles an even higher degree of smart technology.

 Self Driving Is On The Horizon

 Tesla is not perfecting Full Self-Driving. This will not only pose a problem to the car companies. There is quite a possibility that the occupation of delivery workers, taxi drivers, and truck drivers are either going to change or be killed off.

 And there is the legal matter as well. and who shall be to blame In case of crash? The man on the bike, the makers of the gears or the programmers of computers? Some of the new issues have been identified as follows, these were not the case in the early time of driving.

 The Car Repair Process Is More Digital

 Gas-powered cars have more breakdowns. They have a higher number of moving parts and thus there are more exposures to breakage. Electric cars are not afflicted by the same issue.

 And, now much repairs are possible, even without visiting the garage, and with the smart systems and remote over-the-air updates, too. That is changing the appearance of repair places. Mechanics are now to know how to work on tools and technology.

 This will deprive the previous repair shops of business as new shops with specialization in the software and electrical intensive cars will emerge.

 Older brands are competing to keep up Older brands are making an effort to catch up with

 The car giants are aware that they have to do things differently.

 The majority of them are trying to be more of tech startups. Mercedes is even designing their car software. Toyota is making trials of solid-state battery. Ford has entered into partnership with Google on new things.

 At the same time, technology companies find that cars are not that simple to create. It is not just the pursuit of the development of fast, but the handling of safety rules, recalls and the spread of the suppliers across the world.

 The entry of new businesses and competition with existing businesses is leading to the whole industry to speed up and become smarter.

 Final Thoughts

 The car is not the only thing that is transformed due to the new technology car companies. They are changing our way of thinking when it comes to the journey A to B. The conventional brands can no longer keep up and they have new strong rivals.

 And what is the most exciting of them all? This is just the beginning. You should be prepared to keep doing things at speed as far as cars are concerned: Driving, riding, renting, sharing, even.
