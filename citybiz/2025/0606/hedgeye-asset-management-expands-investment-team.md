# Hedgeye Asset Management Expands Investment Team

Hedgeye Asset Management, LLC, a subsidiary of Hedgeye Risk Management, LLC, today announced the expansion of its investment management team with the addition of Portfolio Managers David Salem and Sam Rahman.

 Both will report to HAM Chief Investment Officer John McNamara and are expected to begin managing assets in the second quarter of 2025.

 David Salem previously served as President and Chief Investment Officer of The Investment Fund for Foundations (TIFF), where he oversaw more than $8 billion on behalf of 800+ endowed charities. Salem was also a partner at GMO, working closely with founder Jeremy Grantham to design and manage commingled funds for many of the largest U.S. foundations.

 

Sam Rahman joins HAM after a 15-year tenure at Crosby Advisors, the Fidelity family office. There, he managed a multi-billion-dollar strategy focused on long-term capital appreciation, working directly for Fidelity Investments Founder and Chairman Ned Johnson.

 “David and Sam bring exceptional institutional experience that aligns perfectly with Hedgeye CEO Keith McCullough’s vision of democratizing access to world-class investment research,” said McNamara. “Their expertise will soon be available to all investors through HAM’s ETF offerings.”
