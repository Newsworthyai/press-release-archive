# Drive Health Appoints James Stringham As Chief Strategy Officer

PHOENIX–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Drive Health, a Phoenix-based digital health startup, today announces the appointment of James Stringham as Chief Strategy Officer (CSO). Stringham brings unmatched experience in public sector healthcare, having most recently led organizations like Banner Government Health Plans and Magellan Healthcare through complex, large-scale public sector contracts including AHCCCS Complete Care (ACC) in Arizona and other Medicaid and Medicare initiatives nationwide.

 With 30 years of experience in healthcare, Stringham is a recognized thought leader, influencing industry dialogue through policy recommendations, advocacy initiatives and engagements at both state and national levels. As CSO, he will oversee the implementation of strategic industry initiatives, foster key partnerships, and collaborate with C-suite officers to identify opportunities for business growth.

 “Having worked closely with Jim over the past year, we’ve seen firsthand his deep understanding of public health and his genuine excitement for our mission at Drive Health,” says Drive Health CEO Kevin Longoria. “We’re thrilled to officially welcome him aboard as we strengthen our partnerships and expand our impact across Medicare and Medicaid programs.”

 Stringham previously served as the Vice President and CEO of Banner Government Health Plans, overseeing the organization’s expansion across central and southern Arizona. Under his leadership, the company served over 300,000 members across various programs, including ACC, Arizona Long Term Care System, Dual Eligible Special Needs Plan, and Banner’s Medicare Advantage plans.

 Before Banner, he served as the National Senior Vice President at Magellan Healthcare. Stringham has also served as a board member of the Association for Community Affiliated Plans, a national organization dedicated to equitably improving the health and well-being of people with limited resources or significant health needs.

 Stringham says, “I’ve had the privilege of supporting patients facing chronic conditions – witnessing their resilience while navigating barriers to care and health literacy. These challenges too often stand between individuals and the quality care they deserve. That’s why I’m thrilled to join Drive Health, an organization dedicated to bridging these gaps and ensuring equitable healthcare for all. Together, we will bring meaningful change to the communities that need it most.”
