# Dallas Trial Attorney Alex Brauer Earns Prestigious Chambers USA Honors

DALLAS–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Alex Brauer, co-founder of the litigation boutique Bailey Brauer PLLC, has again earned recognition from Chambers USA for his handling of high-stakes commercial disputes.

 This is the seventh consecutive year Mr. Brauer has been honored for his commercial litigation practice.

 Published by London-based Chambers and Partners, the annual Chambers USA guide is regarded as the nation’s most respected legal directory based on its comprehensive analysis of attorneys and law firms. Recognition is based on extensive attorney and client interviews designed to identify those who possess outstanding legal acumen and other qualities valued most by clients, including diligence and commitment to professional conduct and client service.

 Clients depend on Mr. Brauer’s ability to develop creative resolutions to their most complex disputes and to present compelling cases to judges and juries in state and federal courts when acceptable resolutions cannot be reached. During the research outreach, one client told Chambers that Mr. Brauer “is our go-to lawyer. We are very pleased with his breadth of knowledge and service.” Another client noted that “Alex is great to work with and very responsive to our needs and questions.”

 

Business clients regularly call upon Mr. Brauer to help resolve disputes involving allegations of fraud, deceptive practices in commercial transactions, and breaches of fiduciary duties and non-compete agreements. He also represents clients in disputes involving the sales and purchases of businesses.

 His work has consistently earned professional accolades from The Best Lawyers in America, Texas Super Lawyers, Lawdragon 500, D Magazine, BTI Consulting and Texas Lawyer. He is also a Litigation Counsel of America Fellow.

 Earlier this year, Bailey Brauer PLLC was selected to the companion Chambers Texas Spotlight 2025 Guide, which recognizes outstanding boutique and midsized firms that best deliver partner-level attention, deep regional knowledge and cost-effective solutions for sophisticated legal work.
