# Q&amp;A with Wayne Fromm, Entrepreneur and Inventor Behind the New Snoopy Magic Mixer

Wayne Fromm is a prolific Canadian inventor and entrepreneur, best known as the inventor of the original selfie stick — a product that revolutionized how people capture and share their experiences worldwide. Throughout his career, Fromm has developed a wide range of consumer products that combine creativity, innovation, and practicality, including Disney’s Magic Talking Mirror and the globally successful Quik Pod. His work often blends nostalgia with functionality, appealing to both children and adults across generations.

 Fromm’s latest creation, the Snoopy Magic Mixer, celebrates the beloved Peanuts character’s 75th anniversary while empowering kids to safely explore food preparation. Known for his hands-on approach to invention and licensing, Fromm continues to push the boundaries of product design with a focus on safety, simplicity, and enduring fun.

 What inspired you—personally and creatively—to design the Snoopy Magic Mixer as a tribute to Snoopy’s 75th anniversary?

 When I was in 7th grade, my homeroom teacher was a huge Peanuts fan. As a surprise, I created a 4’ x 8’ drawing on plywood of Charlie Brown and Snoopy, with the edges woodburned for effect. That project sparked my lifelong love for the Peanuts gang. Sharp blades have always made me uneasy, and I wanted to create a safe appliance for children — something that would empower them to experiment with food, learn about ingredients, and express their creativity.

 The Magic Mixer is a hands‑free device with a swirl disk and no blades or buttons. Can you walk us through the engineering and safety considerations behind that design?

 I spent the better part of a year experimenting before I finally perfected the mechanics. Engineers told me again and again there was no way this could be safe for children under the age of 8 — they said not to even try. I tried anyway. And I succeeded. It passes laboratory safety testing for children as young as 3, meeting the ASTM F963 standard.

What elements do you think make the Magic Mixer resonate across generations?

 Parents, grandparents, even great-grandparents — they all know Snoopy. Even if a child isn’t familiar with him, Snoopy’s simply adorable. The Snoopy Sno-Cone Machine has been on the market for more than four decades, so there’s already an association between Snoopy and fun, edible treats.

 The product aims to encourage healthy habits in kids and busy adults. How did you test its effectiveness for mixing things like powdered vitamins, smoothies, or salad dressings?

 The motor spins at 15,000 RPM and will only activate when placed properly in the lid. It creates a strong vortex. As long as you add ingredients in the right order — specifically liquids first, then powders — it works beautifully. I’ve included two spinning rods: one plastic, shaped like a propeller, and the other designed like a milk frother. Experimenting with one or both will help you achieve the desired results.

 BPA-free materials and mess-free operation are key highlights. What challenges did you face in sourcing safe, durable materials at scale?

 The lid locks securely to prevent splashing, and the mixer won’t operate unless it’s properly in place. A stopper fits into the hole in the lid to prevent spills, even after mixing — especially when the reusable silicone straw is inserted. At the base of the cup, there’s a friction pad that serves two purposes: it dampens sound and prevents the cup from moving while the motor runs. The final product is whisper-quiet.

 In terms of intellectual property, did acquiring a Snoopy license present unique challenges compared to your other inventions?

 Some people use agencies to facilitate licensing. I prefer to deal directly.

 You mentioned a lifelong love of Snoopy. Can you share a personal childhood memory that influenced this project?

 As a child growing up in Toronto, I saw a production of You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown. If I’m not mistaken, a young Martin Short was in it. After that, I was hooked!

 What’s your favorite beverage or recipe to blend with the mixer—and have you tested it in front of Snoopy fans or social content creators?

 My favorite is orange juice, vanilla extract, frozen yogurt, and pureed mango — the kind found in those pouches in grocery aisles for young children. I call it an Orange Wayneous! This is the first time I’m sharing it. Everyone’s welcome to give it a try.

 As an inventor and entrepreneur, you’ve seen trends evolve. How do you balance innovative design with consumer convenience in today’s fast-moving market?

 My products need to be exceptional, useful, fun, novel — and built to last for years. I still receive messages from people saying their Magic Mirrors from 1991 work perfectly. Some people are still using their original Quik Pod selfie sticks from 2006. I strive to create products that will last for generations. I have a tripod that belonged to my father — that’s my inspiration.

 Looking ahead, are there more character-themed or nostalgic products in the works—perhaps building on lessons learned from the Magic Mixer’s development?

 I’m working on a STEAM version that will teach food science and inspire future food scientists!
