# Q&amp;A with Tim Lovett, CEO and Co-Owner of Waterloo Turf

Tim Lovett, CEO and Co-Owner of Waterloo Turf, brings experience from a broad variety of sectors from technology to real estate, giving him an eye for macro trends and franchise growth opportunities. Tim earned his economics degree from Wheaton College (IL) where he also competed as an NCAA Football player.

 Founded in 2021 and franchised since December 2024, Waterloo Turf offers a unique opportunity for franchisees to enter the growing turf industry with a low upfront investment and minimal overhead. Waterloo Turf offers services for both residential and commercial-based projects, delivering high-quality turf solutions for a wide range of properties including luxury homes, commercially owned areas, dog parks, daycares, schools and more. Waterloo Turf promotes the ideal lifestyle of “Getting your Saturdays Back,” allowing families and friends to focus on spending quality time together in their outdoor space.

 How has your franchise footprint grown since launching the opportunity in 2024, and what lessons stand out?

 Since launching in 2024, we’ve expanded beyond Texas into several other states, with over 36 territories sold. The biggest lesson so far? When you build the right system and invest in hands-on support, growth doesn’t have to come at the expense of quality. The demand is there, and people are looking for something that feels modern, profitable, and backed by a strong infrastructure.

 Which geographic regions or market segments are the highest priority for your next wave of expansion?

 We’re targeting regions where outdoor living isn’t just seasonal, it’s part of the everyday lifestyle. Areas like the Southeast, Southwest, and select Midwest markets where homeowners invest in their spaces year-round. These are places where turf isn’t just a cosmetic upgrade, it’s a lifestyle improvement, and demand continues to grow.

 How do you balance rapid growth with maintaining the personal touch that defines Waterloo Turf?

 We’ve built Waterloo Turf to scale without losing what makes us special. That’s why we have an in-house team across every department: marketing, turf pros, sales, and training, so our franchisees aren’t chasing down help or dealing with disconnected vendors. It’s also why our slogan, Get Your Saturdays Back, rings true for both our customers and our owners. We’ve created a business that still feels personal, even as it grows, because everything we do is built around strengthening our internal and external relationships and providing quality results.

 What shifts in homeowner and commercial buyer preferences have driven the surge in artificial turf demand?

 People are tired of spending their weekends on yard work, especially when water costs are up and the weather is unpredictable. Homeowners want low-maintenance outdoor spaces that still look good year-round. On the commercial side, it’s about durability and cost savings: HOAs, schools, and businesses want clean, functional landscapes without the ongoing upkeep. Everyone’s prioritizing efficiency, and turf delivers on that.

 How does Waterloo Turf differentiate its service offerings in a saturated industry?

 At Waterloo Turf, we treat installs like a system. We use tools like accurate site measurement software, transparent quoting, and trained turf pros to ensure every job is clean, fast, and done right the first time. Plus, we integrate turf with other outdoor upgrades like pavers, gravel, and flower beds to fully transform the way people use and experience their outdoor space.

 In which industries (e.g., sports fields, landscaping, pet facilities) do you see the fastest turf adoption?

 Residential is leading the way, especially with families who want more usable yard space. We’re also seeing growth in pet facilities and schools, where turf solves real challenges around cleanliness and consistent usability.

 What (if any) trends have you seen in recent turf projects—any design trends, stylistic patterns, etc.?

 Homeowners are going beyond just turf; they want full outdoor makeovers. We’re seeing a lot more demand for turf integrated with pavers, black star gravel, flower beds, and custom edging. It’s all about clean lines, contrast, and functionality. Turf has become a central building block for outdoor spaces that are built for hosting, relaxing, and enjoying.
