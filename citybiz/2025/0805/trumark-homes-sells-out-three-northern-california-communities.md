# Trumark Homes Sells Out Three Northern California Communities

Trumark Homes, the award-winning Western U.S. homebuilder, announced that it has sold out of three communities in Northern California, including Summit Collection in Castro Valley, Penny Lane in Concord and Jasper in Morgan Hill.

 “The sellout of these three distinct new home communities at Summit Collection, Penny Lane, and Jasper underscores the strong and consistent demand we are seeing in Northern California,” said Tony Bosowski, Northern California Division President for Trumark Homes. “Their popularity reflects the continued desire for thoughtfully designed homes of all sizes and types throughout the region.”

 Summit Collection opened in August 2024 and includes a total of 25 single-family estate-style homes ranging from 3,903 square feet to 4,366 square feet. Each home occupies nearly one-acre lots, offers stunning views and nearby amenities, and is surrounded by numerous hiking trails and acres of open space. Castro Valley is also home to the famous Rowell Ranch Rodeo to honor its notable ranching history.

 Penny Lane opened in September 2022 and includes a total of 70 three-story townhomes ranging from 1,610 square feet to 2,466 square feet. Located in Concord, the city was named America’s happiest city in a HouseFresh study and has been recognized as one of the best places in California to raise a family with outstanding schools and youth activities.

 Jasper opened in February 2022 and includes a total of 101 townhomes ranging from 1,403 to 2,270 square feet. Located in Morgan Hill, the city was ranked #32 on the list of California’s Safest Cities compiled by Safewise and is located on the Southern Edge of Silicon Valley and just 10 miles south of San Jose, and near to a Caltrain station downtown giving convenient access to the tech center hubs to the North.

 Trumark Homes’ Northern California division continues its growth trajectory as it prepares to open 11 new communities this year including Francis Ranch and Parkton in Dublin, Arroyo Crossings in Livermore, Skyline in Alameda, and Apricot Estates in Brentwood.

 “We will continue to build on this momentum as we expand our footprint to communities across the region,” added Bosowski. “We remain committed to delivering more housing and securing strategic land deals to serve the evolving needs of the market.”
