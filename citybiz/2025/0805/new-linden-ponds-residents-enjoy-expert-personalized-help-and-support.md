# New Linden Ponds Residents Enjoy Expert, Personalized Help and Support

One of the greatest benefits of joining the Priority List at Linden Ponds, an Erickson Senior Living community in Hingham, Mass., is exclusive access to Planning and Moving Consultant Lynne Smithson-Ford.

 Smithson-Ford, a 20-year veteran of Linden Ponds, provides personalized assistance on all aspects of moving–from space planning and selecting a real estate agent to downsizing and packing–to help seniors simplify their moves.

 “Sometimes, moving can seem challenging, especially if you’ve lived in a house for many years,” says Smithson-Ford. “That’s why I say it’s never too early to start the conversation. It’s a great way to talk through the process.”

 She adds, “I’m always happy to share information on the numerous resources and trusted moving professionals who’ve helped hundreds of people move to Linden Ponds.”

 First steps

 Impressed with the wide range of activities offered at Linden Ponds, Bonnie and Ralph DeOrsay decided to join the Priority List so they could learn more about the community.

 “Living in Marshfield, Mass., we knew lots of people who moved to Linden Ponds,” says Bonnie. “Joining the Priority List was a great way to keep in touch and attend some very informative events.”

 Though they weren’t quite ready to move, the DeOrsays decided to reach out to Smithson-Ford.

 “We knew there would be a lot to do to prepare to sell the farm and move,” says Bonnie, noting that they had lived in their house for 50 years.

 Help on the way

 After looking at several local retirement communities, the DeOrsays were impressed with the wide range of activities offered at Linden Ponds. They decided to join the Priority List and enjoy access to the many services Ford provides.

 Even before they decided on a floor plan, Smithson-Ford visited them in their house to offer advice, discuss customization options, and answer any questions they had.

 “Lynne came over to our house soon after we joined the Priority List,” she says. “During her visit, she reassured us by telling us that our house could be sold and that we would have support going through the move. It was nice to meet her and gather some ideas about selling the house.”

 Perfectly prepared

 Once Bonnie and Ralph found the perfect residence for their lifestyle–a two-bedroom, two-bath floor plan–Smithson-Ford visited their house once more to create a space plan and introduce the services of the community’s preferred real estate and moving vendors.

 “Lynne measured our furniture and helped us decide what to take with us,” says Bonnie. “She laid our furniture out on a copy of our floor plan. That was really helpful. We decided to use the second bedroom as a TV room and wanted to fit two comfortable chairs. She showed us how it would all work.”

 The DeOrsays also appreciated her recommendations and chose to work with three preferred vendors–a real estate agent, a local move manager, and a company to remove their unwanted items.

 “It really was a team effort,” says Bonnie. “We knew that our large 1864 farmhouse was unique and that we would need someone dedicated to help us with the sale. Christine, the real estate agent, was wonderful–a complete professional, honest and reliable. She not only helped us stage the house, she suggested minimal changes. I appreciated the fact that she was always accessible, returning every single text.”

 The couple worked with a preferred company for help clearing their barn, loft, and attic, and the local move manager, All the Right Things, packed their belongings with care.

 “Everyone was helpful and professional,” she says. “Natalie from All the Right Things knows Linden Ponds well and was able to make suggestions. For instance, she suggested taking some shelving for storage that I was going to throw away.”

 As a result of the expert preparation, move-in day for Bonnie, Ralph, and their dog Toby went off without a hitch. “It was a very positive experience,” notes Bonnie.

 Full steam ahead

 Since settling into their residence, the DeOrsays have been living life to the fullest. Ralph enjoys working in the woodshop and participating in the men’s discussion group, while Bonnie plays bridge and pickleball and participates in a campus book club.

 “Everyone is very friendly and welcoming,” says Bonnie. “We’ve been invited to dinner by neighbors quite a bit. We feel like we are really becoming part of the community. We are grateful for all the help we received in making our new life possible.”
