# Plymouth, Get Ready to Tumble: The Little Gym to Debut August 9, 2025

An internationally recognized child development and gymnastics program that promises to provide kids with serious fun and endless socialization will open August 9, 2025. The local owners of a new The Little Gym, the world’s premier enrichment and physical development center for children ages four months through 12 years, will serve the local Plymouth area in playing a crucial role in the development of thousands of local children.

 When high school sweethearts Pete and Kristen Marshall first walked through the doors of The Little Gym in the 1990s, it was as young parents looking to give their three children a joyful, active start in life. Decades later, they’re now grandparents—and after seeing their grandson light up at a Little Gym birthday party, they felt that old spark return. After successful careers—Pete in the IT industry, most recently with the parent company of Titleist and Kristen in real estate—the Marshalls began to envision their next chapter: one with more meaning, more impact and a passion to make a difference for children and families. Upon realizing there was no nearby The Little Gym to enroll their grandson the spark reignited and they reached out to the brand, and the conversation quickly became a commitment.

 “We raised our children with this experience, and now we get to create a space where today’s kids can grow, explore and shine, and where parents can connect, support each other and feel a little less alone in the journey,” said Kristen. “It’s more than a gym; it’s a place where families can grow stronger together.”

 Their new 4,000+ sq. ft. location will open its doors this August, creating 10 new jobs and a space where kids can be themselves, parents can find community, and every child has the chance to start strong. Locally owned and operated, The Little Gym of Plymouth is also managed by Pembroke native Sara Hall who has over twenty years of experience working in local gymnastics. Like Pete and Kristen, Sara is passionate about the role The Little Gym plays in early childhood development, fostering a safe, supportive space where kids can grow, explore, and simply be themselves. Sara reflects on what drives her: “Coming from a career in gymnastics, it’s incredibly fulfilling to give back to the sport and the community that shaped who I am. Ultimately, it’s about helping kids build confidence and creating a welcoming environment where families feel empowered to be part of that journey.”

 The Little Gym of Plymouth’s programs are designed to be a springboard for life’s adventures. Classes utilize movement-based learning and imaginative play to enhance coordination, listening and intellectual skills. Popular options include Parent/Child classes, which allow parents to help their child explore motor and social-skill development, and pre-Kand grade school gymnastics classes that teach students tumbling and apparatus techniques while using positive motivation as a learning tool. The Little Gym of Plymouth also offers Awesome Birthday Bashes in a variety of themes that feature instructor-led games and music as well as Camps, Parent Survival Nights and Member Events.

 With nearly 400 locations across 31 countries, The Little Gym teaches kids social and physical skills appropriate to each stage of childhood and aligned with the American Academy of Pediatrics milestones by creating opportunities to experience achievement and build self-confidence. The core of the international franchise’s mission is becoming the foundation of a child’s development that will set them up for success. Through a proprietary philosophy called Three-Dimensional learning, programs foster growth in three holistic dimensions including physical, cognitive, and social and emotional learning. The core teaching methods create opportunities for children to experience achievement and build self-confidence.

 The Plymouth gym will be open from 9am-7pm every day (closed on Fridays) and is available at 508-503-1038.
