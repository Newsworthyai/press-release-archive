# New Woodleigh Chase Residents Enjoy Expert, Personalized Help and Support

One of the greatest benefits of joining the Priority List at Woodleigh Chase, an Erickson Senior Living community in Fairfax, Va., is exclusive access to Planning and Moving Consultant Melissa Bates.

 Through the Erickson Realty and Moving Services program, Bates provides personalized assistance on all aspects of moving–from space planning and selecting a real estate agent to downsizing and packing–to help seniors simplify their transition to the community.

 Here to help

 In 2022, David and Jean Marble were already on the Priority List at Greenspring, an Erickson Senior Living community in Springfield, Va., when they learned that Woodleigh Chase was coming to Fairfax and decided to transfer their membership.

 “We were excited at the idea of moving to a brand-new community,” says David.

 “We were able to select a residence in January 2023, and by April 2024, we were moving in,” adds Jean.

 Leading up to their move, David and Jean took advantage of the many perks offered to Priority List members, including invitations to exclusive events.

 Helpful events

 “We attended monthly events on topics like moving, selling, and downsizing,” says Jean. “At one of the gatherings, they had a question-and-answer session with the preferred real estate agents they work with in this area. That really gave us a feel for how each agent works.”

 Trusted professionals

 To make their move even easier, David and Jean scheduled a personal home visit with Bates to plan how their furniture would work in a new layout and discuss customizations they were interested in.

 “The home visit from Melissa was very helpful,” says Jean. “She came to our house and asked what we wanted to take and what we didn’t want to take. She measured everything and then sent us a variety of floor plans that met our needs. She also explained the resources that were available to us, like downsizing experts, movers, and real estate agents in the area.”

 Bates works closely with accredited downsizing and moving professionals, auctioneers, and removal companies to ensure each move to Woodleigh Chase is seamless.

 “We thoroughly vet our network of preferred vendors and assess them annually,” says Bates. “We trust them 100%, as they have track records of delivering exceptional customer service.”

 Saving money

 Plus, using a real estate agent through Erickson Realty and Moving Services to sell your house makes you eligible for Woodleigh Chase’s Move On Us® program, which offers up to a $2,000 credit in qualified moving expenses.

 An easy process

 With the help of a preferred real estate agent and moving company, David and Jean were able to sell their former house in Gainesville, Va., in just one weekend and easily settle into their new residence at Woodleigh Chase.

 “Everything went as planned,” says David. “The movers arrived at our house in the morning, loaded everything up, and then drove to Woodleigh Chase and unloaded it.”

 Jean adds, “Melissa, along with Sales Director Nahid Young, guided us through the entire moving process. There was never a time that we had to chase Melissa down for a response. She always responded to us. She was accessible, very friendly, and always has a smile. Even now as we pass her in the hall, she greets me and says hello.”

 A new lifestyle

 Since moving to their new home, the Marbles have been living life to the fullest at Woodleigh Chase.

 “David loves the variety of the restaurants; he has more choices than he ever did at our house,” jokes Jean.

 The active couple makes use of the on-site swimming pool and volunteers as ambassadors for the community when prospective residents visit campus. Jean enjoys playing cards, while David participates in games like canasta and cornhole and is part of the Resident Advisory Council.

 Like many people who have already moved to an Erickson Senior Living community, David offers this sound advice: “Don’t wait! The sooner you can move, the sooner you can enjoy this lifestyle.”
