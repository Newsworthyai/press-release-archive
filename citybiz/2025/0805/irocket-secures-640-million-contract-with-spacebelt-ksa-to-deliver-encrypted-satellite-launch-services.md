 Innovative Rocket Technologies Inc. (iRocket), a next-generation reusable space rocket developer, and BPGC Acquisition Corp. (“BPGC”), a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by industrialist investor The Hon. Wilbur Ross, the 39th U.S. Secretary of Commerce with more than 55 years of private equity and investment banking experience, and BPGC Management LP, an independent private equity firm dedicated to opportunistic buyouts and special situations transactions in the global industrials, materials and chemicals sectors, announced today that iRocket has entered into a five-year launch integration, mission planning, and propulsion systems agreement with SpaceBelt KSA (“SpaceBelt KSA”), a Saudi-based space logistics and satellite security platform focused on building sovereign, encrypted communication infrastructure across the Gulf region, for a total contract value of up to $640 million.

 Asad Malik, CEO of iRocket, said, “This partnership places iRocket at the forefront of one of the most strategic and forward-looking space innovation initiatives in the Middle East, and, importantly, further validates our position as a go-to services provider. We believe that our multi-year agreement with SpaceBelt KSA reflects the global demand for securing economically viable and scalable space access as nations and corporations alike seek to strengthen their communication and surveillance capabilities.”

 “This relationship marks a significant step in our journey to become a regional and global leader in secure space operations,” commented Cliff Beek, CEO of SpaceBelt KSA. “Aligning our efforts with the iRocket team advances our vision to build sovereign space-based infrastructure for the Kingdom that delivers strategic value across defense, enterprise, and diplomacy sectors.”

 “As a private entity, we are proud to partner with leading innovators in space systems to develop the core infrastructure for sovereign space logistics, supporting both the national and commercial ambitions of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030,” said Eng. Mohammed Al-Tuwaijri, Co-Founder and Chairman of SpaceBelt KSA. “We hope this collaboration will not only strengthen Saudi Arabia’s technological capabilities and create new high-skilled jobs, but also enhance the Kingdom’s position as a regional leader in the space sector, attract international investment, and drive economic diversification for the benefit of all Saudis.”

 Under the agreement, iRocket will provide launch vehicle integration, mission planning, and propulsion system for up to 30 of SpaceBelt KSA’s upcoming orbital launches. The partnership includes multiple launches of satellite constellations, laying the foundation for a secure, resilient, and autonomous space-based communications network across Saudi Arabia and the broader Gulf Cooperation Council (“GCC”) region. The collaboration also includes joint testing and future launch operations within the GCC, paving the way for technology transfer, regional manufacturing, and the expansion of space-based capabilities that support both national security and commercial growth.

 SpaceBelt KSA’s mission is to secure the future of space-based communications platforms in Saudi Arabia and the region through its patented satellite technologies. By enabling encrypted satellite networks, secure data transmission, and digitally sovereign infrastructure, the Company is advancing a tech-driven future that supports Saudi Arabia’s broader space innovation strategy under Vision 2030.

 Forward-Looking Statements

 This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. BPGC’s, Holdco’s and/or iRocket’s actual results may differ from their expectations, estimates and projections and consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.

When we use words such as “may,” “will,” “intend,” “should,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,” “estimate” or similar expressions that do not relate solely to historical matters, it is making forward-looking statements.

 These forward-looking statements and factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the agreement with SpaceBelt KSA or a failure of SpaceBelt KSA to fulfill its obligations under the agreement; (2) iRocket’s future ability to provide launch services and recognize revenue under the agreement with SpaceBelt KSA; (3) iRocket’s ability to perform the agreement with SpaceBelt KSA in a cost-effective manner; (4) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement with respect to the Proposed Transaction, (5) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the parties following the announcement of the Proposed Transaction and definitive agreements with respect thereto; (6) the inability to complete the Proposed Transaction, including due to failure to obtain approval of the shareholders of iRocket and BPGC or other conditions to closing; (7) the inability to obtain or maintain the listing of Holdco’s shares on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange following the Proposed Transaction; (8) the ability of BPGC to become current in its SEC filings; (9) the risk that the Proposed Transaction disrupts current plans and operations as a result of the announcement and consummation of the Proposed Transaction; (10) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the Proposed Transaction, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably and retain its key employees; (11) costs related to the Proposed Transaction; (12) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (13) the inability of iRocket or Holdco to implement business plans, forecasts, and other expectations after the completion of the Proposed Transaction; (14) the risk that additional financing in connection with the Proposed Transaction, or additional capital needed following the Proposed Transaction to support iRocket’s or Holdco’s business or operations, may not be raised on favorable terms or at all; (15) the risk that iRocket’s signed letters of intent and memorandum of understandings may not result in definitive agreements or generate revenue; and (16) other risks and uncertainties included in documents filed or to be filed with the SEC by Holdco, iRocket and/or BPGC.

 The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. You should carefully consider the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties described in the “Risk Factors” section of the Registration Statement referenced above when available and other documents filed by Holdco, iRocket and BPGC from time to time with the SEC. These filings will identify and address other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. There may be additional risks that none of BPGC, Holdco or iRocket presently know, or that BPGC, Holdco, and/or iRocket currently believe are immaterial, that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. For these reasons, among others, investors and other interested persons are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K.
