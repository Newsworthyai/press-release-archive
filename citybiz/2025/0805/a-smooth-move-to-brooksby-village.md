# A Smooth Move to Brooksby Village

After living in her West Peabody, Mass., house for 52 years, Terry Diorio was ready to explore her senior living options–especially after dealing with increasing maintenance costs.

 Impressed by the maintenance-free residences and array of amenities at Brooksby Village, an Erickson Senior Living community in Peabody, Mass., Terry decided to schedule a visit.

 “I came up to Brooksby and met with the sales people, who were very helpful,” she recalls.

 Then, Terry joined the Priority List, which saved her spot in line for her perfect home. Her membership afforded many other perks as well, but the personalized planning and moving support she received was the most impactful one by far.

 She worked with a number of Brooksby’s preferred partners to streamline her move so she could start enjoying her new vibrant lifestyle from day one.

 To make the moving process even easier for incoming residents, Brooksby’s planning and moving consultant coordinates all the services they wish to use and offers complimentary home visits.

 Creating a plan

 Laurie Phillips, who recently retired from the role, speaks from experience.

 “I would go to a Priority List member’s house twice. The first home visit was spent getting to know them and understanding the challenges they might be anxious about, such as selling their house or downsizing,” she explains. “I used this visit to educate them on the process, answer questions, and get them excited about moving to our vibrant community.”

 She continues, “During the second visit, I would walk through the house and measure what furniture they were thinking of taking with them. Then, I would suggest where the furniture would fit best in their new living space and create a space plan for them.”

 Following the home visits, Phillips would put together a list of preferred vendors who could help execute a seamless move.

 “If the Priority List member wanted help selling their house and packing up their belongings, I would recommend some preferred real estate agents and a senior move manager,” she explains.

 Making the move

 Terry was happy to use all the vendors recommended to her, including a local real estate agent, who boasted years of experience in the area; a senior move manager, who helped her declutter, pack, and unpack; and a moving company to transport her belongings with care.

 “Everyone they recommended was wonderful,” Terry says. “They helped me sell my house and get it staged and told me what I needed to do to get the best price for it.”

 Terry’s daughter Tammy, who lives in Atlanta, Ga., also communicated regularly with the vendors helping Terry make a smooth move.

 “Everyone involved kept me well informed every step of the way. It gave me such peace of mind, knowing my mom was getting the support she needed,” Tammy says. “The real estate agent, Joyce Sullivan, was wonderful. I can’t say enough about how much help she was through the entire journey.”

 Terry adds, “Tammy’s husband Tim was extremely impressed with how everyone went above and beyond, making my move to Brooksby a positive one.”

 A new team member

 Since Phillips’ retirement, Brooksby has welcomed Jessica Kearns as the new planning and moving consultant! Kearns, formerly serving as a senior sales associate, has years of experience helping seniors start their next chapter.

 Kearns, excited about her new personal, hands-on role, says, “I look forward to meeting with all Priority List members moving forward. By planning ahead together, we can ensure that you’ll start enjoying community life from day one.”

 And that’s exactly what Terry has been doing. Since settling into her residence, she has taken advantage of the many amenities that Brooksby offers, especially the restaurants.

 “There’s so much to do here. I wanted to be active, so I figured this is the place for me!” says Terry. “Everyone did a tremendous job. My move was so smooth. I was really surprised how smooth it went.”
