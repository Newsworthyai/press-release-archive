# Datavault AI Showcases Digital Identity and Event Tech at NFL Hall of Fame, Wins Pinnacle Award

Datavault AI Inc. (Nasdaq: DVLT), , a leader in AI-powered data monetization and digital identity technologies, continues to build national momentum with high-profile industry engagements, award wins, and strategic product integrations. The company showcased its latest platforms, VerifyU, ADIO, and DVHOLO at the NFL Hall of Fame events in Canton (July 31 through August 3) and the 2025 NFL Preseason Opener, reaching a diverse national audience. Through its collaboration with NFL Alumni Health, Datavault AI will introduce VerifyU identity tokens to over 25,000 attendees and 200+ high-profile guests, marking a public debut of its secure AI-driven digital identity solution. The event features stakeholders from leading organizations including Walmart, the DEA, and SPIRE Academy, while ambassadors like Ray Lewis and Emmitt Smith amplify the initiative’s social reach to an audience of over 20 million.

 “Our continued momentum reflects strong product-market fit as we accelerate adoption across key verticals,” said Nate Bradley, CEO of Datavault AI. “From showcasing VerifyU at the NFL Hall of Fame to our expanded footprint in national trade shows, our technologies are entering a phase of scalable deployment.”

 In parallel with its consumer-facing initiatives, Datavault AI is strengthening its footprint in the $60B+ global event technology market. Through CompuSystems (CSI), its integrated event registration and engagement platform, Datavault’s ADIO and DVHOLO platforms are now deployed at major 2025 events such as ASSP, AWFS, SEBC, and Cosmoprof North America. These cross-market activations highlight the versatility and growing demand for immersive and AI-powered content delivery in both consumer and enterprise event environments.

 The company’s role in transforming the event space was recently profiled in Trade Show Executive, one of the industry’s most respected publications. The feature recognized how CSI’s integration of Datavault’s ADIO and DVHOLO technologies are redefining event engagement and audience analytics. Last month, Datavault AI was honored with a Pinnacle Award, a nationally recognized accolade celebrating excellence across key technology sectors, for its leadership in digital identity, spatial computing, and content distribution technologies.
