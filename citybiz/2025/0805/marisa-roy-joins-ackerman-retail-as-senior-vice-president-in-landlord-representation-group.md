# Marisa Roy Joins Ackerman Retail as Senior Vice President in Landlord Representation Group

Strengthening its Landlord Representation team, Ackerman Retail, a division of Ackerman & Co., has hired Marisa Roy, a retail leader with a long track record of success leasing high-profile retail centers across the Southeast. In her role as Senior Vice President, she’ll focus on leasing both Ackerman-owned and third-party retail developments, while also helping grow the firm’s portfolio of third-party retail clients.

 “We’re thrilled to welcome Marisa to our retail team,” said Leo Wiener, President of Ackerman Retail. “Her success representing both landlords and tenants gives her a unique perspective and valuable transaction expertise. Combined with her strong industry relationships, she’ll be a tremendous asset as we grow our landlord and third-party leasing platform.”As part of a focused effort to enhance the group’s landlord representation capabilities, Wiener plans to make additional strategic staffing hires.

 “Ackerman has a wonderful reputation in the industry. The people I know who work and have worked at Ackerman are some of the best-of-the-best in the industry,” said Roy.

 She added: “This is a great opportunity to work on in-house development and redevelopment projects and play a role in helping transform properties for the company. I’m looking forward to hitting the ground running to maintain our long-standing relationships with clients and grow the third-party portfolio.”

 In addition to leasing space for Ackerman’s third-party clients, Roy will spearhead retail leasing for several prominent Ackerman-owned projects, including Lee + White, one of Atlanta’s most successful large-scale adaptive reuse developments. In tandem with Ackerman Retail landlord leasing associate Patrick Green, she’ll also lease Ackerman’s 1200 White Street, a former warehouse now being transformed into a mixed-use destination offering a variety of retail space options; and Ackerman Retail and Novare Group’s two-building retail development in Sugar Hill, GA, a project that is part of a mixed-use development that includes hundreds of new apartments and is connected to the City of Sugar Hill’s entertainment district.

 Roy comes to Ackerman Retail from CBRE, where she worked for nearly seven years as Vice President of Retail Leasing, representing third-party owners in leasing a wide range of retail property types, from mixed-use developments to power centers and specialty retail, as well as providing tenant representation services for local and regional retail tenants.

 Ackerman Retail offers a comprehensive platform that includes development, landlord representation, tenant representation, investment sales and site selection, with a transaction history totaling nearly $2 billion.
