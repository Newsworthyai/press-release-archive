# New Riderwood Residents Enjoy Expert, Personalized Help and Support

One of the greatest benefits of joining the Priority List at Riderwood, an Erickson Senior Living community in Silver Spring, Md., is exclusive access to Planning and Moving Consultant Kara Shows.

 Shows provides personalized assistance on all aspects of moving–from space planning and selecting a real estate agent to downsizing and packing–to help seniors simplify their transition to the community.

 “My goal is to support Priority List members through every step of their move,”says Shows. “We have longstanding partnerships with trusted industry experts who not only know Riderwood but have proven themselves to be patient and professional. Together, we do all we can to ensure incoming residents are able to begin enjoying their new vibrant lifestyle from day one.”

 Toba and Tony Hausner worked closely with Shows in preparation for their October 2024 move to Riderwood from their house near downtown Silver Spring, and it was a game changer.

 “Working with Kara was the secret to making the move happen,”says Toba. “She was positive and encouraging, making us feel like although this was a big move, she would take away that daunting feeling–and she definitely did!”

 First steps

 After attending a Priority List event to learn more about the planning and moving services available to them, the Hausners contacted Shows to schedule a home visit–before they reserved a residence at Riderwood.

 During the home visit, Shows offered advice, discussed customization options, and answered any questions the couple had.

 “The home visit was very helpful,”says Toba. “Kara took a first look around, talking with us about what we wanted to bring and what she thought would fit in a new apartment home. She was very encouraging and supportive, telling us that we were in good shape to move.”

 She adds, “We appreciated that she provided a step-by-step process, telling us that we didn’t need to think about everything all at once.”

 Shows then worked with the Hausners to help them select a floor plan that would best meet their needs, which ended up being the Manchester.

 However, “While waiting for one on the top floor, Kara suggested we take a look at a Manchester located on the terrace level with an outdoor patio,”recalls Tony. “We were pleasantly surprised. We really liked the home, feeling it was an even better option for us than what we originally planned.”

 Perfectly prepared

 As plans for their move progressed, Shows provided the Hausners with the names of preferred real estate agents, senior move managers, and moving companies, each experienced with moving Priority

 List members to Riderwood.

 “We knew one of the preferred [real estate agents]–he had lived in our neighborhood. We decided that as soon as we were ready to move, we would use him,”says Toba. “In addition, we chose to work with preferred movers Town and Country, a decision that certainly made our move easier.”

 She continues, “Our move-in day was seamless! The movers arrived at our house early in the morning and went to work immediately, wrapping and packing. By late morning, they were ready to move us. When we arrived at Riderwood later in the afternoon, all of our belongings had been moved into our new home. It was very nice to have all our possessions here before we arrived.”

 As a result of all the detailed planning and support they received, Toba and Tony felt right at home.

 “Because of the plans we had made, the movers, who recorded everything, knew not only where to place our furniture, but how to duplicate the way things had been in our house,”explains Tony. “They arranged all the china in the cabinet, just as it had been.”

 “Our bed was made, our linens were out, and the boxes were taken away,”says Toba. “They even put things away in cabinets and labeled everything so we knew where to find things.”

 Full steam ahead

 Since settling into their residence, the Hausners have been living life to the fullest, taking part in activities with Riderwood’s Jewish community and hosting their two daughters and their families for dinner.

 In addition, Tony serves on the board of Riderwood’s Democratic Club and plays softball, while Toba enjoys opera class and photography club.

 “We are grateful for all the support we received and absolutely, hands down, recommend working with Kara,”says Toba. “She was our cheerleader, and we can’t say enough about all the people who helped us make our move to Riderwood. Each was supportive and caring, making us feel important and well-cared for.”
