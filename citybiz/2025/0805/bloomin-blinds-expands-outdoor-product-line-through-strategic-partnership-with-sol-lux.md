# Bloomin’ Blinds Expands Outdoor Product Line Through Strategic Partnership with Sol-Lux

Bloomin’ Blinds, the nation’s premiere window covering franchise, announces a strategic partnership with Sol-Lux, a leader in smart exterior shading. This collaboration brings Sol-Lux’s full suite of advanced retractable awnings and drop screens to Bloomin’ Blinds franchise locations across the U.S., expanding the brand’s outdoor offerings and empowering franchisees to tap into one of the industry’s fastest-growing segments.

 As part of this agreement, Bloomin’ Blinds franchisees will now offer Sol-Lux’s premium lineup of motorized outdoor shading products, including Mirage and Freedom motorized patio awnings, EOS autonomous window awnings, and MiraSol motorized drop screens for patios and pergolas.

 This partnership comes amid strong financial momentum, with franchisees reporting an impressive nearly 10% increase in average monthly revenue year-over-year*. Powered by advanced technology and strategic vendor partnerships, Bloomin’ Blinds is on track for a record-breaking year, delivering value and opportunity across its growing franchise network.

 “This partnership is all about empowering our franchisees with the tools they need to grow,” said Jeff Wharton, CEO of Bloomin’ Blinds. “By adding Sol-Lux’s proven exterior shading products to our lineup, we’re giving owners access to a high-demand category backed by decades of manufacturing expertise. It’s a turnkey opportunity for them to expand revenue, attract new customers, and strengthen their local positioning with smart, reliable solutions homeowners are already looking for.”

 Delivering Smart Shade Solutions with Franchise-First Focus

 Bloomin’ Blinds is known for its in-home consultations, repair-first approach, and high-touch customer service. The addition of Sol-Lux’s products aligns with the brand’s commitment to quality and convenience, helping homeowners improve comfort, reduce energy costs, and embrace smart automation, without sacrificing design.

 “Bloomin’ Blinds is a trusted brand with a proven model and strong customer relationships,” said Steve Brous, National Sales Manager at Sol-Lux. “This partnership allows us to align with a franchise network that values innovation and quality, while helping their owners tap into the high-growth exterior shading category with best-in-class products and support.”

 Building on its early 2025 partnership with Hunter Douglas, Bloomin’ Blinds’ expansion into the exterior market provides franchisees with new high-margin revenue stream potential, broader product offerings, and enhanced supply chain reliability across interior and exterior categories.

 Available now through participating Bloomin’ Blinds locations, the new outdoor shading line offers homeowners sleek, weather-resistant solutions engineered for performance, aesthetics, and ease of use.
