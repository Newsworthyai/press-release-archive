# Q&amp;A with Beth Hanschen, Co-Owner of Lindora Preston Forest

Beth Hanschen is the co-owner of Lindora Preston Forest, the first Texas location for the nationally recognized metabolic health brand. A Dallas-based entrepreneur and wellness advocate, Beth brings both personal conviction and operational discipline to her role as a Lindora franchisee. After personally experiencing the transformative impact of hormone therapy, she identified a gap in the local market for medically guided wellness solutions. Today, she is helping Dallas residents access science-backed, highly personalized care that addresses the root causes of fatigue, weight gain and hormonal imbalance. Her goal is simple but strategic—to make clinically informed care more accessible, approachable and sustainable for her community.

 Can you provide an overview of Lindora and the services it offers?

 Lindora is a wellness brand that focuses on metabolic health, weight management and hormone optimization through medically guided care. It was founded in 1971 and has helped millions of people through a model that’s built on clinical structure and personalized support.

 The services include weight loss programs, hormone replacement therapy, provider prescribed GLP 1s, IV hydration, wellness injections and nutritional coaching. Every member starts with lab work and a full health assessment so we can create a plan that actually fits their goals and their biology. Everything is overseen by licensed medical professionals, which is impactful in both safety and outcomes.

 A majority of Lindora’s locations are in California, but the brand is expanding to new markets. Our Preston Forest studio is the first one in Texas, which we’re extremely proud of. We already have a second location in the works in Addison, and we’re excited to keep growing in a way that brings this level of care to more people.

 What Inspired You to Bring Lindora to Dallas?

 Several years ago, I started experiencing constant fatigue, hair thinning, mental fog and a persistent sense that something wasn’t quite right. Like many women, I dismissed the symptoms as a byproduct of stress. Eventually I sought help and discovered hormone therapy. The shift was immediate and life changing. I felt like myself again, more energized, more focused and more in control of my health.

 That experience made me realize how many people are struggling with similar symptoms but don’t know where to turn. I started researching options and discovered Lindora. The brand stood out because of its clinical credibility, its legacy in the industry and its commitment to long-term, medically supervised wellness. I wasn’t interested in chasing trends. I wanted to bring something to Dallas that was proven, structured and capable of creating real outcomes. Lindora checked every box. The business model made sense, the brand values aligned with mine and I knew it was the right opportunity at the right time.

 Why did you choose to franchise with Lindora

 I saw an opportunity to bring a trusted model into a new market in a way that felt both strategic and personal. Lindora already had the clinical foundation, operational systems and brand equity in place. That gave me the freedom to focus on the areas that matter most to me: building the team, creating a strong culture and delivering an experience that feels personal and consistent for every member.

 Franchising with Lindora allowed me to move with purpose and clarity. I wasn’t starting from scratch—I was executing a model that works and adapting it thoughtfully for North Texas.

 What makes this launch important for the Dallas community?

 Dallas is a health-conscious city, but there’s still a noticeable gap between interest in wellness and access to personalized, clinically sound care. Many people are trying to self-manage complex health issues with digital tools or piecemeal services. That can be frustrating and ineffective.

 With Lindora, we’re offering something different: a centralized, in-person care experience that begins with lab testing and continues with a tailored plan monitored by medical professionals. Our members get structure, support and clear outcomes. It’s not a drop-in studio or a one-size-fits-all solution. It’s a wellness destination with accountability built in. That’s something this market has been ready for.

 What distinguishes Lindora from other players in the space?

 Lindora delivers personalized care backed by medical oversight, which is still rare in the wellness industry. Every plan is based on real diagnostics—lab work, health history and lifestyle goals. We never start with assumptions. We start with data.

 We also provide continuity. Members stay connected with our team as their care evolves. We monitor results, make adjustments and serve as a long-term partner. That consistency builds trust and delivers better outcomes over time. The model is not just supportive. It’s strategic.

 What has been most surprising since opening?

 The depth of the member response. I expected people to appreciate the convenience or the services, but I didn’t anticipate just how emotional this would be for so many. We’ve had clients say, “This is the first time I’ve felt heard,” or “I finally understand what’s going on with my body.”

 Those moments reinforce the importance of what we’re doing. While I didn’t create the Lindora brand, I am responsible for how it comes to life in this community. That means creating a space where people feel safe, supported and empowered. That’s the kind of culture we’ve built at Preston Forest.

 How do you approach more complex therapies like GLP-1s and hormone therapy?

 With clinical structure and clear communication. These therapies are effective when used responsibly, but they require oversight. We never start any treatment without a full medical evaluation, lab results and a conversation about individual goals and long-term plans.

 We also make education a priority. Our members understand what they’re doing and why. If someone isn’t a good fit for a particular therapy, we’re transparent about that too. Our role is not to follow trends. It’s to help people make informed, sustainable decisions about their health.

 What trends do you see shaping the future of wellness?

 Consumers are demanding more personalized, measurable care. They want to understand their own data, hormones, metabolism, inflammation and make decisions based on that insight. That shift is already happening, and I think it will accelerate in the coming years.

 We’re also seeing a more holistic definition of wellness. People want programs that integrate mindset, movement and recovery, not just weight loss. Lindora is well positioned to meet that need because the model is already built to evolve with the member. It’s not reactive. It’s proactive and strategic.

 What advice would you give to other entrepreneurs entering this space?

 Start with a clear purpose and a strong operating model. Wellness is an emotional category, and trust is everything. You need systems that deliver results, people who align with your values and a brand that can scale without losing quality.

 I chose to franchise because I believed in the Lindora model and wanted to focus on execution. That allowed me to build intentionally, from hiring to member experience to community engagement. You don’t have to build something alone to build something meaningful. You just have to lead with focus and integrity.

 What’s next for you and Lindora in North Texas?

 We’re committed to delivering excellent care at Preston Forest and ensuring every member experience reflects our values. We also have a second location underway in Addison and are exploring additional opportunities across the region.

 For me, growth is not just about footprint. It’s about impact. We want to be known as a trusted wellness partner that helps people feel better, think clearer and live stronger, with care that evolves as they do.
