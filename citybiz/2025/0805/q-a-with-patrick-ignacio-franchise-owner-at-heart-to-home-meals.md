# Q&amp;A with Patrick Ignacio, Franchise Owner at Heart to Home Meals

Patrick Ignacio is the first U.S. franchise owner of Heart to Home Meals, serving 17 counties across North Carolina. A pharmacist by profession and originally from the Philippines, Patrick combines his healthcare expertise with a passion for senior wellness, delivering nutritious, chef-prepared meals that support independence, dignity, and healthy aging in his community.

 For those unfamiliar, what is Heart to Home Meals and what makes it unique?

 Heart to Home Meals is a senior-focused meal delivery service offering over 160 nutritious, chef-prepared frozen meals designed with older adults in mind. What sets it apart is its dietitian-approved menu … covering diabetic, renal, heart-healthy, and other special dietary requirements that is delivered free with no contracts or subscriptions, making healthy eating truly accessible and stress-free.

 What inspired you to bring this franchise to Rocky Mount and the surrounding communities?

 Originally, in 2023, I wanted to launch a program for Rocky Mount focused on reducing dementia — I called it “Zero Dementia” initiative. But as I had conversations with my senior patients, I realized that one of the root causes was poor nutrition, particularly in underserved seniors. That shifted my focus to addressing the root cause of the problem through prevention, and Heart to Home Meals became the perfect platform to act on that mission by improving access to nutritious meals while supporting caregivers.

 How did you first learn about Heart to Home Meals and decide to become a franchisee?

 While researching solutions to help seniors eat better, I came across Heart to Home Meals. It immediately clicked with me, and it aligned with my healthcare background and my passion for helping the aging population live healthier lives. Rather than start from scratch, I chose to partner with Heart to Home Meals because they have the structure and experience to scale this vision quickly and effectively.

 What has the response been like since launching the business locally?

 The response has been incredibly encouraging. Seniors are grateful for the variety and convenience, and caregivers often tell us how much stress it has lifted from their daily routines. Community partners have also welcomed the initiative, seeing it as a much-needed resource in the community.

 Can you tell us a bit about your background and what led you to this new venture?

 I’m a pharmacist by profession, originally from the Philippines. Before coming to the U.S., I spent over a decade in pharmaceutical sales and managed a pharmacy, which gave me a deep understanding of both patient needs and the healthcare system. I migrated in 2011with my wife with just $200 and a desire to succeed and eventually become a pharmacist here in North Carolina. Heart to Home Meals allowed me to take that experience and channel it into a mission-driven business that supports senior health and independence.

 What do you hope to achieve with Heart to Home Meals in this community?

 I want to see our seniors live independently, with dignity and confidence in their health. I also want to be a partner and a support system for caregivers and give them a break and reassurance that their loved ones are getting nutritious meals without compromise. Ultimately, I hope this initiative contributes to preventing cognitive decline by promoting better nutrition.

 How do you ensure the meals meet the needs of older adults nutritionally?

 Each meal is designed and prepared by chefs and registered dietitians with seniors in mind, factoring in common health conditions like heart disease, diabetes, kidney and other health issues. We ensure meals are portion-controlled, flash-frozen to retain nutrition, color and flavor, and clearly labeled for ease and safety.

 What areas are you currently serving, and do you plan to expand?

 We’re currently serving 17 counties in North Carolina, including Wake, Nash, Wilson, Edgecombe, and Halifax. As we continue to build awareness and partnerships, we definitely plan to expand, especially into communities that need better access to senior nutrition services and expand the positioning even to young individuals with metabolic syndrome.

 What would you say to someone considering Heart to Home Meals for themselves or a loved one?

 Don’t wait, give it a try. Our meals are not just convenient and affordable; they’re made with care and health in mind. Whether you’re a senior looking for independence or a caregiver needing support, this service was built to make your life easier and your table healthier.

 Beyond nutrition, what kind of impact do you hope to make in the community through Heart to Home Meals?

 This is more than a meal delivery service; it’s about restoring wellness, dignity, and human connection. I want to open doors to better aging, spark conversations about dementia prevention through nutrition, and ultimately build a community where seniors are valued, nourished, and cared for.
