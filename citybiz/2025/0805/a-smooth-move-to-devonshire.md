# A Smooth Move to Devonshire

When Barbara Nestler was preparing for her move to Devonshire, the Erickson Senior Living community at PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., she knew exactly whom to reach out to–Planning and Moving Consultant Laurie Lovely.

 From space planning to recommending preferred real estate agents and moving companies, Lovely works with future Devonshire community members to streamline their moves–so they can start enjoying their new vibrant lifestyle from day one.

 “It’s never too early to get the help you need for a smooth, stress-free move,” says Lovely. “No matter your timeline, I can answer questions and provide resources so you can start to proactively plan ahead.”

 As a Priority List member, Barbara enjoyed several other perks, but this personalized planning and moving support was the most impactful by far.

 “I feel that Laurie is extremely knowledgeable in her field,” says Barbara. “She made my move so much easier, thanks to her expertise and assistance.”

 First steps

 As a proud PGA National Resort resident for three decades, Barbara knew that she wanted to move somewhere close.

 “Since I love living here, I wanted to stay,” recalls Barbara. “So, when Devonshire opened, I visited and toured apartment homes. I was very impressed with the size of the homes, but because I wasn’t ready to move in yet, I joined the Priority List.”

 After becoming a member, Barbara began receiving invitations to exclusive informational events–one of them being about Devonshire’s planning and moving services.

 “One of those wonderful benefits is a home visit,” says Barbara, who scheduled one with Lovely soon after the event.

 Because Barbara already had a residence in mind, it was easy for them to start working on a space plan.

 “Laurie measured all my furniture, and we discussed what I could take with me to my new home,” she explains. “She had a board with miniature couches and various furniture pieces, which she placed on the copy of my apartment home. This allowed me to see how it would all fit.”

 Lovely also used the home visit as an opportunity to help Barbara create a downsizing plan. “We talked about what items I could donate and how she could help me do that,” says Barbara.

 Working together

 Once Barbara felt comfortable with the layout of her new home, Lovely recommended several preferred vendors, all of which have been vetted for quality service.

 “She suggested real estate agents, moving companies, and a senior management team. All of Laurie’s recommendations were so helpful,” she says. “The real estate agent I chose was great. I thought it might take some time to sell my house, but it sold quickly.”

 When the time came to start packing, Barbara worked with both the senior move management team and a moving company that Laurie suggested.

 “First, the senior move management team came to my house. They were unbelievably helpful,” says Barbara. “They had the plan Laurie and I came up with, in regard to what furniture I would take with me to Devonshire. They took pictures of everything.”

 She continues, “The moving company was also excellent. They moved all my furniture without incident. I didn’t have to do anything! Thanks to the pictures taken before my move, everything was set up in my new home exactly as we planned. It was all so easy.”

 Full steam ahead

 Since her August 2023 move, Barbara has been living life to the fullest, playing mah-jongg, attending on-campus lectures, and participating in a variety of community events.

 “Everyone is so friendly and approachable, making it easy to make lasting relationships–and I certainly have,” she says. “My calendar is now filled with so many interesting things. I am very happy to live at Devonshire, free from all the maintenance of my former house while still living in the area I love.”

 Crediting Lovely for her seamless move, Barbara recommends her services to anyone considering a move to the community.

 “Laurie was instrumental in making my move a smooth one. I took all of her advice, and I feel that it had a very positive impact on my move,” notes Barbara. “She placed the pieces of the puzzle together, and she was very pleasant and patient to work with. Laurie knows what she is doing!”
