# American Humane Society Announces 25 Semi-Finalists of 15th Annual Hero Dog Awards

Voting is now open for the annual campaign to honor America’s top dogs

 Today, American Humane Society—the country’s first national animal welfare organization— is announcing the incredible semi-finalists for its annual Hero Dog Awards and encouraging the public to vote for their favorites.

 The Hero Dog Awards is a nationwide competition that searches for and recognizes America’s standout dogs in five categories: law enforcement and first responder dogs, service and guide dogs, therapy dogs, military dogs, and emerging hero dogs. Winners are ordinary canine companions that do extraordinary things—including saving lives as first responders, aiding their human best friend with sight or hearing and overall inspiring their communities.

 “We congratulate the incredible dogs who are nominated for the 15th Annual American Humane Hero Dog Awards,” said Dr. Robin Ganzert, President and CEO of American Humane Society. “The canine heroes represent courage, strength and love and their stories illustrate the uplifting healing power of the human-animal bond. We look forward to sharing their stories with America and encourage all to vote for the heroes on both ends of the leash.”

 People across the U.S. can vote for their four-legged champions at americanhumane.org/hero-dog-awards.
