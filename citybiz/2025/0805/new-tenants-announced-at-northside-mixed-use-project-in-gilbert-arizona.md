# New Tenants Announced at Northside Mixed-Use Project in Gilbert, Arizona

On behalf of Okland Capital and San Tan Development Group, Phoenix-based retail brokerage specialist Western Retail Advisors has completed a string of new leases at Northside at SanTan Village phase one, the retail and restaurant component of the Northside mixed-use development in Gilbert, Arizona.

 Located in the thriving SanTan Village corridor, Northside at SanTan Village phase one totals six buildings and 37,289 square feet, with shared outdoor spaces designed for guests to gather, relax and connect. It sits on the east side of Santan Village Parkway between Williams Field and Ray roads.

 In May, Perry’s Steakhouse & Grille announced it would lease 11,000 square feet as the projects phase one anchor, establishing its first-ever Arizona location. Additional tenants now joining Perry’s at Northside at SanTan Village include:

 * The Workshop Pilates, an Arizona-based Pilates leader leasing 4,275 square feet for its fourth studio.

 * The NOW Massage, a national massage brand establishing its fourth Arizona location with an 1,850-square-foot lease.

 * The Milkshake Factory, leasing 1,704 for its second Arizona location offering handspun milkshakes, ice cream and small-batch chocolates.

 * Face Foundrie, an elevated facial spa opening its fourth Arizona location with a 1,650-square-foot lease commitment.

 The new tenants bring Northside at SanTan Village to approximately 60% leased, with just five suites – ranging from 1,490 square feet to 4,336 square feet – available for lease.

 “This is an exciting next step for Northside at SanTan Village, where our first tenant commitments are quickly bringing our vision to life,” said Garret Clifford with Okland Capital. “We’ve taken a thoughtful approach to carefully curate a tenant mix that will create an elevated destination with retailers and restaurants not yet seen in the Southeast Valley. The remaining restaurant space at Northside at SanTan Village is experiencing a significant amount of demand from high-end dining options to popular fast-casual concepts. We’re excited to select a few of those restaurants to join the line-up soon. We appreciate the many project partners who are helping to make this happen.”

 Okland Construction serves as the general contractor at Northside and Aline Architecture Concepts is the retail center architect.

 Bryan Babits and Alberto Caballero of Western Retail Advisors are the project’s exclusive retail and restaurant leasing brokers.

 “The location and design of Northside at SanTan Village deliver exactly what today’s premier retailers and restaurants are looking for,” said Babits. “This has generated extremely strong leasing interest in this property, and positioned it as a success story that will bring new tastes and experiences to the submarket.”

 Northside at SanTan Village phase one is under construction now, with project completion and tenant grand openings anticipated for Q1 2026.

 The project is part of the larger Northside master plan, being developed by Okland Capital and San Tan Development Group. At build-out Northside will total 20 acres with restaurants and retailers, a 134-key hotel, and future mixed-use assets fronting the Loop 202 freeway. The master plan also includes shared community spaces and a walking loop, providing added amenities for all patrons.
