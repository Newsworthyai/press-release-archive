# Black Duck Debuts Major Upgrades to AI-Powered Security Assistant at Black Hat 2025

Black Duck® Software, Inc., a leading global provider of application security solutions, today announced significant enhancements to its AI-powered application security assistant, Black Duck Assist, which is now directly integrated into the company’s Code Sight IDE plugin. These new capabilities bring automated security scanning for AI-generated code and AI-driven code fixes directly into developer environments to ensure seamless protection of application code.

 

 According to Gartner, “Generative AI will deliver the greatest impact when adjacent activities complement the gains in coding efficiency. For example, AI code security assistants and AI-augmented software-testing tools can help reduce the mismatch in cadence between coding, scanning and testing activities.”1

 Through the Code Sight IDE plugin, Black Duck Assist automatically scans code in real time as it is written by developers or generated by AI coding assistants. It identifies security vulnerabilities and potential IP violations, allowing these issues to be addressed before developers proceed to other tasks.

 Black Duck Assist also provides developers with AI-generated vulnerability summaries, code analysis, and code fix suggestions directly within their development environment, allowing them to deliver secure, compliant code quickly without switching tools or involving security experts.

 In addition to traditional IDEs like Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Visual Studio, Code Sight is now available for AI code editors such as Cursor and Windsurf. This enables developers to safely and securely incorporate code generated by AI coding assistants, including GitHub CoPilot and Claude Code.

 Additionally, Black Duck Assist now supports natural language queries in both the IDE and the Polaris platform, allowing users to easily access project statistics, testing results, and trends, as well as obtain answers to product configuration and functionality questions.

 “These advancements underscore Black Duck’s commitment to harnessing the power of AI to enhance our products and help our customers securely and confidently embrace the benefits of AI-augmented development,” said Dipto Chakravarty, Chief Product and Technology Officer at Black Duck. “By extending Black Duck Assist directly into the developer’s workflow, we empower them to build secure software faster and more efficiently than ever before.”

 Black Duck will showcase Black Duck Assist in Code Sight at booth #5242 at the Black Hat Conference in Las Vegas on August 6-7, 2025.
