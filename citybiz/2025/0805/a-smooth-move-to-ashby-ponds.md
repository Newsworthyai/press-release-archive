# A Smooth Move to Ashby Ponds

When Sandy and Paul Wischow were preparing for their move to Ashby Ponds, an Erickson Senior Living community in Ashburn, Va., from their house in Reston, Va., they knew exactly whom to reach out to–Planning and Moving Consultant Isabel “Izzy” Wilson.

 “Izzy is wonderful. She was with us throughout the entire moving process,” says Sandy. “She answered all our questions, offered advice, and coordinated the efforts of everyone helping us with the move.”

 Priority List perks

 As members of Ashby Ponds’ Priority List, the Wischows enjoyed a range of valuable perks, but this personalized planning and moving support was the most impactful one by far.

 “There is a tremendous benefit to having someone else find the perfect people for your move,” says Paul.

 From space planning to recommending preferred real estate agents and moving companies, Wilson works with future Ashby Ponds residents to streamline their moves–so they can start enjoying their new vibrant lifestyle from day one.

 “My goal is to make your move as easy and stress-free as possible,” says Wilson. “Whether you’re moving from down the street or out-of-state, I’m able to coordinate the resources needed for a successful move.”

 First steps

 After attending a Priority List event to learn more about the planning and moving services available to them, Sandy and Paul contacted Wilson to schedule a home visit.

 During the home visit, Wilson measured their furniture, discussed floor plan and customization options, and answered any questions the couple had.

 “It was really helpful to start the conversation early. The visit gave us a good idea of what we could take with us,” says Sandy. “We were never pressured, just given valuable information.”

 Two years later, when the couple selected their floor plan and were ready to move, Wilson returned to their house–accompanied by a member of the community’s preferred senior move management company–to finalize space planning.

 “Using a copy of our floor plan, Izzy showed us what we could bring and how it would all fit,” says Paul. “We were able to make decisions based on the plan. That was very helpful.”

 Wilson also recommended two preferred real estate agents based on their expertise and knowledge of the Reston area.

 “We talked with both,” says Sandy. “We chose Meg Olympia from Long and Foster, and she was absolutely fantastic! She told us what she thought our house would sell for, predicting it would sell quickly. She also suggested we move to Ashby Ponds first and then put the house on the market.”

 Olympia’s prediction was spot on, as they received two offers within three days of their house being on

 the market.

 “She knew exactly what the best approach was for us, and she was absolutely right!” says Paul. “It was a great decision.”

 Working together

 Leading up to their move, Sandy and Paul worked closely with Wilson and the senior move management company to donate and sell some of their items.

 “We really appreciate that we were able to give a lot of stuff away to people who would enjoy and appreciate the items,” says Paul. “Some of our things were even auctioned, which meant that we received a nice check for all the things they were able to sell.”

 The couple also received assistance packing and moving their belongings to Ashby Ponds.

 “The moving company even moved our piano to our daughter’s house in Herndon. It was so nice to not have to find someone else to do that,” says Sandy.

 On move-in day, the movers made sure the couple’s bed was made and kitchen items were unpacked, so they could begin living in their new space comfortably right away.

 “Everyone was fabulous,” notes Paul.

 Full steam ahead

 Since their February 2024 move, the Wischows have been living life to the fullest, hosting their children and grandchildren in their new home and participating in a variety of on-campus activities, including bocce, pickleball, game nights, and happy hours.

 “We are grateful for all the help we received to help make this new life possible. And we would absolutely recommend working with Izzy and her team,” says Paul. “We are very happy to call Ashby Ponds home!”
