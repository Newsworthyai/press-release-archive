# A New Best Friend for Burlington Pet Owners: Pet Supplies Plus Opens Its Doors

Pet Supplies Plus will open a new location on August 16 at 139 Cascade Mall Dr. in Burlington to offer pet parents a hassle-free shopping experience with a wide selection of pet products at the best price guaranteed. Known for its friendly staff and helpful customer service, Pet Supplies Plus helps local pet parents save money and celebrate the fun of pet ownership, offering a wide array of natural pet foods and products for cats, dogs, reptiles, birds, fish, and small animals, along with amenities such as a full-service grooming salon, self-pet wash stations, a knowledgeable pet care team, and carry-out service, where team members carry heavy items to neighbors’ cars. Whether shopping in-store or online, choosing a local is easy at Pet Supplies Plus in Burlington.

 Pet Supplies Plus focuses on providing a unique in-store experience for all of its new “neighbors” (the term Pet Supplies Plus uses for customer). Local entrepreneur Gina McMann owns the new store. For McMann, it’s more than a business, it’s the beginning of a family legacy she hopes to pass on to her son, who will be helping run the store from day one. McMann grew up with entrepreneurship in her blood and animals in her heart. Inspired by her mother, a former franchisor, and driven by her son’s deep love for animals, McMann found the perfect fit in Pet Supplies Plus. McMann, born and raised in the area, has been a longtime admirer of her small-town’s charm and strong community spirit—ultimately deciding it was the ideal location for her first store. Set to open July 18 at approximately 6,000 square feet, the new Pet Supplies Plus will bring eight to ten new jobs to the area and offer a welcoming neighborhood resource for pet parents.

 As a community partner, Gina McMann, will work alongside local animal shelters, rescue organizations and non-profits to host year-round adoption events, fundraisers, pet food and product drives.

 “Opening Pet Supplies Plus in Burlington has been a dream of mine to connect generations of my family and our love for animals,” said Gina McMann. “This community deserves a place where pets are treated like family, and that’s exactly what we’re bringing. My hope is that this store becomes more than just a pet shop—it becomes a trusted part of the neighborhood, where every wag, purr, and happy tail feels right at home.”

 To welcome the community to the new Pet Supplies Plus location, McMann will host a weekend-long grand opening event featuring a $10 reward for any $30 purchase, special prize giveaways, huge discounts, and more. The free Pet Supplies Plus Rewards program allows members to receive regular coupons on products they frequently purchase, monthly specials, members only sales, and other personalized offers.

 Beginning on Saturday, August 16 and continuing through Sunday, August 17, grand opening festivities at the new Pet Supplies Plus will include:

 * Saturday, August 16 – Sunday, August 17 – Pet Supplies Plus will provide complimentary pet photos and free pet washes. Rewards members earn a $10 Reward (2,000 points) with any purchase of $30 or more.
* Saturday, August 16 – Mystery scratch cards will be given to neighbors throughout the day, up to $10 value. Pooch Parfaits will also be offered on-site.
* Sunday, August 17 – The first 100 neighbors will receive one free small bag of dog or cat food (doors open at 10am). Fifty neighbors will enjoy 40% off tropical fish and aquatic plants. An ice cream truck will also be on-site.
