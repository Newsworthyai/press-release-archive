# New Siena Lakes Residents Enjoy Expert, Personalized Help and Support

In January, when Pat Forbes and her husband, Pat Keating, moved to their two-bedroom, two-bath home in Siena Lakes, the Erickson Senior Living community in Naples, Fla., they were absolutely thrilled that everything went so smoothly.

 That’s because the couple had guidance and support from Kristine Kluge, planning and moving consultant at Siena Lakes.

 As part of Erickson Realty and Moving Services, Kluge connects Priority List members with trusted resources, including real estate professionals, downsizing and packing experts, and senior moving companies committed to providing future residents a seamless and stress-free move.

 “I have nothing but good things to say about our entire move-in experience,” says Pat Forbes. “Erickson Realty and Moving Services is run like a well-oiled machine!”

 Personalized experiences

 With over 32 years of experience working with people moving to an Erickson Senior Living community, Kluge specializes in helping seniors simplify their moves.

 “The first step is setting up a home visit,” she says. “Visiting future residents in their homes provides a wonderful opportunity to talk about what they need. We then walk through the home, and they show me how they live in their current space, and the things they love. It’s a very personalized experience.”

 During Kluge’s visit to their home, the ‘two Pats,’ as they’re known, shared the “wish list” of furniture they wanted to bring with them to Siena Lakes. Kluge measured each piece of furniture, then, using a magnetic board with small pieces representing the furniture, illustrated how it would fit in their new home.

 “People love that magnetic board. It helps them to see how their new residence will look,” says Kluge.

 “After our home visit, Kristine sent us floor plans we had created together mapping out our furniture. We found it helpful, and our movers used it to place our things in the correct spots,” says Pat Forbes.

 Pat Keating adds, “Our visit was fabulous, and Kristine was accommodating and willing to help. She was outstanding!”

 While visiting the couple in their home, Kluge also provided a list of trusted moving professionals, including real estate agents, senior move managers, and moving companies–all of whom the couple chose to work with in preparation for their move.

 Helpful suggestions

 Heeding Kluge’s expert advice, the couple chose to work with preferred real estate agents Lynne Hancock and Marc Galanto with John R. Wood Properties. With years of experience, they provided a suggested asking price and offered advice on how to prepare their house for sale.

 “We thought we might have to paint, but they told us not to worry about it,” says Pat Keating.

 They also suggested removing the home’s patterned carpets to allow potential buyers to focus on the house itself.

 The couple agreed and then headed out of town for a short trip.

 “Four days later, we came back to a signed sales agreement!” says Pat Forbes. “They were professional, helpful, forthright, and understanding. They made the process as seamless as it can be.”

 Phenomenal packing

 The couple also chose to work with preferred senior move manager Turn Key Senior Transitions & Design for assistance with packing, moving, and unpacking.

 “The recommended movers were fantastic. They came to our house and took pictures of everything. They then packed our belongings carefully and quickly,” says Pat Forbes.

 “The next day, we came to our new home, and everything was in its place. From our pots and pans to our clothing, everything was put away. What a relief. We were so pleased,” she adds.

 And because the couple used Erickson Realty and Moving Services’ preferred real estate agents, they qualified for up to a $2,000 savings on their moving costs as part of the Move On Us® program.

 Never too early

 When Pat Keating attended a lecture about aging, the speaker said this about moving: “Better five years too early than five minutes too late.”

 Since their move, the couple is living life to the fullest, enjoying work outs, Sunday socials, Friday happy hours, lectures, and dinner with new friends.

 “It’s never too early to invite a planning and moving consultant come out to your home,” says Kluge. “There’s a real sense of relief that comes from knowing that you don’t have to do this move by yourselves. You’ll have a lot of people on your team.”
