# Pegasus Names George Azzi EVP Amid New Hires and Milestone Executive Anniversaries

Pegasus proudly announces the appointment of George Azzi as Executive Vice President, a pivotal addition following his distinguished tenure as Regional Manager of Marcus & Millichap’s Los Angeles office, and the first in a trio of strategic new hires. Azzi brings two decades of commercial real estate experience in Los Angeles County, with a proven track record of leading top-performing brokerage teams and executing more than $2 billion in sales across 400+ transactions. At Pegasus, Azzi will lead the firm’s advisor growth strategy, overseeing recruitment and professional development while driving performance across the advisory platform. He will also play a key role in expanding service line offerings and broadening asset class coverage as Pegasus deepens its market presence.

 Bahram Fattahinia joins Pegasus as Director of Marketing, bringing 15 years of experience leading brand and performance marketing across top-tier real estate, hospitality, and financial institutions. An extended tenure with Irvine Company helped hone his refined approach to brand stewardship and elevated service—an ethos he will now employ to spearhead the firm’s focus on marketing innovation and best-in-class audience engagement.

 Daniel Kim, newly-appointed Senior Associate of Finance & Strategy, will lead corporate FP&A, data analytics, and operational systems. With experience in private equity and portfolio management, Kim will also lead the development of Pegasus’s strategic planning, growth, and financial reporting infrastructure, with a key specialization in leveraging technology.

 Celebrating a Decade of Leadership and Growth

 Pegasus is also proud to recognize the 10-year anniversaries of two key executives: Daylin Ackerman, Managing Director, and Seth Bell, President, both of whom have played instrumental roles in shaping the firm’s success over the past decade.

 Since joining the firm in 2015, Ackerman has been integral to the expansion of Pegasus’ investment sales and advisory business. With a background in capital markets and financial strategy, he has helped cultivate the firm’s reputation for high-touch client service and data-informed dealmaking.

 Reflecting on his decade at Pegasus, Ackerman shared, “Decades tend to fly by when you love what you do and the people you do it with. We’ve worked tirelessly to uphold the highest standards of service for our clients, always. I’m incredibly proud to be a meaningful part of the company Pegasus has become. The best is yet to come, as the firm stands poised for remarkable growth and success in the decade ahead.”

 Bell, who joined Pegasus in 2014, has been the driving force behind the firm’s asset management division. Under his leadership, Pegasus launched its construction & project management platform, in addition to a leasing advisory, now overseeing more than 370 commercial properties totaling $3.7 billion in asset value. His focus on operational excellence and long-term value creation has been instrumental in optimizing performance for Pegasus’ clientele and maximizing long-term value for property owners.

 “Over the past decade, we’ve pushed relentlessly to build something exceptional at Pegasus, and we’ve done it with purpose, conviction, and a deep commitment to our clients,” said Bell. “We set out to create a firm that would raise the bar in commercial real estate, and today, I can say with confidence that we’ve done just that, but this is just the beginning. Welcoming George, Bahram, and Daniel marks the start of an exciting new chapter. With the collective experience and vision we now have at Pegasus, we’re positioned to scale faster, think bigger, and lead more boldly than ever before. The future isn’t just bright, it’s ours to shape.”

 David Chasin, CEO, commented on the series of milestones: “It’s hard to overstate the impact that both Seth and Daylin have had on Pegasus over the past decade. Their leadership, loyalty, and relentless pursuit of excellence have helped shape the firm into what it is today—a trusted, strategic partner to sophisticated commercial real estate owners across the country. As we celebrate this important milestone, we’re equally thrilled to welcome George, Bahram, and Daniel to the Pegasus family. Each of them brings world-class experience that will help us continue to scale with purpose, intelligence, and integrity. This is the most energized and optimistic I’ve ever felt about the future of Pegasus. We are not just brokering transactions and managing properties—we are building a new model by marrying wealth management and commercial real estate advisory. Our growth is accelerating, our platform is deepening, and we’re only just getting started.”
