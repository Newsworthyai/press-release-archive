# David Nevins Interviews Georganne Hale, Senior Vice President of Racing, Maryland Jockey Club

A pioneer in Thoroughbred racing in Maryland, Georganne Hale is the Senior Vice President of Racing with the Maryland Jockey Club.

 Hale’s impactful career with the organization began in 1984 as an assistant racing secretary. After taking on the role of Racing Secretary at the Maryland State Fair at Timonium in 1986, she became the first and only woman to serve as racing secretary at a major North American racetrack when promoted to the position in 2000 by the Maryland Jockey Club. In 2018, she was named Vice President of Racing Development.

 Hale has been instrumental in building the crown jewels of Maryland’s racing circuit, including the Preakness Stakes, Black-Eyed Susan Stakes, and Maryland Million programs. Hale has also fostered strong partnerships with owners, breeders, and trainers across North America.

 Beyond her administrative roles, Georganne is a dedicated mentor to many racing officials and a passionate advocate for Thoroughbred aftercare. She works closely with Maryland’s Beyond the Wire aftercare program and the Thoroughbred Aftercare Alliance, among other vital causes. As the lead on philanthropic projects for The Maryland Jockey Club, she initiated and ran the All-Thoroughbred Horse Show at Pimlico for five years, and she continues to coordinate the annual Canter for a Cause event.

 Her profound contributions and leadership have earned her significant recognition, including the 2025 Baltimore Business Journal Women Who Mean Business award, the Jane Goldstein Exemplary Leadership Award from the Horse Racing Women’s Summit (2024), and the Joe Kelly Unsung Hero Award from the Maryland Million Board of Directors (2018).
