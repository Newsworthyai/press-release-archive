 CHARLOTTE, N.C., Aug. 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Duke Energy today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement for Brookfield, through its Super-Core Infrastructure strategy, to hold a 19.7% indirect equity interest in Duke Energy Florida for an aggregate amount of $6 billion. Brookfield is a leading infrastructure investor, with over $200 billion in assets under management across the utilities, transport, midstream and data sectors.

 The all-cash transaction is an attractive and efficient form of financing. The investment supports Duke Energy’s ability to serve customers in its fast-growing electric and gas utilities, strengthens its balance sheet and funds ongoing capital needs associated with its energy modernization strategy.

 The investment represents a significant premium to Duke Energy’s current public equity valuation. Two billion dollars of the proceeds from the transaction will fund Duke Energy’s increased $87 billion, five-year capital plan and $4 billion will be used to displace holding company debt.

 “For more than a century, we’ve had the privilege of serving extraordinary Florida communities, which are now some of the most dynamic and fastest growing in the nation,” said Harry Sideris, president and chief executive officer. “We’re pleased to have Brookfield, a highly regarded infrastructure investor, as a long-term partner in Duke Energy Florida. This significant transaction at a compelling valuation best positions Duke Energy to unlock additional capital investments in Duke Energy Florida during this unprecedented growth period. It also materially strengthens Duke Energy’s overall credit profile, which in turn enables us to invest in our energy modernization plans across our entire footprint – all while helping keep prices as low as possible for our customers.”

 “We are delighted to partner with Duke Energy in a critical business and premier regulated utility like Duke Energy Florida through Brookfield’s Super-Core Infrastructure strategy. We look forward to supporting the continued growth of Duke Energy Florida’s regulated asset base and, accordingly, ensuring excellent service delivery for its customers,” said Sam Pollock, chief executive officer of Brookfield’s infrastructure group. “This transaction underscores our patient strategy of partnering with leading corporates and investing in essential infrastructure assets that underpin economic growth, and that generate stable long-term cash flows across market cycles.”

 Duke Energy Florida is a vertically integrated electric utility company providing critical services to 2 million customers across central and western Florida. The $4 billion increase in Duke Energy Florida’s five-year capital plan takes total investment in the state to over $16 billion through 2029. This plan is underpinned by grid modernization and resiliency initiatives, as well as generation capacity enhancements to support the dynamic service territory and expanding customer base.

 “Duke Energy’s commitment to our customers and communities is unwavering, driving us to continuously find innovative ways to meet the moment for our customers. This exciting partnership allows us to do just that,” said Melissa Seixas, Duke Energy Florida state president. “This partnership will create value for all of our communities as we invest in generation, transmission and distribution enhancements that increase reliability, maintain affordability and support future economic development in our state.”

 Transaction structure

 Brookfield will invest in Florida Progress, which owns all of Duke Energy Florida. Brookfield will acquire its indirect equity interest in Duke Energy Florida in phases, with Florida Progress receiving $2.8 billion at the first closing expected to occur in early 2026 and another $200 million by the end of 2026. An additional $2 billion will be received in 2027 and the remaining $1 billion will be received in 2028. Brookfield has the option to fund the total $6 billion investment sooner.

 Duke Energy will retain an 80.3% interest in the business and will continue to operate Duke Energy Florida with its best-in-class workforce. Brookfield will receive certain rights commensurate with its ownership interest.
