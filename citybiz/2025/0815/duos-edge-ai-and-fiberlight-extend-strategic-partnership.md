# Duos Edge AI and FiberLight Extend Strategic Partnership

Duos Technologies Group, Inc. (“Duos” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: DUOT), through its operating subsidiary Duos Edge AI, Inc. (“Duos Edge AI”), a provider of adaptive, versatile and streamlined Edge Data Center (“EDC”) solutions tailored to meet evolving needs in any environment, today announced the expansion of its strategic partnership with FiberLight, LLC, a leading provider of high-capacity fiber optic networks and connectivity services. This alliance builds on the companies’ collaboration in Texas. It marks a major milestone in delivering low-latency, localized compute infrastructure to underserved and high-growth markets across the United States.

 The partnership will accelerate the deployment of Duos Edge AI’s modular, SOC 2 Type II compliant EDCs, purpose-built for rapid delivery, energy efficiency, and high availability. These deployments are strengthened by FiberLight’s expansive fiber network, which includes approximately 75 route miles of regional infrastructure in Corpus Christi and connects to more than 13,000 route miles across Texas. With direct links to major markets, including San Antonio, Austin, Dallas, Houston, McAllen, Laredo, and El Paso, this collaboration ensures fast and reliable access to next-generation infrastructure supporting education, healthcare, enterprise, and AI-driven applications in both urban and rural communities.

 “Expanding our partnership with FiberLight is a significant step forward in our mission,” said Doug Recker, President and Founder of Duos Edge AI. “Their extensive fiber network, combined with our rapidly deployable edge data centers, allows us to deliver scalable, high-performance solutions where they’re needed most—faster than ever before.”

 The strength of the partnership was recently demonstrated in Corpus Christi, where FiberLight needed to quickly reestablish its primary point-of-presence (POP) to maintain connectivity in the region, and Duos Edge AI presented the most efficient and cost-effective path forward. Working closely with city officials, the property owner, and AEP, FiberLight and Duos Edge AI collaborated to deploy a new EDC just 30 feet from FiberLight’s existing infrastructure. The expedited permitting and installation process eliminated the need for more than 2,000 feet of new construction, resulting in significant cost savings and minimizing downtime for local customers.

 “This expanded partnership builds on the proven success we’ve had together in Texas,” said Tyler Coates, Chief Revenue Officer at FiberLight. “The Corpus Christi project shows how Duos Edge AI brings more than just edge data center capabilities; they add real value for our customers by helping us deliver innovative infrastructure solutions quickly and efficiently. Together, we’re expanding our reach, enhancing service delivery, and driving the next wave of innovation and economic development.”

 Duos Edge AI is currently on track to contract 15 EDCs by the end of 2025, with active deployments underway in Texas and more planned for the Midwest and Southeastern U.S. This expanded partnership with FiberLight enables joint planning around site selection, connectivity, and turnkey deployment in markets where infrastructure is most needed.
