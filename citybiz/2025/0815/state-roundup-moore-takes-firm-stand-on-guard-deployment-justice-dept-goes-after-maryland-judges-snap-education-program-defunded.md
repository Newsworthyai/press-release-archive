# State Roundup: Moore Takes Firm Stand On Guard Deployment; Justice Dept Goes After Maryland Judges; SNAP Education Program Defunded

MOORE TAKES FIRM STAND ON GUARD DEPLOYMENT: Gov. Wes Moore said he will not authorize the deployment of the Maryland National Guard to combat crime in areas like Baltimore City during two nationally televised news interviews, while the Baltimore police union and the White House say that the governor cannot have it both ways. Gary Collins/WBFF-TV News.

 * Moore addressed the potential deployment of federal troops in Baltimore said the president’s decision “lacks seriousness and is deeply dangerous. He said he was heartbroken for members of the National Guard for “I take very seriously how when and why I deploy our National Guard.” Anderson Cooper 360/CNN.

 JUSTICE DEPT PITS ITSELF AGAINST MARYLAND FEDERAL BENCH: The Justice Department’s lawsuit against all 15 federal district judges in Maryland over limits to the pace of deportations was met with skepticism Wednesday by another judge, who presided over a rare courtroom battle pitting the executive branch against the judiciary. Salvador Rizzo/The Washington Post.

 * The case centers on a standing order issued in May by Chief Judge George L. Russell III, in which he ordered a 48-hour pause in every case in which an immigrant had tried to block deportation by challenging the legality of their detention. The Justice Department called the move “an extraordinary form of judicial interference” and sued the entire bench. Lawyers for the judges called the move unprecedented and improper.

 STATE SNAP EDUCATION PROGRAM TO CLOSE, 70 TO LOSE JOBS: The SNAP-Ed program in Maryland, which offers nutrition education to low-income families and SNAP participants, is set to be defunded by Oct. 1. The move comes due to new provisions in the Big Beautiful Bill signed into law in July. In fiscal year 2024, it received nearly $6.3 million in federal funds. The program closure cuts 70 employees and impacts 700 community partners including schools, Head Start Centers, Judy Centers and other food access programs. Breana Ross/WBAL-TV.

 HEAT DEATH TOLL RISES TO DECADE RECORD OF 29: Maryland has recorded 29 heat-related deaths so far this summer — surpassing the total number of people who died from heat illness in 2024, which had already been a deadlier-than-usual summer. With four new heat-related deaths reported Wednesday by the Maryland Department of Health, heat has claimed more lives in Maryland this summer than in any other year in over a decade.

 ‘STOP OFFSHORE WIND’ SIGNS DECORATE OCEAN CITY DURING MACO: Drive up and down Coastal Highway in Ocean City during the Maryland Association of Counties convention this week and you’re sure to see at least one. Whether it appears on an electronic sign or tacked to a hotel, the message is usually simple: “Stop offshore wind.” The new head of the Maryland Democratic Party is wasting little time setting a more confrontational tone with Republican President Donald Trump. In press releases and social media, the party led by Steuart Pittman, is taking a more aggressive posture. Bryan P. Sears, Danielle J. Brown and Christine Condon/Maryland Matters.

 LAWMAKERS GET $10.2M FROM BUSINESSES THAT WON STATE CONTRACTS: Maryland politicians collected more than $10.2 million in campaign donations from businesses that won billions of dollars in state contracts or paid lobbyists to influence them since the 2022 election. Gov. Wes Moore and leaders in the Maryland General Assembly were the top beneficiaries of the corporate largesse. Sam Janesch/The Baltimore Sun.

 MARYLAND LAWMAKERS HAVE UNFRUITFUL ICE CENTER VISIT: Two weeks after they were turned away from the same site, Maryland lawmakers toured an Immigration and Customs Enforcement holding facility in Baltimore Wednesday — but said they left with more questions than answers. Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Reps. Sarah Elfreth and Kweisi Mfume said their tour of the ICE facility in Baltimore provided no opportunity to talk to detainees and few answers to questions they posed to their ICE handlers. Lauren Lifke/Maryland Matters.

 A CONSERVATIVE TAKE-OVER OF CALVERT SCHOOLS: Inside the Calvert County Public Schools boardroom in Prince Frederick, Jana Smith-Post banged her gavel to interrupt cheers from a packed audience. Some 20 people had just given emotional testimony condemning the all-white board’s decision to remove the district’s antiracism policy. Students of color make up about a third of this system’s student body. That policy, instituted in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, made those students feel safe, those at the meeting said. Kristen Griffith/The Baltimore Banner.

 FIRST MARINE TO BE SWORN IN AS NAVAL ACADEMY SUPER: The first Marine officer to serve as the U.S. Naval Academy superintendent will officially take over Friday, concluding an unusually short tenure for the first woman to hold the position. Lt. Gen. Michael Borgschulte will relieve Superintendent Vice Adm. Yvette Davids in an invitation-only change-of-command ceremony at the academy’s Dahlgren Hall in Annapolis.
