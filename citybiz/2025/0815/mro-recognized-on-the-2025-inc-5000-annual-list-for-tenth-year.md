# MRO Recognized on the 2025 Inc. 5000 Annual List for Tenth Year

MRO, the leading clinical data exchange company in healthcare, announced today it made the Inc. 5000 annual list of fastest-growing private companies in America for the 10th year. The list provides a data-driven snapshot of the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses.

 This year’s Inc. 5000 honorees have demonstrated exceptional growth while navigating economic uncertainty, inflationary pressure, and a fluctuating labor market.

 “Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” says Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm—they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”

 “Earning a place on the Inc. 5000 list for the tenth time is a true honor for MRO,” said Jason Brown, CEO of MRO. “This recognition reflects our continued growth, the expansion of our portfolio, and the exceptional value we provide to clients and partners. We’re grateful for our team’s dedication and achievements, which fuel our commitment to accelerating clinical data and driving the healthcare industry forward.”
