# Kaizen to Showcase Agentic AI Solutions as Sponsor of Ai4 2025 in Las Vegas

Kaizen Analytix, a leading provider of AI, data analytics and technology services and solutions, announced today that it will serve as an official sponsor of Ai4 2025, (Booth #200), North America’s largest artificial-intelligence industry event, taking place August 11-13, 2025 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.

 At this industry-leading conference, Kaizen will unveil a suite of select Agentic AI solutions purpose-built to transform enterprise decision-making across consumer, passenger travel, automotive, financial services, and other key sectors. Designed to help companies scale while solving critical business challenges, the offerings include AI agents for price optimization, anomaly detection, and unstructured data insights derivation. By combining a library of domain-specific intelligent agents with a bespoke orchestration layer that plugs seamlessly into an enterprise’s data and existing data-science applications, these solutions enable organizations to modernize decision-making and unlock greater value from their information—with speed, precision, and confidence—in a completely secure environment.

 “We’re entering a new era where AI agents don’t just analyze data—they act on it. At Kaizen, our Agentic AI services are engineered to drive autonomous decision-making with precision and accountability,” explained V. Kishore Neppalli, Ph.D., managing director of Emerging Technologies at Kaizen Analytix. “By synergizing generative AI reasoning with data and model operational frameworks, we’re empowering our clients to accelerate from insight to action, scaling with AI confidently and securely.”

 Debuting at Ai4: Kaizen Agentic AI ServicesAt the event, Kaizen can be found at Booth #200 demonstrating a trio of next-generation AI agents engineered to unlock decision-making at scale in a secure environment. These offerings include:

 * Pricing Agent that dynamically recommends optimal price in real time, enabling faster, revenue- and margin-boosting decisions.
* Anomaly Detection Agent that continuously scans for operational and financial irregularities—that often go undetected—before they escalate into costly issues. This agent not only identifies issues but also accurately quantifies their business impact and assesses risk severity. It can even proactively suggest recommended solutions to humans—or enact the changes autonomously.
* Unstructured Data Agent that extracts actionable intelligence from vast volumes of unstructured enterprise content, such as feeds, documents, and images. This ChatGPT-style assistant can be applied to both structured and unstructured data from any enterprise function, allowing users to generate insights on demand with natural language.

 The company also offers highly customized solutions built with specific client data in mind. “Our clients don’t just want AI—they want outcomes,” said Neppalli. “Kaizen’s Agentic AI empowers business leaders to accelerate decision processes, uncover opportunities in complex data environments, and respond proactively to change. It’s about enabling action at the speed of insight.”

 “Regardless of where you are on your AI journey—establishing your roadmap, evaluating use cases, building and deploying AI models, or scaling AI adoption across your enterprise—Kaizen is your transformation partner,” said Jeff Anderson, Kaizen’s chief growth officer and co-founder. “We help clients achieve scale and unlock real business value from AI with a pragmatic, data-driven approach that blends innovation, domain expertise, and speed.”

 To support the surge in Enterprise AI demand, Kaizen has expanded its Emerging Technologies team with the addition of AI Engineers who bring a rare blend of academic rigor and real-world experience—including AI experience at the world’s biggest brands. Paired with industry subject matter experts and a continuous improvement-based approach, Kaizen’s AI practice is poised to help the world’s largest enterprises achieve greater scale at significantly lower costs.
