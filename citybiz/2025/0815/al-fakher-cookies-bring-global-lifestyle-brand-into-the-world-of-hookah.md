# Al Fakher &amp; Cookies Bring Global Lifestyle Brand into the World of Hookah

Five new shisha flavors. 2 legendary brands. 100% culture.

 Al Fakher, the world’s #1 hookah brand, has officially partnered with Cookies, one of the largest and most influential lifestyle brands in the world, to launch a first-of-its-kind flavor collection that bridges two powerhouse cultures.

 The Al Fakher x Cookies Collection marks Cookies’ debut in the global hookah category, delivering the brand’s unmistakable energy, style, and creative flavor approach in a tobacco-based format. This collaboration is 100% legal and designed for both seasoned hookah enthusiasts and newcomers alike.

 The collection features five bold, Cookies-inspired flavors:

 * Blueberry Caviar
* Citrus Zen
* Purple Sunset
* Sandia
* Lemon Icy

 “Cookies has built a global community by staying authentic and pushing boundaries,” said Berner, Co-Founder and CEO of Cookies. “Partnering with Al Fakher lets us bring that same energy into a whole new space— hookah.”

 Each flavor in the collection was developed in collaboration with Cookies’ flavor team and Al Fakher’s master blenders, ensuring a smooth, premium session that delivers on both brands’ reputations for quality. The drop also debuts a Cookies x Al Fakher co-branded packaging line, blending the instantly recognizable Cookies blue with Al Fakher’s iconic mark of quality.

 “This is more than a flavor launch, it’s a cultural crossover,” said Ashley Bock, Marketing Director at Al Fakher. “We’re bringing a massive lifestyle brand into a category they’ve never touched before, in a way that respects hookah tradition while expanding its reach.”

 The Al Fakher x Cookies Collection officially launched June 25, 2025, and is available now through select retailers and online partners.
