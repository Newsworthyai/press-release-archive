# Trump’s Cannabis Comments Stoke Altria Bet

Altria Group could be in line for a fresh source of growth if the Trump administration moves ahead with a long-anticipated change to federal cannabis rules. President Trump said Aug. 11 that cannabis reclassification is “under review” and a decision could come “in the next few weeks,” raising expectations the drug could be moved from the federal government’s strict Schedule I category to the less restrictive Schedule III. Such a change would lift tax burdens on cannabis companies and open the door to broader commercial activity without requiring new legislation from Congress.

 The Richmond, Va.-based cigarette maker has kept quiet on its cannabis strategy, but it has spent years laying groundwork to enter the market. Altria holds dozens of patents for vaporizer technology, including devices designed for THC and CBD. It has lobbied for legalization under a regulatory framework and owns a stake in Canadian cannabis firm Cronos Group. The company’s silence, analysts say, is as much about legal prudence as strategic secrecy.

 Reclassification would allow cannabis to be prescribed and researched under federal law, creating a pathway for Altria to sell inhalers, vaporizers, and other devices through national pharmacy chains. Analysts say Altria could also opt for lower-risk entry points—licensing its device technology, selling hardware to existing cannabis operators, or taking minority stakes—before fully committing to plant-touching operations.

 Even modest market penetration could prove lucrative. The U.S. cannabis market is projected to reach at least $46 billion by 2028. A 1% market share at a 15% net margin could add roughly $69 million in annual profit for Altria, equal to about $0.49 a share in value at current multiples. A more aggressive 2% share at 18% margins could generate $166 million, or $1.17 a share in potential uplift. Those figures are incremental relative to Altria’s $8.76 billion earnings base but could improve the company’s growth profile and valuation.

 The timing isn’t without risk. Even if the administration announces a decision this month, regulatory implementation could take months or years, leaving the market opportunity in limbo. And while cannabis could diversify revenue away from Altria’s shrinking cigarette business, management may weigh that against the risks of entering a still-fragmented, federally sensitive industry.

 For now, investors betting on a pivot see the prospect of cannabis as a call option embedded in Altria’s stock. Shares trade at about $65.50, with a forward price/earnings ratio of 11.9. A decisive move into the sector could give the company a high-margin growth leg at a time when its core tobacco volumes are under pressure—a shift some analysts say could be the most important strategic turn in its modern history.

 Key Points

 * Trump’s cannabis signal: President Trump said a decision on rescheduling cannabis could come “in the next few weeks,” raising expectations for a move from Schedule I to Schedule III without requiring congressional action.
* Altria’s quiet readiness: The company holds vaporizer patents, has lobbied for legalization, and owns a stake in cannabis firm Cronos Group—indicating preparation for rapid market entry.
* Market pathway: Reclassification would enable federally legal research, prescription use, and nationwide pharmacy distribution of cannabis-based products.
* Earnings potential: Even modest penetration—1% market share at 15% margins—could add ~$69M in profit; an aggressive 2% share at 18% margins could add ~$166M, boosting per-share value by up to $1.17.
* Risks remain: Implementation could take months or years, and management may weigh cannabis risks against the stability of Altria’s existing $8.76B earnings base.
