# D1 Training, Premier Athletic Fitness Brand Expands to Winchester

D1 Training, a leading fitness enrichment concept utilizing the five core tenets of athletic-based training, recently opened its first Winchester location at 178 Costello Dr. The new group fitness facility employs a sports-science backed training regimen led by certified trainers to help people of all ages achieve their sport and fitness goals.

 D1 Training has an impressive roster of existing franchisees, including professional athletes like Kylie Fitts and Jordan Gay. Additional franchise partners include notable figures such as Super Bowl MVP Von Miller, Tim Tebow, and Michael Oher.

 The new location is focused on making a positive, lasting impact on Winchester youth athletes and their families. With coaches who competed at the Division I level in baseball, soccer, football, and track, D1 Winchester brings a wide range of experience to help both youth and adults achieve their fitness and sports goals—no matter how big or small. While improving on-field performance is a core focus, D1 Winchester also prides itself on building the confidence and perseverance young athletes need to succeed both on and off the field. The team understands firsthand the value of competition and group sports in shaping strong leaders, teaching discipline, and helping athletes learn how to work together to bring out the best in one another.

 “We’re creating a space where kids feel supported, challenged, and inspired every time they walk through the doors,” said General Manager Kiersten Nogueira. “At D1 Winchester, our goal is to help young athletes grow not just in their sport, but as confident individuals who carry those lessons into school, relationships, and life beyond the field.”

 D1 Training offers four age-based programs including Rookie (ages 7-11), Developmental (ages 12-14), Prep (ages 15-18) and D1 Adult. Each fitness program is based on the five athletic-based tenets: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down. Outside of group workouts, D1 Training offers group, semi-private, and one-on-one training with world-class coaches. The goal is simple: to continue to train athletes who are dedicated to their sport or fitness goals, regardless of age, or athletic background.

 Strategically expanding across the nation through franchising, D1 Training has more than 100 performance centers open with over 100 additional locations in various stages of development. The brand is currently seeking financially qualified business builders, former athletes, and entrepreneurs, who share a passion for fitness and youth sports, who are ready to make a positive impact on their community.
