# DAUM Commercial Helps Leading Off-Road Racing Tire and Wheel Company Secure New 104,667 Square-Foot Headquarters Location in Los Angeles County

DAUM Commercial Real Estate Services, a leading provider of commercial real estate services including brokerage, tenant representation, consulting, leasing, sales, and property management, has secured a 94-month, $18.79 million lease of a 104,667 square-foot industrial building in Santa Fe Springs, California on behalf of a leading manufacturer and distributor of off-road racing tires and wheels.

 The facility, part of the recently developed three-building premier industrial complex Rexford Pioneer Logistics Center, will serve as the company’s new headquarters location, according to Chuck Brill, Executive Vice President, Principal, and South Bay Branch Manager at DAUM Commercial.

 “The tenant is in an expansion phase and needed a larger, high-quality headquarters location to facilitate its growing operations,” explains Brill. “The company is excited to occupy this new Class A distribution facility in Los Angeles County. This location is in close proximity to its existing operations, keeping the firm positioned among key partners and client bases.”

 Brill adds that through evaluating many competing properties in the market and putting out multiple offers, DAUM was able to ultimately negotiate and secure a competitive lease rate for this new construction.

 “Businesses that are willing to make real estate moves now are able to lock in Class A product at prices well below what they were two to three years ago,” says Brill. “However, there has been substantial absorption in recent months for quality Class A space. Thus, rates are steadily increasing from where they were just 6 months ago.”

 Brill notes that the broker-friendly team at Rexford, headed by Danielle Bray, Vice President, Leasing, helped the deal progress smoothly.

 “The leasing, marketing, and construction/development team at Rexford is second to none, bringing the deal to fruition quickly with their ‘can-do attitude,’” continues Brill. “Even after the lease had been executed, their attention to detail has kept tenant improvements ahead of schedule.”

 Brill adds: “This property’s location with immediate access to the I-605 and I-5 and less than 20 miles from the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, as well as its state-of-the-art features, will benefit the tenant’s business operations in the long term.”

 The property’s sustainable features include an air exchange system that lowers indoor temperatures and improves air quality; high-volume, low-speed fans; a water-efficient landscaping and irrigation system; thermoplastic polyolefin reflective roof; an all-concrete truck court; and nine EV charging stalls.

 The building also includes Class A, two-story office space; 32’ warehouse clearance height; ESFR sprinklers; 1,800-amp, expandable to 3,000-amp, capacity; 11 dock-high positions; two ground-level positions; a large, fenced yard; and a 139’ truck court.

 Brill, a seasoned veteran in the Los Angeles industrial real estate arena, has been an advocate for his client’s real estate needs for almost 40 years, negotiating complex real estate transactions for many name brand firms, and sophisticated real estate investors: “The bigger the challenge, the more I enjoy solving the problem.”

 The building is located at 10000 Pioneer Boulevard in Santa Fe Springs, California.
