# French Florist Opens First Midwest Location

What: French Florist, the best-in-class boutique creating vibrant handcrafted flower arrangements is celebrating the opening of its first location in Indianapolis, Indiana

 When: Wednesday, November 12th 10:00 a.m. – 6:00 p.m.

 Who: The new location is locally owned and operated by Joe Viater and Kadi

 Miller – two Indiana natives whose friendship and entrepreneurial drive led them to bring French Florist’s elegance to Indiana.

 Before joining French Florist, Kadi Miller worked as an art teacher, a role that allowed her to share creativity and self-expression with her students. Her artistic eye has since carried over into her floral work, where she has years of experience blending color, texture, and design to craft arrangements.

 Joe Viater brings a sharp entrepreneurial and corporate background to the partnership. A Purdue University graduate and Stanford MBA, Viater first established a strong career at Eli Lilly before launching a biotech hedge fund and subsequently leading a private equity backed software company. After years in the corporate world, he felt drawn to a venture that was more personal and community oriented.

 The two business partners’ paths crossed years ago through Viater’s wife, Mollie, who has been close friends with Miller since middle school. When the opportunity to bring French Florist to Indiana emerged, the two saw it as the perfect collaboration: Miller’s floral artistry and community ties paired with Viater’s business acumen and growth mindset.

 Location: French Florist
