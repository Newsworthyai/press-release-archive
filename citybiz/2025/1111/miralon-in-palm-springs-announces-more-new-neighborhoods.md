# Miralon in Palm Springs Announces More New Neighborhoods

Freehold Communities®, one of the nation’s most vibrant and forward-looking developers of residential communities, has announced that PLC Communities has opened models on October 4 at Miralon in Palm Springs. PLC’s neighborhood (named Olea) will have 71 single family homes. PLC will also build a neighborhood of 157 paired homes (named Lily) starting next year, bringing the number of residences the Newport Beach-based company will create at Miralon to 228. These neighborhoods join Solace, the new neighborhood of 25 homes that Woodbridge Pacific Group is constructing, with presales starting in November of this year.

 Miralon is Palm Springs’ award-winning, eco-Modern, “agrihood” community, distinguished by community gardens, working olive groves and chic club facilities, all fashioned from a former golf course.

 “We are excited that PLC Communities will build both Olea and Lily at Miralon,” said Brad Shuckhart, Freehold Communities, California Division President. “The 157 new paired homes will bring even more choices for buyers to enjoy stunning desert Modern homes among Miralon’s rich mix of amenities that are unequaled in Palm Springs.”

 The 71 single-family homes of Olea start at approximately $1.1 million. The 157 paired homes of Lily will offer two to four bedrooms. Prices at Lily are expected to start in the $700,000s.

 The 25 homes of Solace by Woodbridge Pacific Group will start preselling late 2025.

 Miralon’s builder activity demonstrates the continued success of its approach: Homes that honor Palm Springs’ Modern architectural heritage, in a sustainable masterplan with neighborhood gardens, olive groves and enticing club and other amenities forming a strong sense of community.

 “With the addition of Lily by PLC Communities, Miralon continues evolving as Palm Springs and the Coachella Valley’s premiere desert community for a wide choice of homes among stylish amenities and incredible views,” added Shuckhart.

 Freehold Communities is the developer of Miralon, one of the largest new “agrihoods” in the U.S. The masterplan will include 1,150 Modernist-inspired residences to harmonize with Palm Springs’ architectural heritage. A highlight of Miralon’s 309 acres is its conversion of a previously constructed 18-hole golf course into the working olive groves, U-pick gardens and walking trails. The Miralon Club is a private facility with two pools, a hot tub, a full-service bar, demonstration kitchen, yoga and fitness studio and Wi-Fi Café. Together, these amenities fulfill Freehold’s Vital Communities® approach toward healthy living and social engagement.
