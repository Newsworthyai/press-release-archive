 Since first partnering in 2017, MileOne Autogroup and VFC have awarded more than 230 vehicles, valued at over $1.5 million, to individuals and families working to overcome transportation barriers. The partnership also supports VFC’s Full Circle Auto Training Program, which provides reentry and workforce development opportunities for justice-involved and underemployed individuals.

 Through MileOneCares, MileOne Autogroup’s corporate giving initiative, the company invests in programs that expand access to transportation and create long-term community impact across the Mid-Atlantic.

 In addition to Whiteaker, other veteran recipients who left with their own vehicle included:

 * Cory Mussenden (Baltimore County), an Army veteran and father of five whose new vehicle will allow his family to travel safely and spend more time together;
* Sylvester Palmer (Anne Arundel County), an Army veteran and caseworker who currently commutes six hours a day to help others; this vehicle reduces that to just 20 minutes, giving him more time with family and community;
* Eugene Anthony (Cecil County), an Army veteran and father of four who will gain independence and stability after years of relying on public transit;
* Byron Branch (Baltimore City), a Navy veteran receiving the chance to secure stable employment and rebuild vital family connections across state lines;
* and Xavier Travers (Cecil County), a Navy veteran who sees this vehicle as the final step toward rebuilding his life after overcoming homelessness and securing stable housing. This car will allow him to visit his family more often.

 The event took place at Heritage Toyota Owings Mills, 9801 Reisterstown Road, Owings Mills, MD 21117.
