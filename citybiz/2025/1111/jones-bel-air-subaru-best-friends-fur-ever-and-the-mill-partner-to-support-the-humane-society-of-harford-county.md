# Jones Bel Air Subaru, Best Friends Fur Ever, and The Mill Partner to Support the Humane Society of Harford County

Best Friends Fur Ever (BFFE), Baltimore’s premier dog care provider, joined forces with Jones Bel Air Subaru and The Mill to collaborate throughout October for the “Fill a Forester” campaign, benefiting the Humane Society of Harford County.

 The month-long initiative encouraged donations of pet food, toys, cleaning supplies, and other essentials to support local animals in need. The results were extraordinary: two Subaru Foresters completely filled with donations, and an additional two full pallets—nearly 3,000 pounds—of dog food donated by The Mill. These contributions will help feed and care for shelter animals as well as pets in the community who rely on the Humane Society’s Pet Food Pantry.

 “These donations go beyond meeting a need—they represent compassion in action,” said Amanda Hickman, Executive Director of the Humane Society of Harford County. “This level of community support ensures that animals in our care, and the families who love them, won’t go without.”

 The Jones Junction family of dealerships has been a cornerstone of the Harford County business community for more than 108 years. With the establishment of Jones Bel Air Subaru, the company has continued to build on its longstanding legacy of service through initiatives such as Subaru Loves Pets, a national program launched in 2016 to promote animal welfare and adoption across the country.

 “Supporting animal welfare is part of Subaru’s DNA,” said Anthony Barkas, General Manager of Jones Bel Air Subaru. “Through partnerships like this, we can extend that impact locally and make a tangible difference in the lives of animals and their caretakers.”

 For Best Friends Fur Ever, a company devoted to creating enriching, safe environments for dogs, the partnership was a natural fit. Their customers and staff share Subaru’s deep appreciation for animals and community involvement.

 “At Best Friends Fur Ever, we don’t just believe every dog deserves the best day ever—we work every day to make it happen,” said Mary Steinebrunner, President of Best Friends Fur Ever. “Thanks to our partnership with Jones Bel Air Subaru and The Mill, that spirit of care reached far beyond our doors and into the hearts of pets and families across Harford County.”

 

 The Mill is a family-owned and operated business deeply rooted in farm, home, pet, garden, lawn, and wild bird care. Founded in 1957 as Reckord Mill, it was later renamed Bel Air Farm Supply by H. Smith Walter. In 1986, Walter’s grandson, Henry Holloway, took ownership, and today he and his wife, along with three of their four children, proudly operate eight agricultural retail locations across Maryland. The Mill remains dedicated to supporting local communities through quality products, education, and meaningful partnerships that enhance life for people and their pets.

 The success of this campaign underscores what can be achieved when local businesses unite behind a shared mission. Through the collective generosity of customers, staff, and partners, thousands of pounds of food and supplies will help sustain pets across Harford County. Jones Bel Air Subaru, Best Friends Fur Ever, and The Mill extend their sincere gratitude to everyone who contributed to the Fill a Forester campaign.
