I look forward to partnering with our franchisees and company-owned store teams to deliver superior performance.”

Known for his people-first leadership style, strategic mindset, and commitment to operational excellence, he will partner closely with the FullSpeed Automotive leadership team to drive growth, enhance franchisee collaboration, and deliver exceptional customer experiences systemwide.

 FullSpeed Automotive is a portfolio company of MidOcean Partners, a leading private equity firm focused on high-quality, middle-market companies.

We are confident Brian will continue unifying company-owned and franchise operations, elevate customer service consistency, and build on the rich heritage of our iconic brands to make them the most trusted names in automotive care.”
