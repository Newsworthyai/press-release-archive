# Ann’s Choice Honors Veterans with “Hometown Heroes” Banners in November

In celebration of Veterans Day, Ann’s Choice, an Erickson Senior Living-managed community in Bucks County, Pa., is proudly displaying 82 “Hometown Heroes” banners throughout its campus in November.

 The banners honor residents and team members who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces, recognizing their dedication, sacrifice, and service to the nation.

 This special initiative was organized by the community’s Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB) committee and made possible through a DEIB grant from National Senior Communities. Each banner features the veteran’s name, photo, and branch of service, creating a powerful visual tribute.

 “This project is a heartfelt way to honor the men and women among us who answered the call to service,” said Executive Director Chris Donati. “Seeing the faces of our resident and staff veterans displayed across campus is a daily reminder of their courage and commitment.”

As new residents and team members with military backgrounds join the community, additional banners will be created to ensure that every veteran is recognized and remembered.
