 “Over the past 20 years, Bart has provided tremendous business leadership. During his close to 10-year tenure as President, Reinforcement Materials Segment, he has been instrumental in delivering that Segment’s strong financial performance, driving operational excellence at our manufacturing plants, and further strengthening our leadership position as an important supplier to the tire industry. He also played a key role in developing our EVOLVE® Sustainable Solutions technology platform,” said Sean Keohane, president and chief executive officer of Cabot Corporation. “His business knowledge and commercial expertise have been critical to our success. On behalf of the Company, I would like to thank Bart for his many years of service and know that his significant contributions will have a lasting positive effect on Cabot.”

 Wood joined Cabot from BP, plc in 2010, and, prior to his current role, has held a variety of regional and global commercial, marketing and strategy, operational and general management roles with increasing responsibility within Cabot’s Reinforcement Materials, Specialty Compounds, and former cesium formate businesses. Matt brings significant business experience within the Reinforcement Materials segment, having previously served as vice president of global marketing and Asia Pacific regional marketing director. In his current role as vice president, global marketing and strategy for the Company’s Battery Materials product line, he has been instrumental in developing and driving the business’s growth strategy.

 

Keohane added, “Matt brings a well-rounded background to his new role, with deep commercial and strategy expertise, hands-on operational leadership, and a proven track record as a disciplined and decisive business leader. He is also one of our most global executives, having worked for Cabot in Europe, the United States, and Asia. I have developed a strong appreciation for his business acumen and strategic insight, and as a member of our corporate leadership team, he has demonstrated a passion for leading teams and developing talent and is recognized as a strong and highly respected leader across the Company.
