# InterMedia Group of Companies Appoints David Nyurenberg as Vice President – Digital

IMGC today announced the appointment of David Nyurenberg as Senior Vice President, Digital, marking a significant expansion of the agency’s leadership in Connected TV, programmatic advertising, and AI-powered media strategy. This strategic hire positions IMGC to lead the next wave of innovation in both traditional linear and streaming media, ensuring brands have a performance-first partner at the forefront of the industry’s transformation.

 As CTV advertising spend is projected to surpass $40 billion in 2025, advertisers face mounting challenges around fragmentation, signal loss, and performance measurement. Nyurenberg’s appointment comes at a pivotal moment, bringing deep technical expertise, visionary leadership, and a bold mandate to modernize IMGC’s media buying and analytics operations through advanced AI integration.

 Leading the AI Transformation of TV Media

 In his new role, Nyurenberg will spearhead InterMedia’s effort to unify linear and digital media strategy through the implementation of an agency-wide AI orchestration layer. This initiative aims to modernize legacy TV planning, buying, and measurement processes by integrating machine learning and automation across every client touchpoint, from upfront buying to real-time performance optimization.

 Nyurenberg brings a wealth of experience from across the advertising ecosystem, with a track record of helping Fortune 500 brands scale streaming campaigns, deploy machine learning for media buying, and improve measurement accountability. He previously served as Director of Digital Video Product and Innovation at Rain the Growth Agency and was the founder of Valor Digital, where he built data solutions for leading global marketers including Reckitt Benckiser, WPP, and Edelman.

 “David’s appointment signals a bold new chapter for InterMedia,” said Robert Yallen, CEO at IMGC. “His understanding of both linear and digital media, paired with a clear vision for how AI can transform our operations, will help our clients navigate a rapidly evolving landscape. We’re excited for the value his leadership will bring.”

 

A Recognized Industry Voice

 Nyurenberg is a respected voice in the digital advertising community, regularly featured in publications such as Adweek, Digiday, and AdExchanger, and is a frequent speaker at industry conferences. His thought leadership on CTV, AI in media, and programmatic innovation continues to shape industry best practices and push for greater transparency and accountability.

 “I’m thrilled to join an agency with over 50 years of trust and reputation at a time when the entire media ecosystem is undergoing profound change,” said Nyurenberg. “My focus will be on building the tools, systems, and strategies that ensure InterMedia leads, not follows, the next chapter of TV advertising. This is about empowering our clients with the intelligence and agility they need to outperform in a world where data, creativity, and AI must work hand in hand.”

 Nyurenberg’s arrival represents more than a new hire, it’s a signal to the market that IMGC is serious about leading the convergence of TV and technology, and redefining what it means to be a media agency in the modern era.
