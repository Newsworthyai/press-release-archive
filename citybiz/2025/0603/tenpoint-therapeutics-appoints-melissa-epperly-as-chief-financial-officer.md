LONDON & SEATTLE–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Tenpoint Therapeutics, a global, clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing groundbreaking treatments to rejuvenate vision in the aging eye, today announced the appointment of Melissa Epperly as Chief Financial Officer (CFO). In this role, Epperly will oversee Tenpoint’s financial strategy, capital markets activities, and operational finance functions as the company prepares for the potential U.S. launch of BRIMOCHOL PF, its lead candidate for the treatment of presbyopia.

 Epperly brings over two decades of financial leadership experience in the biopharmaceutical industry, having served as CFO for both public and private companies. Most recently, she was CFO at Zentalis Pharmaceuticals, where she led the company through a successful IPO and subsequent financings, raising over $1.25 billion. Her prior roles include CFO positions at PsiOxus Therapeutics and R-Pharm US, as well as strategic and financial roles at Anchorage Capital, Goldman Sachs, Bain & Company, and Morgan Stanley.

 “Melissa brings the vision, energy, and financial firepower we need as we prepare for the launch of BRIMOCHOL PF into global markets,” said Henric Bjarke, Chief Executive Officer of Tenpoint Therapeutics. “Her deep capital markets experience and strong operational command will be a tremendous asset as Tenpoint grows into a commercial-stage company.”

She holds an MBA from Harvard Business School and a BA in Biochemistry and Economics from the University of Virginia, where she graduated Phi Beta Kappa.
