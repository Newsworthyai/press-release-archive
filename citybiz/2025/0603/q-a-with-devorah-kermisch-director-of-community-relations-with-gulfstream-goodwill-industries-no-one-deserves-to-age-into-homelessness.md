 What is Gulfstream Goodwill Industries?

 When most people hear the name “Goodwill,” they picture the retail stores. But Gulfstream Goodwill Industries (GGI) is much more than that. We are the largest provider of homeless services across five counties: Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie, Indian River, and Okeechobee. In Palm Beach County alone, we operate four shelters and provide over 150 units of temporary and permanent housing. Each year, nearly 100,000 nights of safe shelter are offered to individuals and families in crisis. Most recently, we began running a program to secure meals for the shelters though corporate sponsors and individual donors.

 Is the number of older adults experiencing homelessness increasing?

 It’s a heartbreaking trend that is emerging. Over the past year, we’ve seen a troubling increase in seniors as men and women in their 70s, 80s, and even 90s are seeking emergency shelter. These are not strangers. They are our parents, grandparents, former teachers, veterans, and neighbors. They have worked, raised families, contributed to their communities and now, in the final chapters of their lives, they find themselves on the street, without safe shelter, without food and nowhere to lay their heads at night. This is not just sad… it’s unacceptable.

 What’s causing this troubling trend?

 From 2017 to 2022, the number of seniors experiencing homelessness grew by a staggering 65%. Several interconnected challenges are fueling this crisis.

 One of those reasons is the severe affordable housing shortage. In fact, there has been a 36.7% price increase in one-bedroom apartment rents since 2021 that has priced out many seniors living on fixed incomes. Seniors are also dealing with inadequate financial support as Florida’s maximum Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit is $637 per month which is far below what is needed to afford even basic housing. Plus, there are serious healthcare and mobility barriers, as many seniors face chronic health conditions and lack access to affordable care and transportation, making it nearly impossible to maintain stable housing.

 Is anything being done locally to help?

 Yes, in response, Palm Beach County has implemented several important initiatives. In 2024, the Division of Senior and Veteran Services provided over $106,000 in aid to 22 older adults at risk of losing their homes. A new 74-bed housing center and 17 cottage homes were developed to offer more permanent housing solutions. And they expanded medical respite care and eviction prevention services that are helping address some of the critical needs.

 While these are important steps, they are not enough.

 How is Gulfstream Goodwill helping?

 To address this growing crisis, Gulfstream Goodwill has launched Out and About program. This includes our Senior Homeless Prevention Services, which is a mobile outreach initiative that brings essential resources directly to where seniors live. The program offers emergency food, hosts mobile farmers markets, and connects seniors with vital financial, health, and wellness services to help them stay safely housed and independent.

 We are also actively working to expand our affordable housing efforts, because aging should come with dignity, not despair. No one deserves to age into homelessness. Every senior deserves a safe, stable place to call home.

 How can people help?

 If you or someone you know would like us to visit your senior community, please reach out. Call us at 561-273-4200 or email seniorsupport@goggi.org to learn more about our services or schedule a visit with a case worker.
