# Qlik Appoints Brian Hamel as Chief Revenue Officer

PHILADELPHIA–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Qlik, a global leader in data integration, data quality, analytics, and artificial intelligence, today announced the appointment of Brian Hamel as Chief Revenue Officer, joining at a pivotal moment as enterprises shift from AI experimentation to real-world impact. Hamel will lead Qlik’s global sales organization to meet surging demand for enterprise-ready solutions that turn data and AI into trusted, timely decisions. His arrival accelerates Qlik’s next phase of growth, building on its position as the independent leader in delivering trusted, scalable data-to-decision execution.

 Hamel brings more than 25 years of leadership experience from enterprise technology companies including IBM, Lenovo, Oracle, and most recently Veritas, where he led global sales transformation and accelerated the company’s shift to cloud and subscription models. Throughout his career, he has built and scaled high-performing commercial organizations, modernized go-to-market operations, and driven sustained growth through major market transitions. His track record in aligning sales strategy with customer needs—especially during moments of platform and technology disruption—positions him well to lead Qlik’s global expansion in the era of enterprise AI.

 “Brian’s appointment marks a pivotal next step in Qlik’s growth story,” said Mike Capone, CEO of Qlik. “His experience scaling global go-to-market organizations and leading through major industry shifts makes him the right leader to help us capture the full opportunity in front of us. As enterprises race to turn data and AI into better decisions, Brian will play a critical role in expanding our customer impact and accelerating our global reach.”

 

“I’m thrilled to join Qlik at this defining time,” said Hamel. “Enterprises are under real pressure to move faster and make smarter decisions with their data—and Qlik has the platform and momentum to help them do it. My focus from day one will be listening to our teams, engaging with customers and partners, and building on the strong foundation already in place. I believe great outcomes come from aligned teams who believe in the mission—and Qlik has that.”

 Hamel’s appointment builds on a milestone year for Qlik, marked by record growth in SaaS annual recurring revenue and the launch of two major innovations—Qlik’s agentic AI experience and Qlik Open Lakehouse—unveiled last month at Qlik Connect. These launches reflect Qlik’s continued leadership in delivering practical, scalable, and cost-efficient AI across the enterprise. As organizations look to embed AI into real workflows and decisions, demand is accelerating for solutions that sit at the center of enterprise strategy—spanning data integration, governance, analytics, and AI.

 In his new role, Hamel will lead efforts to expand Qlik’s global partner ecosystem, deepen strategic alliances, and strengthen the company’s go-to-market execution—ensuring Qlik can meet customer needs with greater speed, specialization, and scale. These priorities are central to helping some of the world’s largest brands in complex, high-stakes industries leverage Qlik’s platform and AI capabilities to gain a strategic edge, as Qlik continues defining the standard for enterprise AI execution.
