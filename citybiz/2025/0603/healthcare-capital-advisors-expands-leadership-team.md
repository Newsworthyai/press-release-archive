# Healthcare Capital Advisors Expands Leadership Team

Healthcare Capital Advisors, a leading investment bank and strategic advisory firm focused exclusively on the behavioral health sector, is proud to announce the launch of its dedicated consulting practice, led by behavioral healthcare executive Lisa Richardson, MS / LCDC III.

 Lisa joins HCA as the Managing Director of Consulting following a remarkable 15-year career in healthcare leadership. Her last venture was as the founder and CEO of Beyond Healthcare, where she scaled a multi-site adolescent PHP/IOP program and raised millions in funding. She has launched and scaled multiple behavioral health programs across every level of care and is a sought-after speaker on leading values-based organizations with strong workplace cultures. Her operational expertise, combined with deep experience in launching and scaling behavioral health programs, makes her a vital addition to HCA’s mission to support providers through every stage of growth and transition.

 Lisa will lead an expert team that includes:

 * Leah Hendricks, M.Ed / LPCC-S, former Corporate Director of Business Development and Admissions at Beyond Healthcare, known for her strengths in strategic outreach, admissions optimization, and building high-performing growth teams in a trauma-informed manner.
* Teresa McClure, MS / LPC / ACADC, former VP of Startup Operations at Northpoint Recovery, who brings extensive expertise in launching and scaling large high-end de novo addiction and mental health facilities and ensuring all compliance, regulatory and expansion plans are led with excellence.
* Dr. Michele Maloney, PhD / LPC, current Executive Director at Rogers Behavioral Health, who brings over 20 years’ experience in executive Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder treatment. She brings a wealth of experience regarding best practices, program design, clinical design, and medication-assisted treatment modalities.
* Erin Kennedy, BA, who was responsible for leading all revenue cycle management activities at Banyan Treatment Center from startup to her recent exit, lead the organization with exceptional organization and leadership as the Chief Revenue Officer. She is an expert in all billing practices, building compliant and efficient teams, and scaling operations quickly to align with clinical needs.
* Michele Santagata, BA, Michele brings more than 15 years of expertise in optimizing contact center operations for multisite healthcare organizations. She specializes in helping behavioral health companies improve conversion rates while reducing operational costs through strategic process improvements and technology integration. Michele works with healthcare organizations to implement efficient workflows and Salesforce solutions that enhance patient experience and operational performance.
* Jessica Molina, MA, is a skilled executive educator with a heart for helping complex systems to find solutions that are culturally relevant, trauma-informed and solution-focused. Jessica is a strategist that brings people together to reduce silos, build trust, and get real results.
* Two additional behavioral healthcare executives will be announced later this quarter to round out the expertise of this exceptional team with Human Resources and Communication expertise.

 

Together, this team will offer Fractional Executive Services (including CEO, CMO, CFO, COO, etc.), Startup and Turnaround Strategy, Sale Preparation, and Operational Consulting to behavioral healthcare organizations and investors.

 “At HCA, we’re known for helping great behavioral health businesses grow, evolve, and transition successfully. With Lisa at the helm of our consulting practice, our clients gain an invaluable partner who knows what it takes to build programs that thrive in today’s market,” said Jacob Lynch, Managing Director at Healthcare Capital Advisors. “Her expertise, along with this exceptional executive team, adds real-world insight that will be a value-add for every organization we serve.”

 Lisa further commented, “Our consulting practice is built upon the belief that companies should have access to a well-rounded team of true experts to help scale or sustain their organization for the long haul. When building an organization, sometimes you need outside help that can solve problems or implement solutions more efficiently than you could with in-house staff. I have personally worked alongside each of these women and know they are exceptional at what they do, have a heart for people, and get real results. They have been the backbone of many incredible organizations throughout the industry, and I’m excited to see what we can accomplish together and under the incredible leadership of Jacob Lynch.”

 The consulting team is proud to donate a portion of its profits to Futures without Violence, the National Organization for Victim Advocacy, The Child Mind Institute, and No Kid Hungry. These organizations are close to the heart of our leaders.
