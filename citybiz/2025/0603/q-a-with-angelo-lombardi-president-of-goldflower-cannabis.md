# Q&amp;A with Angelo Lombardi, President of Goldflower Cannabis

Goldflower Cannabis, the cannabis brand renowned for its premium, organically cultivated cannabis products, is proud to announce the opening of its seventh Florida dispensary, on Saturday, 6/14 @ 7401 Bird Road, Miami. This expansion marks a significant milestone in Goldflower’s rapid statewide growth, reflecting its commitment to providing high-quality, clean cannabis to medical patients across Florida.

 Since its inception, Goldflower has evolved into a vertically integrated operation, overseeing every aspect from genetics and cultivation to extraction and retail. Their flagship brand, Ideal Cannabis, epitomizes their ethos, offering products crafted with solventless extracted cannabis oil and grown using organic practices. Goldflower is also licensed to sell Lion Order products, created with superstars such as Ray Lewis of the Ravens, Mike James of the Bucs and Lions, Rohan Marley, and Michael Phelps, and the Miami location will feature the state’s largest selection of Lion Order offerings.

 The new Miami location not only broadens Goldflower’s footprint but also brings their luxurious retail experience and exceptional customer service to a vibrant, diverse community. As Goldflower continues its mission to redefine the medical cannabis experience in Florida, this opening signifies a step forward in making premium cannabis accessible to more patients.

 With the upcoming opening of Goldflower’s seventh Florida location in Miami, what factors influenced the decision to expand into this particular market, and how does it align with your overall growth strategy?

 Miami is arguably the most vibrant and dynamic city in Florida—and quite possibly in the entire U.S. It’s a cultural capital, home to world-class art, sports, nightlife, and a diverse, engaged population. For us, launching our Miami store is not just about adding another location—it’s about planting our flag in a city that aligns with our vision for community, culture, and excellence. Several of our most exciting brand partners, including Ricky Williams with the brand 34, and Rohan Marley with Lion Order, have deep roots in Miami. This store will be our flagship location and a hub where these brand partners can see their creations come to life in an environment that reflects their ethos. Strategically, it places us in a high-density, high-traffic corridor near Coconut Grove and Coral Gables, allowing us to serve residents where they live, work, and play—an essential approach in Florida’s medical-only market.

 You mentioned Goldflower offers products like Ideal Cannabis and collaborations with cultural icons such as Method Man and Ricky Williams. How do these unique offerings set Goldflower apart in Florida’s competitive cannabis market?

 What sets Goldflower apart is not only our premium product quality but the cultural depth and authenticity behind the brands we carry. Ideal Cannabis represents the pinnacle of cultivation—30+ years of expertise from Oregonians who grow in living soil and use only solventless extraction methods. That level of integrity and purity is unmatched. On the other hand, our exclusive partnerships with cultural icons like Ricky Williams, Method Man, Rohan Marley, and Randy Lanier bring authenticity, storytelling, and genuine community engagement to our shelves. These aren’t celebrity endorsements—they are real creators behind real brands who have been advocating on behalf of cannabis for decades and the reason THEY chose Goldflower rather than much larger competitors is due to our comparable to organic growing practices, unique genetics, and incredible flavor and effect of our products. This dual focus on quality and culture is why our partners chose us and why patients across Florida choose Goldflower.

 

 Goldflower emphasizes a “white-glove service” and boutique aesthetic in its stores. How do you ensure this level of customer experience across multiple locations, and what training or standards are in place for staff?

 We believe that cannabis patients deserve respect, compassion, and a beautiful, welcoming environment. Every Goldflower store is thoughtfully designed with premium materials like wood and stone to reflect warmth and integrity. But our true differentiation comes from our people. We invest heavily in training our budtenders, ensuring they have deep product knowledge and a strong understanding of the endocannabinoid system. Every store includes private consultation rooms so patients can have real conversations about their needs—whether they’re seeking relief from pain, support with sleep, or help with appetite. We also host Meet the Grower and Meet the Maker events to keep our staff and customers educated and engaged. Consistency in service is a core value, and it starts with deep respect for the medicine and the people who use it.

 Florida has a unique regulatory landscape for medical cannabis. What have been the biggest hurdles in navigating compliance across multiple cities, and how do you stay ahead of evolving legislation?

 Florida’s medical cannabis framework is evolving, and with that comes both opportunity and responsibility. One of the biggest challenges is ensuring that both the State’s and each municipality’s regulations are met while maintaining a consistent Goldflower experience statewide. We have a very senior and large compliance team that works closely with legal advisors, regulators, and medical professionals to ensure every aspect of our operations meets or exceeds state standards. We also maintain open lines of communication with qualified cannabis doctors to align on patient care. Our focus on education—both internally and within the community—helps us adapt quickly and responsibly as the landscape shifts.

 Are there any innovations Goldflower is investing in—whether in cultivation, retail tech, or customer experience—that you’re particularly excited about in the coming year?

 Absolutely. We’re continuing to invest in solventless extraction technologies through our Ideal brand partners, as we believe it’s the safest, cleanest form of cannabis oil for patients. We are also constantly innovating our genetics to find what grows best in Florida while also appealing to customers from a flavor, quality, and effect perspective. Something very unique that we do is that when we do our pheno hunts (hunting for new genetics) we actually take the competing alternatives and offer them to patients who can then vote on which of those sub strains was their favorite. In this manner we involve the patients in not only innovation but choosing their own medicine. We’re also exploring in-store tech that streamlines product education and improves personalization. Beyond tech, we’re expanding our event programming—Meet the Grower, Meet the Maker, and Grand Openings—to create deeper community ties and learning opportunities. Miami will be a showcase for many of these innovations.

 Anything else to add?

 We are extremely focused on our mission to be the leading provider of the highest quality and safest cannabis products to Floridians in the most beautiful retails spaces and supported by an incredible customer experience while at the same time showing reverence for the plant, the patients, and our own people.
