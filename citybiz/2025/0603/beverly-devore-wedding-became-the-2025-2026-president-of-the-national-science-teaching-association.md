 “NSTA is honored to welcome Bev as our new president,” said NSTA Interim CEO Bob Lay. “Her exceptional track record in science education—and her leadership at both the state and national levels—reflect the values and vision at the heart of our organization. Bev has been a tireless advocate for inclusive, community-centered science education that truly reaches all learners. Her passion and dedication are inspiring, and we are excited to support her as she guides NSTA into its next chapter.”

 For more than 25 years, DeVore-Wedding taught high school and community college math and science in Colorado before becoming a science curriculum developer, chemistry instructor, and lab coordinator for Nebraska Indian Community College from 2014 to 2018. From 2019 to 2023, she spent her time educating teachers at Adams State University in Alamosa, Colorado, until she eventually returned to the Nebraska Indian Community College from August 2023 through May 2025, where she taught science remotely.

Among her certifications are Colorado Professional Teacher Licensure: Science and Math endorsements and a Wyoming Professional Teacher certification in biology, chemistry, earth science, and general science.

 “Thirty-five years ago, as a novice teacher in rural Colorado, NSTA played a pivotal role in shaping my journey. It provided resources, professional learning, and—most importantly—a community of passionate science educators who have since become my science family,” said DeVore-Wedding. “I’m deeply honored to give back to NSTA and its incredible members by serving as its president.”

 DeVore-Wedding has demonstrated a long-standing commitment to science education through a wide range of leadership and service roles. Her contributions span several key organizations, including the Colorado Association of Science Teachers, the Colorado Department of Education, the Colorado Science Educators Network Steering Committee, and the National Science Education Leadership Association. Within NSTA, she has held numerous influential positions, such as High School Division Director, District XIV Director, chair of both the Rural Science Advisory Board and The Science Teacher Advisory Board, and co-chair of the Awards Task Force, among several other committees.
