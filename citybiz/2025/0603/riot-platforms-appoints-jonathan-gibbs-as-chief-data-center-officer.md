# Riot Platforms Appoints Jonathan Gibbs as Chief Data Center Officer

CASTLE ROCK, Colo., June 2, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Riot Platforms,  a Bitcoin-driven industry leader in the development of large scale data centers for high performance compute and bitcoin mining applications, today announced the hiring of Jonathan Gibbs as Chief Data Center Officer (“CDCO”) to lead the development of Riot’s data center platform. In this role, Jonathan will lead the strategic development and operations of this new platform, which will focus on building and operating state-of-the-art data centers specifically tailored to serve hyperscale and enterprise tenants.

 The creation of this new data center platform furthers Riot’s strategy to maximize the value of its assets by expanding into the development of non-bitcoin-related data centers, which diversifies the Company’s revenues, enhances Riot’s ability to generate long-term cash returns for investors and strengthens its capabilities to contract with the world’s leading technology companies. This additional platform will build on the success of Riot’s vertically-integrated strategy of utilizing bitcoin mining at scale to create significant value across its land and power portfolio and positions the Company to capitalize on the upsurge in demand for digital infrastructure driven by the growing need for cloud computing, AI and other compute-intensive applications.

 “We are excited to bring Jonathan on as Chief Data Center Officer to lead our new platform,” said Jason Les, CEO of Riot. “Jonathan brings extensive expertise, strong industry relationships, and a proven track record of successfully developing data centers for hyperscale and enterprise tenants. Given the significant amount of immediately available capacity within our portfolio, we are looking forward to the opportunity to drive continued shareholder value creation as we focus on aggressively scaling data center development to meet the surging demand for high performance computing.”

 Jonathan brings over 15 years of experience designing and building large-scale, state-of-the-art data centers, delivering high-quality infrastructure for hyperscale and enterprise tenants. Jonathan has led the development of data centers totaling more than one gigawatt of capacity, with a portfolio spanning North America, Europe, and Asia. Over his career, Jonathan has overseen and contributed to infrastructure design, procurement, construction, and sustainability initiatives representing more than $17 billion in investment.  Most recently, he served as Executive Vice President of Product Delivery at Prime Data Centers, where he led the design, development and construction of data centers throughout the United States.

 “I’m incredibly excited to join Riot and lead this new platform which will leverage Riot’s unique development expertise and asset portfolio,” said Jonathan Gibbs, CDCO for Riot. “With a pipeline of over 1.7 gigawatts of power immediately available and in close proximity to major markets, Riot is uniquely positioned to develop data centers which will address the strong market demand.”
