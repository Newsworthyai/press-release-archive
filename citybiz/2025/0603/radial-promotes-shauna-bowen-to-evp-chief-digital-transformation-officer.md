# Radial Promotes Shauna Bowen to EVP, Chief Digital &amp; Transformation Officer

KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Radial, Inc., a bpostgroup company, the leader in eCommerce solutions, today announced the promotion of Shauna Bowen to Executive Vice President, Chief Digital & Transformation Officer. This move follows the planned retirement of Chief Technology Officer Jim French and marks a new chapter for Radial as the company continues to build on the success of its Radial Fast Track fulfillment solution, which has already been adopted by seven modern brands since its launch in March.

 Bowen, who previously served as SVP of Strategy & Transformation, will now oversee Technology, Product, and Transformation, three critical teams driving Radial’s next phase of digital innovation and client service.

 Outgoing CTO Jim French played a foundational role in strengthening Radial’s technology infrastructure, improving system reliability, and laying the groundwork for scalable transformation.

 “I’m proud of the strides we’ve made in building a more resilient, agile tech foundation,” said Jim French, retiring CTO, Radial. “Shauna was the natural choice to succeed me. Since joining Radial, she has brought a strategic, innovative approach and played a key role in the development and launch of Radial Fast Track. With her at the helm, I’m confident Radial is positioned to lead the next generation of fulfillment innovation.”

 Since launching in March, Radial Fast Track has quickly gained traction, enabling brands to scale rapidly without compromising delivery speed or service quality. Under Bowen’s leadership, the solution was developed to meet the growing demand for flexible, cost-effective fulfillment. In less than three months, Fast Track is proving to be a pivotal offering for modern retailers seeking to meet customer expectations while navigating an increasingly complex logistics landscape.

 

“Radial Fast Track has been a game-changer for our clients, providing a high-performing, low-friction way to scale fulfillment in a volatile market,” said Shauna Bowen, EVP, Chief Digital & Transformation Officer, Radial. “As we integrate our product, technology, and transformation efforts under one team, I’m excited to accelerate innovation that helps brands deliver seamless and reliable experiences from click to delivery.”

 Radial Chief Executive Officer Tom Schmitt added:

 “Jim leaves behind a legacy of steady leadership and forward-thinking vision. We’re grateful for his contributions. At the same time, I couldn’t be more excited to elevate Shauna into this role. She is a bold, proven leader whose work on Radial Fast Track is already reshaping what our clients expect from a 3PL partner,” said Tom Schmitt, CEO, Radial. “With digital transformation now more critical than ever, unifying these functions under her leadership sets Radial up to drive the next wave of eCommerce excellence.”

 Bowen’s promotion aligns with French’s official departure date of June 6, 2025, after completing a seamless leadership transition.
