# Bradley Names Deborah Cazan Office Managing Partner in Atlanta

As Bradley Arant Boult Cummings LLP celebrates the two- year anniversary of its Atlanta office and settles into its renovated space in Midtown’s Promenade Tower, the firm announces that Deborah Cazan has been named the new Atlanta office managing partner. She assumes the role previously held by Sidney S. Welch, who will continue to focus on her clients and strategic business development initiatives.

 “We are grateful for the exceptional work Sidney has done in helping establish our Atlanta office, as well as her leadership in building a culture that has attracted top legal talent and expanded the office from 20 attorneys to more than 60 in the past two years,” said Bradley Chairman of the Board and Managing Partner Jonathan M. Skeeters. “Debbie is the ideal successor for this role, as she will lead the Atlanta office with professionalism and enthusiasm to continue our trajectory of unprecedented growth in Atlanta while working collaboratively across all of the firm’s offices.”

 Ms. Cazan joined Bradley shortly after the Atlanta office opened in May 2023, enhancing the firm’s reputation as a preeminent construction practice with her more than 20 years of experience representing clients in sophisticated litigation, arbitration, and mediation of construction development and real-estate-related disputes. Ms. Cazan has prosecuted and defended complex construction claims across the country and also has significant transactional experience.

 “I am excited to take on this role, and I look forward to building on the success that Sidney helped create. Since this office was launched by bringing together attorneys from leading national law firms from across Atlanta, we have a unique and shared perspective regarding what makes Bradley best-in-class among top-tier firms,” said Ms. Cazan. “I will continue to promote this shared perspective to set the standard for legal excellence in Atlanta, while simultaneously offering our clients access to nationally recognized practice groups and attorneys who are part of Bradley’s broader platform.”

 Now the third largest location in the firm’s footprint, Bradley’s Atlanta office has tripled in size by strategically adding prominent attorneys to meet client demand in key areas, including real estate, litigation, healthcare, corporate, construction, labor and employment, securities, franchise, financial services, and, most recently, intellectual property.

 As one of the fastest-growing offices in Bradley history, the Atlanta office contributed to the firm’s especially strong performance in 2024, which saw double-digit increases in revenue and net income as a result of strategic growth across its footprint and other investments made in the previous five years.
