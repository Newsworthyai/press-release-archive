# Higher Logic Appoints Nicole Saunders to Lead Customer Experience Strategy

ARLINGTON, Va.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Higher Logic, a leading provider of engagement software for associations and organizations, has named Nicole Saunders to lead its customer experience strategy. In this role, she will focus on helping organizations use community to build stronger customer relationships and more connected, purposeful experiences.

 Saunders brings more than 15 years of experience leading community and customer marketing programs at Zendesk, Coupa, and other high-growth technology companies. She is a respected voice in the industry, known for building award-winning programs and sharing insights through her work as a speaker, consultant, and co-host of the CX Nexus podcast.

 At Higher Logic, Saunders will shape how organizations use community as a strategic lever for customer engagement, support, and retention. She will work cross-functionally within the company and alongside clients to bring clarity and structure to programs that drive measurable business outcomes.

 

“Nicole has spent her career helping companies turn customer relationships into long-term growth,” said Rob Wenger, CEO and co-founder of Higher Logic. “She brings a deep understanding of how community strengthens the customer experience, and just as importantly, how to operationalize it. Her leadership will help us continue to raise the bar in how we support our customers.”

 In addition to her internal focus, Saunders will represent Higher Logic externally through industry events, partnerships, and thought leadership. She will play an active role in shaping how the market approaches community-led growth.

 “I’ve worked with some of the most forward-thinking community and customer marketing teams in tech, and I know how challenging it is to balance strategy with execution,” said Saunders. “Higher Logic is in a unique position to support both, and I’m looking forward to helping more teams put the right systems and practices in place to grow with confidence.”

 Saunders will share more of her perspective in an upcoming Higher Logic webinar, “Building Advocacy Pathways in Your Community,” on June 5 at 2 p.m. ET. The session will explore how to align community programs with customer advocacy strategies.
