# Q&amp;A with Rick Harlow, CEO of NovaSpark Energy Corporation

Rick Harlow, CEO of NovaSpark, is a proven technology leader with over 25 years of experience deploying mission-critical tech across the energy, defense, aerospace, and public sectors. He has a strong record of driving innovation, improving performance, and building strategic partnerships. Known for fostering collaboration and delivering results, Rick is leading NovaSpark in transforming how hydrogen energy powers critical operations and long-range drones.

 What is NovaSpark, and what inspired its creation?

 NovaSpark is a mobile, modular hydrogen energy company that makes fuel and power from the water in the air—anywhere on the planet. You can add water from any water source, including lakes or water buffalo, as the military uses for drinking water. Our founders are veterans and technologists who saw firsthand how fuel logistics limit operations in defense, disaster relief, and remote infrastructure. We set out to eliminate the need to transport fuel by creating it onsite, on-demand, in a compact, rugged system.

 What problem is NovaSpark solving that traditional energy technologies haven’t been able to address?

 Diesel generators dominate today’s backup and remote energy market, but they require frequent fuel deliveries, generate emissions, and pose a logistics burden in austere environments. Solar and battery systems can’t generate fuel, and they depend heavily on weather conditions. NovaSpark eliminates those trade-offs. We generate hydrogen fuel andelectricity using water and power, enabling mobile operations that are mobile, lighter, and more resilient.

 Can you explain how NovaSpark’s mobile hydrogen generator works and what makes it unique?

 Our system pulls water from the air, then separates the water molecules using electrolysis to produce clean hydrogen. Hydrogen can then be used immediately to power fuel cells or stored for later use. What makes NovaSpark different is the integration—we have combined hydrogen generation, water extraction, storage, renewable inputs, and safety controls into a single, deployable unit, available in either mobile or modular configurations, with no infrastructure required.

 How is NovaSpark supporting military operations and national security priorities?

 We’ve already deployed our technology with the U.S. Marines during field training and are under contract with the Army, Air Force, AFWERX, and Defense Innovation Unit (DIU). NovaSpark enables fuel independence for forward-operating bases, satellite sites, and drone launch systems—dramatically reducing fuel convoys and resupply risks. Our system also supports power continuity for critical infrastructure in high-risk areas, aligning with new executive orders that prioritize energy resilience.

 How does NovaSpark support hydrogen-powered drones and long-range autonomous systems?

 We’re solving one of the biggest bottlenecks in hydrogen aviation: access to fuel. NovaSpark makes it possible to produce and dispense hydrogen fuel at the edge of the battlefield, runway, or disaster zone. We’re actively collaborating with drone manufacturers, including Lockheed Martin, to support longer flight times and faster refueling cycles. Our mobile hydrogen refueling packages enable drone teams to operate far beyond typical limits.

 What are your biggest challenges in scaling this kind of advanced clean energy technology?

 Supply chain coordination, training, and safety standardization are major hurdles. We’ve addressed this by designing for manufacturability, building strong defense partnerships, and launching a comprehensive hydrogen safety and operations training program, which we are focused on for the military and commercial operations. Scaling fast also requires capital—we’re currently fundraising, working with key venture capital groups, and have recently secured our first VC funding with Boot64 Ventures in Louisiana. We’re focused on creating new jobs in the region and driving economic development in the area.

 What role has the public-private partnership played in your growth?

 It’s been foundational. Our work with the Department of Defense provided us with rigorous field validation early on, and our state partners have helped de-risk manufacturing through incentives and investments. We’ve benefited from support from DIU, the University of Louisiana State University, the Louisiana FUEL program, and accelerators such as Maven Scouts and DCode. These partnerships are essential to bringing energy tech innovation into real-world operations.

 What does the next 12–18 months look like for NovaSpark in terms of expansion and impact?

 We’re focused on scaling production, expanding our drone fueling platform, and deploying to more disaster-prone and defense-critical sites. We have launched a Northeast Louisiana manufacturing hub to support demand and create high-paying jobs in the hydrogen sector. International opportunities are also growing, particularly in allied defense and energy resilience applications. We aim to set the standard for mobile hydrogen deployment, providing reliable backup power and fueling long-range drones. The drones that our partners manufacture can typically fly 10 times further with heavier payloads, and the new Executive Order that enables drones to fly out of line of sight will certainly drive more customers to want to use hydrogen-powered drones.

 What advice would you give to other entrepreneurs tackling challenging tech or energy infrastructure projects?

 Our advice would be to solve a real pain point—one where failure has consequences. Focus on integrated, field-ready solutions rather than piecemeal tech. Build with logistics and training in mind from day one. Most importantly, surround yourself with a team that shares the mission. NovaSpark wouldn’t be possible without the veterans, engineers, and partners who believe in making fuel where it’s needed most.
