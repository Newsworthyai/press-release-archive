# Q&amp;A with Stephanie Owitz, VP of Arts, Culture &amp; Learning at the Adolph &amp; Rose Levis JCC

Stephanie Owitz is the Vice President of Arts, Culture & Learning at the Adolph & Rose Levis JCC Sandler Center in Boca Raton. A professional social worker and longtime community leader, she has been involved with the Levis JCC for more than 25 years, including serving as Board President from 2009–2012. Her work reflects a deep passion for the arts, lifelong learning, and meaningful community connection. She can be reached at stephanieo@levisjcc.org.

 Your journey with the Levis JCC began as a parent—now you’re a longtime professional and leader. What has it meant to grow alongside this community, and how has that shaped your work today?

 I like to say that my children and I grew up together on the Levis JCC campus. What started with preschool drop-offs grew into years of volunteering, meaningful relationships, and eventually a second career that I never expected but feel incredibly grateful for. This campus has truly been the center of my life for three decades. That deep personal connection shapes everything I do—I understand firsthand what this place means to the families and individuals who walk through our doors. It’s not just a job. It’s a privilege to help others find their sense of home here, too.

 How do the arts and cultural programming at the Sandler Center help foster connection and well-being, particularly for those who may be feeling isolated?”

 The antidote to loneliness isn’t always therapy or medication—it’s often connection, purpose, and belonging. That’s where culture comes in. Whether someone attends a film screening, an art lecture, or a book discussion, they’re not just consuming content—they’re sharing space, stories, and experiences. I’ve seen firsthand how a live theatre performance can lift someone’s spirits or how a single conversation in an art class can spark a new friendship. These programs aren’t just enriching—they’re life-affirming.

 What makes the Levis JCC Sandler Center’s cultural and adult learning programs unique—not just in content, but in the way they bring people together?

 Our programming is both high-quality and deeply personal. We curate offerings that challenge people intellectually, stir them emotionally, and connect them socially. But what makes it truly special is the sense of community—our members come not just to learn, but to belong. You’ll see people from different generations and backgrounds coming together over shared interests—talking after a lecture, laughing in the lobby after a show. We’re not just presenting culture—we’re cultivating connection.

 In what ways does your professional background as a social worker shape your approach to leading arts and cultural programming at the Sandler Center?

 Social work is rooted in empathy, in understanding human needs and fostering well-being. That perspective is at the core of how I approach programming. To me, cultural arts are more than entertainment—they’re tools for dialogue. My work is as much about people as it is about programs.

 In a climate where arts funding is often the first to be cut, why do you believe cultural institutions like yours are essential to a healthy, resilient community?

 Cutting arts funding is a mistake with far-reaching consequences. Cultural institutions like ours are the fabric that binds communities together. They reflect our shared values, hold space for diverse voices, and offer people a way to express, reflect, and grow. At a time of rising divisiveness and disconnection, we need more spaces like this—spaces that bring people together, nurture creativity, and remind us of our shared humanity.

 Can you share a moment or story that captures why you do this work?

 There’s not one moment that comes to mind, however throughout my life, especially during challenging times, I have always turned to the arts. Books, films, music, theater and visual art are the food that feeds my soul. I find beauty, joy, wisdom, empathy, comfort and inspiration through the arts and I know that they can affect others in the same way. I feel incredibly lucky to have a job where I can be immersed in the things that I love and share that love with others.

 Looking ahead, what are your hopes for the future of the Levis JCC Sandler Center, and how can the community support and sustain this important work?

 My hope is that we continue to grow—not just in the number of programs we offer, but in the depth of connection we create. I want more people to walk through our doors and feel seen, inspired, and part of something greater. To sustain that, we need the community’s partnership—through participation, advocacy, donations, and even just spreading the word. The arts are not a luxury; they are a lifeline. Together, we can make sure that lifeline remains strong for generations to come.
