# The Dimples Company Celebrates National Dimples Day on July 9 and Unveils a Full Lifestyle Brand for Dimple Lovers

The Dimples company is proud to announce the annual celebration of National Dimples Day on July 9 and is dedicated to celebrating the unique charm of dimples. This newly established holiday is committed to embracing the joy, beauty, and individuality of dimples in all their forms—from cheek and chin to lower back and beyond.

 Founded by serial entrepreneur and wealth advisor turned lifestyle visionary Graceful Grady, the Dimples company is on a mission to transform a beloved natural feature into a movement that brings smiles to faces worldwide.

 “Our tagline says it all: Dimples. More than a treat. A reason to celebrate,” said Graceful Grady. “National Dimples Day is about pride, community, and creating something positive that people with dimples ––and those who love people with dimples––can rally around.”

 From an Inspired Idea to a National Holiday

 The spark for National Dimples Day was unexpectedly personal and serendipitous. In December 2021, while watching TV and hearing about other quirky national days, Grady wondered if such a day existed for dimples.

 A follow-up with the National Day Calendar team in early 2022 confirmed that no such day existed—a revelation that surprised him. Grady quickly filed the paperwork and, after receiving the official proclamation, declared July 9 as National Dimples Day.

 The date now stands as an annual opportunity for people worldwide to celebrate their dimples proudly, share stories, and connect with a growing community.

 Building a Brand Around Dimples

 While National Dimples Day is the heart of the movement, Dimples LLC is expanding its mission with a range of fun, innovative and business-oriented ventures:

 * The Dimple Store: A lifestyle brand offering dimple-inspired apparel, accessories, and gifts for the “Dimple Nation.”
* The Dimple Report: A lively, informative podcast exploring the culture, science, and personal stories behind dimples.
* Dimple Doings: A platform for events, contests, and experiences celebrating dimples, including plans for the Dimples Open (a golf tournament) and Dimplefest (a signature annual gathering).

 “Everything starts and returns to National Dimples Day,” said Grady. “But from there, we’re creating sustainable business opportunities that build community, celebrate uniqueness, and bring people together.”

 A Unique Market Opportunity

 Though only about 20% of people have classic cheek dimples, they’re just one part of a broader world of dimple types—from chin clefts to lower-back “dimples of Venus” and rare shoulder dimples.

 Grady is determined to celebrate them all and educate the world about their variety and charm.

 “Dimples are rare, beautiful, and diverse,” said Grady. “We want people to be proud of them. We’re also tapping into an incredibly underserved niche with real business potential.”

 Upcoming Highlights

 Dimples LLC has an ambitious roadmap, with upcoming initiatives including:

 * National Dimples Day activations and online campaigns on July 9.
* The Dimples Open, a branded golf event bringing the community together in style.
* The Dimple Report podcast launch, delivering entertainment, interviews, and dimple lore.
* Continued expansion of The Dimple Store with new designs and partnerships.

 Grady also recently appeared on the TV series Go Fund Yourself on Cheddar TV, introducing the brand’s vision to investors and audiences nationwide and highlighting the cultural and commercial power of this joyful concept.

 The mission is to build a community around dimples while creating sustainable revenue streams through branded merchandise, experiential events, and cultural impact.

 According to Grady, dimples aren’t just a feature—they’re a lifestyle, a celebration, and a business opportunity waiting to smile back at you.
