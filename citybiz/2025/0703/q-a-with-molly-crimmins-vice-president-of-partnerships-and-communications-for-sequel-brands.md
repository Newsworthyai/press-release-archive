 How does the partnership strategy at Sequel Brands complement the vision for building a modern, scalable wellness portfolio?

 Just like our portfolio, partnerships at Sequel Brands are diverse by design. We look at the comprehensive wellness ecosystem and integrate partners that add real value to the brand and studios. We’re less interested in logos and much more focused on alignment and shared values. Whether it’s a wellness tech brand, a functional nutrition partner or a studio essentials provider, every collaboration needs to elevate the client experience, support our franchisees and reinforce our long-term vision: creating a connected, future-forward ecosystem for movement and recovery. Scale matters, but so does vision and impact. The right partners help us build both.

 What role do strategic partnerships play in distinguishing Sequel from other franchisors in the wellness and fitness sector?

 Strategic partnerships enable us to support our franchisees and expand the definition of wellness across our studios. From exclusive supplier access to experiential activations, our partnerships turn static studio models into dynamic wellness hubs. It’s not just about having better equipment or pricing; it’s about creating a better overall experience. That’s where I believe we can differentiate.

 How are you approaching brand-aligned partnerships to drive awareness across both consumer and franchise audiences?

 We always ask: Does this partner elevate our message or dilute it? We want to work with brands that have real traction, real trust and a real following. For consumers, that means collaborations that enhance the everyday wellness routine…think clean products, recovery tools or co-branded events. For franchise owners and prospects, it’s about proving that we’re not just another concept; we’re building a real culture that extends far beyond a studio’s four walls. Our partnerships reflect that.

 As Sequel expands its franchise footprint, how do partnerships support franchisee success at both the local and national levels?

 We view partnerships as an accelerator for franchisee momentum. Nationally, we negotiate access to high-value perks, including competitive retail pricing, media amplification and best-in-class training tools. Locally, we help owners connect with their communities through curated, authentic partnerships that resonate with their members. It’s not one-size-fits-all. We build the structure, then give franchisees the tools to make it their own.

 What communications resources or messaging support do you provide to franchisees to help them connect with their communities?

 Communication is about helping our franchise owners lead. We build toolkits, talking points, campaign calendars and internal memos that give franchisees real clarity: what’s coming, why it matters and how to activate it locally. Our job is to distill the noise so they can focus on execution. Whether it’s a new launch or a weekly update, we ensure they understand the “what” and the “why.” From there, the goal is to connect in the community. We provide the necessary tools and guidance to help every franchisee consistently represent their brand while still sounding authentic. We want every message to feel like a conversation, not a campaign.

 How do you collaborate with the franchise development team to ensure partnerships and communications are aligned with growth objectives?

 We’re one team with one mission: build strong, sustainable studios.

 I stay closely connected to franchise development and operations to ensure messaging and partnerships support the bigger picture. That means aligned planning, consistent communication and feedback loops that drive action. We don’t push information at franchisees; we build communication with them. That’s how you scale culture alongside systems.

 How is Sequel Brands building relationships with media, influencers and thought leaders to elevate its visibility in the wellness space?

 Sequel collaborates with credible voices who actually live the lifestyle our brands represent. Whether it’s wellness influencers, fitness pros, recovery experts, or cultural connectors, we’re focused on real alignment and long-term energy. Visibility matters, but trust matters more. We want our brands showing up in the fun, IG-worthy moments and in the conversations that actually move the space forward.

 How do you approach communications strategy to ensure consistent brand storytelling across four distinct concepts and a growing franchise network?

 Every Sequel brand has its own identity, its own energy and its own voice. We’re not trying to make every concept sound the same. What we are doing is ensuring that each tells a story that reinforces our bigger mission: helping more people move better, feel better and live longer through impactful wellness experiences. This shows up in the way we talk about transformation, accessibility and results…from Pilates to EMS to assisted stretch. We’ve built a strategic messaging framework that’s flexible enough for each brand to have its own tone yet structured enough to maintain consistency across consumer and franchise communications. Internally, that means giving teams shared language, clear positioning and a roadmap for how to show up, whether that be on social, in press, at launch events or in a local studio welcome email.

 Looking ahead, what do you see as the biggest opportunities for partnerships and communications to shape Sequel Brands’ long-term growth?

 The future of wellness is not siloed. People don’t think in categories; they think in outcomes. They want strength, energy, resilience and recovery at their fingertips. Our job is to build partnerships and tell stories that reflect that reality. The more we connect the dots between brands, benefits and real life, the more valuable our ecosystem becomes. That’s how we scale, with clarity, consistency and momentum.

 Sequel Brands is a next-generation fitness franchisor redefining movement, recovery and wellness. With an experienced leadership team and an impressive portfolio of high-growth concepts, including Pilates Addiction, iFlex Stretch Studios, beem Light Sauna and BODY20, Sequel offers franchise owners and community members a platform built for long-term success and cultural relevance. Led by Anthony Geisler and a growing team of franchise experts, Sequel is shaping the future of fitness one powerful concept at a time. For more information about our brands, visit sequelbrands.com.
