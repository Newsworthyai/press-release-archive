# OvareGroup Unites Portfolio into TogetherWith, Betting on Creative Tension and Cross-Continental Chemistry

What do fried chicken and Malbec have in common? On the surface, not much—until you try them together. That’s the thinking behind the newly announced transformation of OvareGroup: a full consolidation of its agency brands under the banner of Argentine-American shop TogetherWith.

 Since announcing its acquisition of Buenos Aires-based TogetherWith in January, OvareGroup has decided to adopt the TogetherWith name while dropping the traditional holding-company model altogether. The legacy and expertise of agencies like AdCucina, &Well, and PowerScoppechio are now contributing to a single, unified agency with creative hubs in Louisville, Miami, and Buenos Aires.

 “What started as a strategic partnership just a few years ago has become something much bigger,” said Santiago Puiggari, founding partner of TogetherWith. “We’re not just integrating agencies — we’re creating a new model. One team, one vision, fueled by diverse markets and perspectives, built for the future of creativity.”

 It’s a sharp pivot from a typical merger story. Rather than operating as a traditional holding company, OvareGroup is unifying under the TogetherWith identity, blending the unique DNA and capabilities of each agency into a shared vision for cross-continental creativity.

 “Creativity needs contrast,” said Heidi Singleton, Chief Creative Officer. “We don’t want a sanitized, flat worldview. We want the tension between cities, languages, and perspectives—that’s where the best ideas come from. Louisville and Buenos Aires aren’t just offices—they’re fuel.”

 The announcement comes as the unified agency serves clients including Baptist Health, KFC, GE Appliances, LongHorn, Dell, GCOC, Christus Health, Brown-Forman, Stellantis, Jeep, RAM, Comcast, Ingredion, and Prodeman. New creative hires are in progress to deepen the Louisville bench, and the company plans to unveil a full brand identity in the coming weeks.

 “We’re finally becoming what we always wanted to be—one unified team instead of a collection of separate shops,” added Brandi Lafontaine, CEO. “The technology and AI capabilities we’re building into this new structure will let us do things we couldn’t do before.”

 From the outside, Louisville and Buenos Aires may seem like strange bedfellows. But that’s exactly the point.

 “Anyone can talk about integration,” added Lafontaine. “We’re actually living it—across borders, across brands, across disciplines. This is what creative evolution can look like.”
