# Palm Beach Autographs Hosts The Florida Panthers at The Mall at Wellington Green

The 2025 Stanley Cup champions, the Florida Panthers skated into Palm Beach Autographs at The Mall at Wellington Green where they recently signed autographs and spent quality time mingling and hanging out with their fans.

 Panthers center and playoffs MVP Sam Bennett, left winger Jonah Gadjovich, and right winger Brad Marchand each spent rousing afternoons posing for photos, signing memorabilia, and even getting into an occasional fight pose with die-hard fans and families (and a few jersey-clad canines) who waited for hours in line to see their favorite players.

 “Bringing the Stanley Cup champions to Wellington is always a huge thrill for the community,” said Jim Dodson, owner of Palm Beach Autographs. “It’s not every day you get to meet your hockey heroes face-to-face. The energy from the fans and players was incredible.” The event also included a silent auction featuring must-have memorabilia and a hat trick mystery box containing autographed items.

 Palm Beach Autographs is located at The Mall at Wellington Green, 10300 Forest Hill Blvd., Wellington. For more information, call (561) 340-2921 or visit palmbeachautographs.com.
