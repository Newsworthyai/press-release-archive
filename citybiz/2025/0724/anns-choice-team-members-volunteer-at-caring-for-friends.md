# Ann’s Choice Team Members Volunteer at Caring For Friends

Ann’s Choice employees recently volunteered at Caring for Friends as part of the community’s “Volunteer with Me” program. Director of Human Resources Jeannette Collins and Director of Resident Life Trisha Malabuyo joined 9 team members in making over 500 sandwiches for local families in need, while singing along to classic 90s hits during the fun-filled excursion.

 The “Volunteer with Me” program allows employees to use their paid volunteer hours at a community outreach outing sponsored by an executive team member.

 “I’m grateful to work for a company that encourages us to step out of the office and into our communities. Moments like these remind me how powerful even small acts of kindness can be,” said Human Resources Director Jeannette Collins.

 Ann’s Choice was recognized as the Kitchen Team of the Year for 2024 by Caring for Friends, a local nonprofit dedicated to serving those in need.

 The Erickson Senior Living-managed community in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, provides a robust package of benefits that reflect its commitment to financial stability, health and well-being, and work-life balance. In addition to multiple health care plans and choices, Ann’s Choice offers 40 paid community volunteer hours.
