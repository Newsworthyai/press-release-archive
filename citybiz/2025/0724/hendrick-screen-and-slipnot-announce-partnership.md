# Hendrick Screen and SLIPNOT Announce Partnership

DETROIT–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Hendrick Screen and SLIPNOT are proud to announce that they have entered into a partnership after signing a co-marketing agreement earlier this year. Since 2012, Hendrick Screen and SLIPNOT have been working together to provide top quality products to architectural customers in North America. It was time to make this long-standing professional relationship official. “SLIPNOT and Hendrick have worked together on various projects for over a decade. We are excited to formalize the partnership to better serve both of our customer bases with our unique products,” says Kevin Koder, President and CEO, SLIPNOT.

 Hendrick Screen, an Etnyre International Company, began its manufacturing operations in 1974 in Owensboro, KY, USA. For over 50 years, Hendrick Screen has been known worldwide as a manufacturer of high-quality, wedge wire & profile bar products. In addition to architectural grates and grilles, Hendrick also provides screen solutions for the water intake, wastewater, fish diversion, petrochemical, pulp and paper, food and beverage, and the mining and aggregate industries.

 SLIPNOT® is a leading provider of specialized safety flooring products and surface technologies, covering walkways, entryways, stairs and ladders where you live work and play. When transforming potentially hazardous spaces into SLIPNOT environments, over 90% of slips and falls can be avoided. All SLIPNOT products and technologies are manufactured in the USA.

 Both Hendrick and SLIPNOT recognize each other’s unmatched commitment to customer service and product durability. By marketing and selling their products together, they offer new opportunities to educate architectural designers beyond just the individual product benefits, by demonstrating how both products are manufactured to work together. Hendrick metal grates and grilles with Genuine SLIPNOT® not only meet but exceed regulations. In addition, this new partnership will provide many added benefits to customers including faster delivery via a streamlined design and ordering process, enhanced quality control, and highly aesthetic interior and exterior architectural feature options.

 Products included in this co-marketing agreement include SLIPNOT’s proprietary slip resistant coating, along with several architectural products from Hendrick:

 * Entrance grilles
* Stair components
* Tree grating
* Trench grating
* Drain covers
* Fountain grating
* Ventilation grilles

 “We are excited to have announced this partnership at this year’s AIA Conference on Architecture and Design,” said Robert McDole, Vice President and General Manager, Hendrick Screen. “Both companies exhibited and we were proud to showcase Hendrick products with SLIPNOT coatings in our AIA Expo booths. Delivering high quality and safe solutions are at the core of this partnership.”
