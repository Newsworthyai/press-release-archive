# Toxic Truth: 91% of Homes Haven’t Been Tested for Asbestos, and Buyers Are Bailing

A new national survey commissioned by Asbestos Claims.Law reveals that asbestos, long considered a legacy hazard, is quietly becoming a modern real estate risk. More than one-third of prospective homebuyers (35%) say they would walk away from a deal if asbestos was discovered, yet 91% of homeowners report they have never tested their home for asbestos. Eighty-two percent of U.S. adults believe testing should be legally required before any sale or renovation.

 As natural disasters like wildfires, winds, and floods disturb aging homes, and as renovation activity on older homes increases nationwide, concern about asbestos is growing — especially among younger generations. Forty percent of Gen Xers said they would walk away from a home purchase if asbestos was discovered and 69 percent of Americans say they are extremely or very concerned about exposure to asbestos in their home. Still, with no federal mandate to test, millions of homes are bought, sold, and remodeled without any asbestos screening at all, leaving millions of people potentially at risk for cancer and other asbestos-related illnesses.

 The survey sheds light on how concerns around asbestos are influencing homebuying decisions and where the system is falling short for identifying potential health hazards.

 The Real Estate Disconnect

 When asked how they would respond if asbestos was found during the homebuying process, over 70% indicated a potential home sale would be at risk:

 * 36% said they would proceed only if the seller or contractor paid for removal
* 35% said they would walk away from the deal entirely
* 17% weren’t sure how they’d respond or who should be responsible
* 12% said they would still purchase the home and take responsibility for monitoring or removal

 Despite these concerns, testing is rarely conducted or required, even after disruptive or high-risk events:

 * 19% tested before a minor renovation
* 15% tested before a major renovation
* Only 8% tested after a wildfire, flood, or natural disaster damaged the home
* 6% tested before rebuilding on a property where a home was destroyed
* 4% tested before demolition of part or all of the home

 When homeowners were asked why they didn’t test:

 * 44% said they weren’t aware it was necessary
* 29% said they relied on a contractor or insurance provider to manage it
* 9% assumed authorities had already cleared the asbestos risk

 “We’ve seen a surge of wildfire-related rebuilds in California and across the West, as well as a significant increase in older home renovations nationwide,” said Justinian C. Lane, an asbestos safety and legal expert and founder of AsbestosClaims.law. “But hardly anyone tests for asbestos in these cases. That’s a public health oversight, not just a missed checkbox.”

 What One Generation Fears, Another Ignores

 The survey revealed clear generational differences in concern, awareness, and action around asbestos in the home:

 * Millennials (36%) and Gen Z (35%) were the most concerned about asbestos exposure
* Yet, Gen Xers (40%) were the most likely to say they would walk away from a home purchase if asbestos was discovered
* Millennials (17%) were the most likely to know whether their home contains asbestos compared to 13% of Gen Z, 8% of Gen X, and just 1% of Boomers

 When asked where asbestos might be hiding, the most common responses were:

 * Insulation (30%)
* Textured “popcorn” ceilings (19%)
* Roofing materials or shingles (19%)

 Other high-risk materials, like pipe insulation, floor tiles, and adhesives, were rarely mentioned, underscoring a widespread lack of asbestos awareness across all age groups.

 A Legal Grey Area

 While the EPA has banned several specific asbestos-containing products, there is still no federal requirement for testing homes during real estate transactions or renovations. That means decisions are often left to individual sellers, buyers, or contractors, many of whom may be unaware of the legal and health risks.

 “If there’s lead paint, sellers are required to disclose it. But with asbestos, there’s no such disclosure requirements,” Lane said. “A 2020 CDC report found a worrisome increase in cases of asbestos-related mesothelioma among homemakers, so the data shows there is a problem. We need the real estate, construction, and inspection industries to help close this gap. Right now, most people don’t even know what questions to ask.”

 About the Asbestos and Home Safety Survey This online survey of 1,046 U.S. adults aged 18 and older was conducted from June 27 to 29, 2025, by market research firm Researchscape on behalf of Asbestos Claims.Law. The credibility interval for questions answered by all respondents is plus or minus 3 percentage points.
