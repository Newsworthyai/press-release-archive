# AIR Communities Named Real Estate Top Workplace Winner by Energage

DENVER–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Apartment Income REIT has been named a Real Estate Top Workplace winner by Energage, a purpose-driven company that helps organizations turn employee feedback into business intelligence. AIR was one of only 23 companies in its size category to earn this prestigious industry recognition, which celebrates organizations that have built people-first workplace cultures within the real estate sector.

 “Being recognized as a Top Workplace in Real Estate affirms the intentional AIR culture that we have built together. It’s an honor to be a stand-out among our industry peers,” said Beth Harmon, Senior Vice President of Human Resources. “This award celebrates our investment in professional development, competitive benefits, and creating an environment where each teammate feels valued and engaged. We know that prioritizing our teammates creates positive outcomes not only for them, but also for our residents, communities, and business.”

 Top Workplaces awards are based on feedback from a research-backed employee engagement survey that measures critical culture drivers including alignment, execution, and connection.

 “Earning a Top Workplaces award is a badge of honor for companies, especially because it comes authentically from their employees,” said Eric Rubino, Energage CEO. “That’s something to be proud of. In today’s market, leaders must ensure they’re allowing employees to have a voice and be heard. That’s paramount. Top Workplaces do this, and it pays dividends.”

 This latest recognition adds to AIR’s impressive track record of workplace excellence. Earlier this year, AIR was named a National Top Workplace for the fourth consecutive year, in addition to being named a Top Workplace in Colorado, Philadelphia, South Florida, and Los Angeles. The company has a decades-long history of regional Top Workplace wins across its major markets, including Denver, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Washington, D.C.
