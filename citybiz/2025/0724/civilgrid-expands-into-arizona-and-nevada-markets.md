# CivilGrid Expands into Arizona and Nevada Markets

SAN FRANCISCO, July 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — CivilGrid, the civil design intelligence company, announced today its expansion into the Arizona and Nevada markets. This expansion will improve the building process for civil engineers and construction teams in the region. Often referred to as the ‘Google Maps for the underground,’ CivilGrid centralizes unprecedented utility maps and historical site datasets in an intuitive, on-demand platform where teams collaborate to plan and design projects.

 Pre-construction engineering and on-site construction face complex challenges, with over $100 billion lost annually due to planning-related construction errors, and 92% of projects exceeding their budget or schedule. CivilGrid provides the first-of-its-kind dataset that de-risks and accelerates due diligence, engineering, and construction processes to combat these issues.

 “CivilGrid is a great tool for our pipeline projects for providing instant access to utility information during the planning and early design stages, identifying affected agencies along an alignment, and capturing field observations that aid in decision making for our designs,” said Caisey Raines, US West Business Group Leader, Linear Infrastructure GHD.

 CivilGrid’s unique benefits include accelerating pre-construction phases by up to 90%, reducing design delays and field surprises through curated datasets, and improving project scope accuracy with on-demand data.

 “I recommend CivilGrid to all utilities. They are a reliable source for the vital combined utility information that doesn’t exist in most areas,” said Bill Tuttle, VP of Engineering, San Jose Water.

 Engineering teams in these regions face similar challenges to those in California, including fragmented data sources, time-consuming research phases, and a need for improved coordination between office planning and field execution. CivilGrid’s platform addresses these pain points by consolidating critical utility information and streamlining the pre-construction process.

 “Engineering firms are expected to deliver faster, more accurate work while navigating increasingly complex underground utility landscapes with outdated tools,” said Josh Mackanic, CEO and Co-Founder of CivilGrid. “Our expansion into Arizona and Nevada tackles this head-on. When engineering teams spend weeks or months hunting for accurate utility data, there is an opportunity to address it. CivilGrid eliminates this inefficiency by centralizing crucial datasets that dramatically reduce design delays and field surprises. This move responds to our California clients who need our platform for their cross-state projects and a waitlist of Nevada and Arizona firms asking us to expand our coverage area.”
