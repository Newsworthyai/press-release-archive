# Wellness with a Mission: Dr!p and Warrior Salt Deliver High-Performance Pitches on Go Fund Yourself

Episode 9 of Go Fund Yourself, Cheddar TV’s business-meets-crowdfunding series, aires on July 24th with two health-forward CPG startups showcasing not just their products—but their purpose-driven business models.

 In front of the show’s panel of elite investors and entrepreneurs—dubbed the “Titans”—including Rory Cutaia, Jayson Waller, and David Meltzer, founders from Dr!p by Dierre Brands and Warrior Salt presented growth-ready ventures built on wellness, innovation, and meaningful social impact.

 For early-stage investors and growth-focused viewers, this episode highlighted how today’s high-performing brands are scaling with both profit and purpose in mind.

 

 Dr!p: Reimagining Hydration for the Modern Consumer

 Clarence Taylor, founder of Dr!p, introduced a functional beverage product that’s perfectly aligned with the growing demand for clean, on-the-go wellness solutions. Dr!p is a sugar-free, flavor-packed drop that turns any glass of water into a performance-enhancing drink—with 100 mg of L-Theanine for focus and calm, plus electrolytes for hydration and recovery.

 More than a beverage enhancer, Dr!p is being positioned as a lifestyle brand. Ten percent of the company’s profits support mental health initiatives, giving consumers a direct connection between their purchase and a meaningful cause.

 “In the post-pandemic wellness economy, consumers are looking for more than functionality—they want transparency, trust, and values,” Taylor said during his pitch. “Dr!p delivers all three.”

 The Titans responded favorably to both the product and the strategy, recognizing the brand’s strong market fit, high-margin potential, and scalable social mission. Learn more at Dr!p’s wefunder here: https://wefunder.com/dierre.brands.beverage.company.llc

 Warrior Salt: A Clean-Label Brand with a Global Impact

 Next to take the stage was Eli Hamgeri, founder of Warrior Salt, a clean electrolyte powder developed without artificial sweeteners, fillers, or preservatives. Unlike many competitors, Warrior Salt relies on pink Himalayan salt, real fruit powders, potassium and magnesium chlorides, and a trace of cane sugar for flavor and function.

 But the pitch extended beyond product integrity. With every unit sold, Warrior Salt funds 1,100 liters of clean water for underserved communities through its partnership with Charity Water—a model that blends ecommerce and philanthropy in a seamless, scalable way.

 “This is a brand that’s rooted in science, customer feedback, and mission-driven leadership,” Hamgeri told the panel. “We’ve built it from the kitchen up—and now we’re ready to scale.”

 Investor and GFY panelist David Meltzer highlighted the brand’s alignment with global wellness trends and social enterprise momentum: “There’s a growing segment of customers—and investors—who want to support companies that make a real difference.” Visit Warrior Salt’s wefunder to learn more here: https://wefunder.com/warrior.salt

 The GFY Edge: Capital, Community, and Strategic Visibility

 Unlike traditional funding shows, Go Fund Yourself democratizes the investment process. Founders pitch not only to the Titans, but also to viewers who can fund deals live through the show’s crowdfunding platform. That makes each episode a unique opportunity for exposure, capital, and strategic partnerships.

 For Clarence Taylor and Eli Hamgeri, the experience offers more than just potential funding—it positions them among a new wave of CPG entrepreneurs building brands that blend purpose with profitability.

 Go Fund Yourself continues to carve out a niche where innovation, authenticity, and investor access intersect. Episode 9 proved that in the wellness and hydration space, mission matters—and execution is everything.
