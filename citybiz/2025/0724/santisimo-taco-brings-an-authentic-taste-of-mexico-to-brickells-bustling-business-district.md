# Santisimo Taco Brings an Authentic Taste of Mexico to Brickell’s Bustling Business District

Brickell’s culinary scene just got a flavorful new addition with the opening of Santisimo Taco, a fast-casual concept that’s redefining what it means to grab tacos in Miami. Located in the heart of the city’s financial district, the restaurant brings a truly authentic Mexican taco experience to an area known more for its upscale eateries than its street food staples.

 Founded with a mission to offer a taste of Mexico City in the middle of Miami, Santisimo Taco is rooted in generations-old family recipes passed down from the co-founders’ abuelas. With tortillas made fresh daily and a menu crafted by a Maestro Taquero, the restaurant delivers a menu that’s both steeped in heritage and designed for the fast pace of city life.

 

 What sets Santisimo Taco apart isn’t just the quality of the food—it’s the business model. With an emphasis on accessibility and authenticity, the brand is tapping into a growing demand for lunch and dinner options that are fast, affordable, and full of flavor. In a neighborhood that often skews expensive, Santisimo offers one of the best-value meals in Brickell—without sacrificing experience or taste.

 “Our goal was to create a space that feels like a taco stand in Mexico,” said Santisimo Co-Founder, Jose Luis Serrato Villegas. “We wanted to bring that same warmth and authenticity to Brickell, while making it easy for people on the go to enjoy a real Mexican meal.”

 Open daily, Santisimo Taco is already becoming a go-to for professionals looking to grab a quick but satisfying lunch, and for residents craving something crave-worthy after hours. Its Taco Tuesday deals offer a rotating selection of two tacos for the price of one, adding an irresistible midweek draw for locals and visitors alike.

 Whether you’re grabbing lunch between meetings or meeting friends after work, Santisimo Taco offers an experience that’s simple, vibrant, and unmistakably Mexican—right in the heart of Miami’s most energetic neighborhood.
