# Veteran Sea Tow Captains Share Tips to Help Boaters Steer Clear of Common Mistakes

Boating season is already in full throttle, and Sea Tow®, recognized throughout the marine industry as Your Road Service at Sea®, is proud to offer boating tips to avoid some of the most common mistakes seen on the water.

 Sea Tow offers a variety of services to assist boaters, with its top five covered services being towing (52%), scheduled dock-to-dock tows (11%), covered ungroundings (10%), jump starts (7%), and fuel, oil or parts delivery (7%). Sea Tow has observed countless mishaps that, in many cases, could have been easily avoided. Seasoned Sea Tow Captains have offered up their advice to help boaters steer clear of common mistakes this season:

 Captain Nik Foster of Sea Tow Daytona/Ponce/New Smyrna:

 * Check that the throttle is in neutral if the boat won’t start: General rule of thumb, the engine should always be off when the boat is anchored. When anchored with a group on board, it’s possible for the throttles to accidentally be knocked into gear. If the captain doesn’t realize it, next time they turn the key, the boat won’t start.
* Check battery connection: A marine battery typically lasts about two years. Before leaving the dock, always check the batteries to ensure they are charged. Also, check the connection at each terminal – corrosion can cause cables to come loose – as well as the engine side, especially if the boat has been sitting for a while.

 Captain John Bilski of Sea Tow Southern Connecticut:

 * Use a VHF Radio: It is ideal to have a VHF radio with at least a six-to eight-foot antenna. The taller the antenna, the longer the range of transmitting and receiving messages with other boaters on the water. Channel 16 is the national distress, safety and hailing channel, where the Coast Guard, Sea Tow and other boaters around can hear the transmitted message. It is recommended to use VHF Ch. 9 for hailing other vessels to keep Ch. 16 free for emergency communications.
* File a float plan: Always file a float plan with a trusted friend or family member to ensure someone on land knows the boating plans for the day. It should include the time of departure, destination(s) and the time of return. If the boater does not return or check-in as planned, the person will be able to alert authorities, who will then know how much time has passed and when and where to start looking, so they can find the boat quickly.

 Captain Ryan Saporito of Sea Tow Wrightsville Beach:

 * Remain weather aware: Weather conditions on the water can change at the drop of a hat. The boater should always keep their eyes and ears to the sky for any tells such as clouds rolling in, thunder or lightning in the distance or increased winds. Download a weather app and turn on notifications to receive alerts in real time.
* Know how to use the anchor: The vast majority of breakdown situations can be managed by putting an anchor out and taking time to assess the problem and determine what’s wrong with the boat, rather than drifting.
* Utilize engine cut-off switch: Federal law requires boats under 26 feet to have, and captains to use, an engine cut-off switch, whether it’s a cord or wireless fob. If the boater is thrown from the helm, it immediately shuts down the engine, keeping the boat from running away, and if they’re thrown overboard, a potential prop strike. It’s a must-have safety feature.

 Captain Ramsey Chason of Sea Tow Rhode Island and Sea Tow Cape and Islands:

 * Get boat insurance: Far too many people don’t place enough value on comprehensive general liability insurance and a full policy on their boat.
* Be aware of ethanol/fuel stabilizing: It’s important to stabilize fuel when storing boats over the winter. Fill fuel tanks completely to minimize condensation and limit air space. For gas-powered boats, use water separators.
* Get a Sea Tow membership: A Sea Tow membership is invaluable when it comes to feeling safe when on the water. It includes a full suite of on-water assistance services for every boat that’s owned, rented, or bareboat chartered. With a Sea Tow membership, boaters know who will be coming to get them.

 “Sea Tow is standing by to help with these common issues that boaters face,” said Sea Tow President Kristen Frohnhoefer.“As the boating season kicks into high gear, know that Captains are a resource for local knowledge. Whether that’s navigation and referrals, anchorage locations, troubleshooting, or tides and weather, Sea Tow Captains are pleased to provide tips to help prevent the common mistakes we see out on the water.”
