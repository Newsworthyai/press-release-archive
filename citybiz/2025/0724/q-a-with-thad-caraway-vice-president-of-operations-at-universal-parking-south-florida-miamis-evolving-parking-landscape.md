# Q&amp;A with Thad Caraway, Vice President of Operations at Universal Parking South Florida: Miami’s Evolving Parking Landscape

The need for parking in Miami has grown in tandem with the city’s rapid population and tourism growth. As of July 1, 2024, Miami-Dade County’s population was estimated at 2,838,461, marking a 5.1% increase since April 2020 and a 2.3% rise—or 64,211 new residents—from mid-2023 to mid-2024. Miami is also the second most visited city in the US, behind only New York City. With a steady stream of tourists and rapid population growth comes the need for additional parking.

 We caught up with Thad to discuss the evolving parking landscape in South Florida.

 What is the current landscape in Miami?

 Miami is a commuter city, with more than 80% of residents relying on cars to get to work. While public transit options like Metrorail, Tri-Rail, and Brightline exist, coverage is limited, so most commuters still drive. Miami’s heavy investment in parking infrastructure and the demand for downtown commuter garages reflect this strong car-centric culture. Areas like Brickell and Downtown Miami are experiencing dense development, which further emphasizes the need for parking options.

 Additionally, Miami must deal with tourism parking. According to the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau, Miami-Dade County experienced sustained tourism growth in 2024, attracting over 28 million visitors, the highest number ever recorded in a single year. Furthermore, PortMiami handled more than 7.3 million cruise passengers in 2023, creating intense demand for cruise and short-term parking. The port currently manages more than 4,000 parking spots.

 What trends are impacting parking in the city?

 The “Parkitecture” trend, a fusion of parking, architecture and public art, has taken firm hold in Miami, particularly in neighborhoods like the Miami Design District. Here, parking structures are reimagined as design landmarks, not just utilitarian buildings. While you see Parkitecture in other cities, Miami is one of the leading cities in the country embracing it at scale. These innovative garages serve both practical and cultural purposes, transforming parking infrastructure into vibrant community assets.

 Miami is also leading the way in smart curb management. The city is utilizing solar-powered cameras, AI and license-plate recognition (LPR) to enforce SMART Loading Zones. It is initially piloting 26 zones across downtown and Brickell with automated per-minute billing.

 This is just one example of the rapid growth we are seeing in smart parking solutions in Miami. We are also seeing widespread adoption of mobile payment systems and dynamic pricing in garages and surface lots. Many cruise terminals, for instance, are now integrating parking reservations directly into cruise bookings. These systems use LPR to allow seamless garage access, minimizing delays. By connecting parking to ship itineraries and providing guaranteed space, these solutions help guests start their vacation stress-free.

 Together, these trends signal a shift from traditional parking toward flexible and innovative parking solutions aimed at convenience for both parkers and garage and lot owners. Drivers are growing increasingly impatient with the time it takes to find available parking and dealing with faulty payment systems. Parking apps that enable drivers to locate, reserve, and pay for parking spots from their phones, helping to avoid the inconvenience of malfunctioning machines and cash-only parking, are becoming very popular. Some apps even provide real-time visibility into current parking availability, helping drivers reduce the time spent circling for a spot, as well as offering options for remote time extensions and flexible payment methods.

 Can you tell me more about some of these technology solutions?

 The widespread adoption of these smart parking solutions and the rise of app-based payment systems are helping to make parking more efficient. Still, parking solutions are not one-size-fits-all for businesses or parkers. There are still some drivers who don’t use smartphones, and some parkers need to pay in cash. Additionally, some companies may not be able to afford the necessary infrastructure to support smart parking technology.

 Other issues with parking apps include connection problems in areas with poor cell service or mistakes, such as entering the wrong license plate or zone number, which can result in unnecessary fines. That said, parking apps tend to be most effective in urban areas, like Miami, because parking demand is high and digital infrastructure is robust.

 What does the future of parking look like in Miami?

 In Miami, automation and the use of technology will continue to grow. In some instances, however, a more hybrid approach that integrates smart apps with staffed parking lots may make more sense.

 In a hybrid system, smart apps offer real-time availability and contactless payment options to parkers, while also providing key data insights on usage patterns, peak parking times, and durations to businesses and lot owners. Staffed operators can offer personal assistance to parkers and provide an enhanced sense of security. This combination enables businesses to optimize parking turnover, implement dynamic pricing, and create a safer and more reliable parking environment.

 At the end of the day, parking isn’t just about vehicles; it’s about people. Whether it’s a commuter, a cruise passenger or a tourist going shopping, they want convenience and a feeling of security.
