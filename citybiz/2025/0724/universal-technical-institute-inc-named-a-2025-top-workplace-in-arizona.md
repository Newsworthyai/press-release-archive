# Universal Technical Institute, Inc. Named a 2025 Top Workplace in Arizona

PHOENIX, July 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Universal Technical Institute, a leading workforce education provider for transportation, skilled technicians, electrical, energy, and healthcare, has been recognized for the second time as a Top 20 Workplace in Arizona.

In today’s market, leaders must ensure they’re allowing employees to have a voice and be heard. That’s paramount. Top Workplaces do this, and it pays dividends.”
