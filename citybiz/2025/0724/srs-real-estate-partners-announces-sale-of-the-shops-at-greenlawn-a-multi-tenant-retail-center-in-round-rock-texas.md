# SRS Real Estate Partners Announces Sale of The Shops at Greenlawn, a Multi-Tenant Retail Center in Round Rock, Texas

SRS Real Estate Partners announced today the sale of The Shops at Greenlawn, a 22,970-square-foot retail center located at 3200 Greenlawn Boulevard in Round Rock, TX (Austin MSA).

 SRS Capital Markets Managing Principal Cathy Nabours, Vice President Kyle Shaffer, and Senior Associate Sam Nichols, who are based in Austin, represented the seller, Mathias Partners, an Austin-based investment and development firm. The buyer was an out of state, global real estate investor.

 “SRS secured multiple offers on this 92%-occupied, nine-tenant retail center,” said Nabours. “Demand from investors looking to buy retail assets in strong demographic regions is the highest our team has ever seen – not only in Austin, but also in surrounding Central Texas communities where the construction of new housing subdivisions has far outpaced new retail construction.”

 Shaffer added, “The acquisition of The Shops at Greenlawn represents an ideal purchase in the buyer’s strategy to acquire unanchored high-quality essential service retail centers.”

 The property is located near the headquarters of Dell Computers which recently announced a return to in-person working five days a week. In addition to being across the street from a H-E-B Grocery center, Mark IV Capital broke ground on the adjacent 65-acre future home to The District. This highly anticipated project will be a dynamic & walkable destination for shopping, dining, office and Class A residential units – the project is poised to be Round Rock’s premier regional retail destination.

 The sale of Shops at Greenlawn represents the third multi-tenant shopping center the SRS team has sold in the past three months.

 This year, SRS Capital Markets has completed more than $1.2 billion in deal volume comprised of more than 350 transactions across the nation. SRS currently has in excess of 845 properties actively on the market with a market value surpassing $3.7 billion.
