# Inside Xpansiv’s Climate Week Summit: The Big Conversations Shaping Climate Week 2025

As the world grapples with climate volatility and a surge in data-driven energy demand, the need for intelligent, verifiable climate solutions has never been more urgent. The Xpansiv team is stepping into this moment with its second annual Xpansiv Climate Week Summit, taking place September 22, 2025.

 Climate Week NYC serves as a critical platform for leaders across industries and regions to exchange ideas, identify opportunities, and collaborate on building a more sustainable world.

 Launched in 2024, the Xpansiv summit quickly established itself as a forum for advancing environmental markets, scaling registries, and strengthening market infrastructure – the foundations of resilient economies and a healthier planet. This year’s program builds on that momentum with a full day of discussions exploring how markets, infrastructure, and technology can accelerate climate solutions. Designed for professionals in commodities, finance, and clean energy, the summit will deliver practical insights and candid dialogue to help move climate action forward.

 Breakfast Fireside Chat

 Before the main program begins, the summit will feature a breakfast fireside chat on Global Carbon Market Growth and Infrastructure, with perspectives from NH Investment & Securities and the Korea Exchange. This conversation will cover how Asia is shaping the next phase of carbon trading and how exchanges and institutional investors can help build transparent, liquid markets worldwide.

 Five High-Impact Sessions

 We’ll host five focused sessions, capped by a closing conversation between Xpansiv CEO John Melby and a high-profile guest:

 * Capitalizing the Transition: Financing Physical Impact How investors and project finance leaders are structuring and de-risking large-scale capital for sustainability projects.
* Orchestrating Clean Power: Real-Time Demand, Dispatch, and Data How utilities, hyperscalers, and energy managers are using digital tools and storage to balance soaring demand with clean energy.
* Accelerating Clean Mobility: Fuels, Logistics, and Verifiable Impact How aviation, shipping, and heavy transport are adopting advanced fuels and infrastructure while ensuring verified emissions cuts.
* Living with the Whiplash: Trading Through Climate Volatility How risk managers and market participants are navigating climate-driven volatility and closing gaps in pricing and reliability.
* Digital Foundations: Scaling Trust Through Verifiable Data & Standards How registries, attributes, and digital MRV are building the infrastructure of trust behind credible, scalable markets.

 The Xpansiv Climate Week Summit is designed to create connections, advance real-world opportunities, and spark action among private and public stakeholders, helping them manage emissions programs, grow environmental markets, and maximize clean energy returns and predictability.

 We’re excited to bring together companies such as:

 * Bank of America, Climate Policy Initiative, and leading sovereign and private market investors.
* Constellation, BloombergNEF, utilities, and hyperscalers.
* Infinium, Signature Aviation, logistics and clean fuels innovators.
* Aon, ReSurety, market participants and risk managers.
* Technology providers, global institutions, and standards bodies.

 In 2025, we’ve seen a surge in data center growth, renewed interest in nuclear energy, and continued investment in clean energy expansion. Our summit will unpack how technology, data, and market infrastructure can help organizations thrive in this evolving landscape.
