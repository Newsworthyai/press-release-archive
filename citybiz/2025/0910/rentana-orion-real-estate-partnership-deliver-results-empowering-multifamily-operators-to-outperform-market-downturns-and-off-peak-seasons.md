# Rentana, Orion Real Estate Partnership Deliver Results; Empowering Multifamily Operators to Outperform Market Downturns and Off-Peak Seasons

With seasonal leasing lulls approaching, multifamily leaders are seeking smarter ways to protect revenue while keeping teams lean. Rentana, an AI-powered revenue intelligence platform, is helping owners and operators turn slowdowns into growth opportunities.

 Today, Rentana announced results from its partnership with Orion Real Estate Partners, a tech-forward investment firm. Before adopting the platform, Orion worked through a manual, time-consuming pricing process that was seeing rent decline by 3.5%. Digging through multiple systems and reports to assess pricing was inefficient and proving unsuccessful. Orion needed a way to boost efficiency and portfolio performance without adding headcount.

 After evaluating the revenue management landscape, Orion chose Rentana for its real-time, personalized insights delivered through an intuitive, privacy-first platform. Within just five months, Orion achieved measurable results:

 * Return on Investment: 350% within 5 months
* Faster Pricing Reviews: slashed 6x – from 1 hour to 10 minutes per property per day, leaving more time to find other operational opportunities
* Accelerating Occupancy: increased by 2% enabling greater pricing power

 “With Rentana, we’ve elevated our decision-making to a new level,” said Mark Limpert, Principal at Orion Real Estate Partners. “The platform delivers intelligence and efficiency that allows us to stay ahead of market shifts and focus on driving results across our portfolio.”

 Rentana combines public market data with proprietary portfolio insights to deliver real-time, actionable recommendations. Its AI-powered intelligence allows teams to anticipate market shifts, streamline renewals, and proactively set pricing before seasonal slowdown hits.

 “Leasing lulls don’t have to mean lost revenue,” said Julie Blanc, CEO and Co-Founder of Rentana. “Rentana gives teams personalized and immediate intelligence to move faster, scale smarter, and outperform peers, even in challenging markets.”

 These results are common. Earlier this year, Rentana helped 29th Street Capital drive a $4.6 million valuation boost in just 90 days, outperforming a competing system from an established industry veteran.

 Rentana is redefining revenue management for a new market reality, where owners and operators can scale efficiently, find pricing and occupancy opportunities faster, and outperform peers.
