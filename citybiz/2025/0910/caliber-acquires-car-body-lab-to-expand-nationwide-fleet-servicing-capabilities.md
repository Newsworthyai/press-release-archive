# Caliber Acquires Car Body Lab to Expand Nationwide Fleet Servicing Capabilities

The Caliber family of automotive repair and service brands, including Caliber Collision and Caliber Auto Glass, today announced its acquisition of Car Body Lab, a mobile auto body repair company currently servicing 20 cities across seven states. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, and Car Body Lab will continue to operate as a standalone business. Stephens Inc. served as exclusive financial advisor to Car Body Lab Inc. on its sale to Caliber.

 The strategic acquisition of Car Body Lab is effective immediately and is expected to expand Caliber’s auto body repair capabilities for Caliber Fleet Solutions, a specialized division for auto body and glass repair for large volume fleets and businesses.

 “Caliber is a customer-first business – we’re always focused on excellent service and exceptional customer satisfaction,” said Shawn Hezar, Chief Corporate Development Officer of Caliber. “We want to put our customers back on the road safely and quickly. Car Body Lab helps us expand our commitment to providing the highest value and consistency that fleet managers can depend on and expect from us. We’re thrilled for them to join Caliber, and we look forward to working together to restore the rhythm of our customers’ lives.”

 “This acquisition accelerates the growth of our fleet servicing capabilities as we position Caliber to support the evolving needs of our customers,” said Brent Jones, SVP Operations & Fleet Solutions at Caliber. “This acquisition is a key milestone in our growth strategy as we elevate our ability to reach new consumers and cater to the dynamic needs of businesses and vehicle owners nationwide. Car Body Lab’s addition to the Caliber family equips our national footprint with enhanced digital capabilities that deliver on our mission to be the most trusted automotive services provider in every community we serve.”

 As part of the acquisition, Rudy Joudet, Founder and CEO of Car Body Lab, will join Caliber’s leadership team as a Vice President of Operations.

 “Caliber is a trailblazer when it comes to advancing innovations in the auto body repair industry,” said Mr. Joudet. “As we continue to grow, we are thrilled to join the Caliber family and look forward to leveraging our combined expertise and expanded reach to deliver quality repairs and service excellence with speed and precision.”
