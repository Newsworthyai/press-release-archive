# Ellison’s Fortune Soars on Oracle Surge, Closing Gap With Musk

Larry Ellison, co-founder, chairman, and chief technology officer of Oracle Corp., is approaching Elon Musk’s standing as the world’s richest person, his wealth buoyed by an extraordinary surge in Oracle shares. But Ellison’s asset base extends well beyond Silicon Valley: in recent years, he has assembled a formidable luxury hospitality footprint across South Florida that underscores both his financial might and his vision for high-end real estate.

 Ellison’s net worth vaulted by roughly $70 billion to an estimated $364 billion following Oracle’s blockbuster earnings—just trailing Musk’s estimated $384 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Oracle’s shares rose more than 29% on the day, potentially marking the wealth gauge’s most substantial single-day increase ever.

 Ellison’s soaring Oracle stake might remain the cornerstone of his fortune, but his Florida hospitality empire is becoming an increasingly critical complement. In August 2024, Ellison quietly closed on the Eau Palm Beach Resort & Spa—a storied, 309-room oceanfront property in Manalapan, Florida—paying approximately $277 million through his Lawrence Investments entity . The resort spans eight acres and includes a six-story building with spa facilities, meeting space, restaurants and expansive guest accommodations.

 Originally founded as La Coquille Club in the 1950s—an elite beach retreat for families like the Vanderbilts, Rockefellers, and Fords—the resort later became a Ritz-Carlton before being rebranded as Eau Palm Beach in 2013. Ellison plans further enhancements to elevate the guest experience, while retaining the current management team to ensure continuity

 Beyond the hotel, Ellison owns a private 16-acre estate in Manalapan, purchased for $173 million in 2022—setting a record for the most expensive home sale in Florida history. The property boasts both beachfront and lakefront access, and includes a network of tunnels connecting across A1

 Taken together, Ellison has deployed over $450 million in Manalapan real estate since 2022, setting the stage for the transformation of this small town of roughly 400 residents into an enclave for the ultra-wealthy. The move has catalyzed a broader real estate boom, as more affluent buyers flock to the area—including CEOs, celebrities, and other high-net-worth individuals. Industry observers note Ellison’s investments are reshaping Manalapan’s social and real-estate fabric. Luxury residential listings now stretch into the hundreds of millions of dollars, including a spec mansion listed for as much as $285 million, featuring amenities like bowling alleys, golf simulators and ocean-to-Intracoastal tunnels. Elsewhere in the enclave, even modest estate listings—like a property offered with complimentary membership to Ellison’s resort—carry multimillion-dollar price tags.

 Ellison’s broader hospitality holdings underscore his keen sense of upscale lifestyle trends: he owns or has operated luxury properties such as the Four Seasons Resort Lanai and Sensei Lanai in Hawaii; Nobu Ryokan Malibu and Nobu Hotel Palo Alto; the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe; and Sensei Porcupine Creek in California.

 As Oracle shares continue to climb and his hospitality investments deepen, Ellison’s net worth and influence extend well beyond software and servers—rooting him in a curated world of private estates, legendary hotels, and luxury enclaves that may ultimately eclipse even his tech fortunes.
