# Woodleigh Singers Perform for Friends and Neighbors

By Danielle Rexrode

 Summer was still in full swing when the Woodleigh Singers began rehearsing for their upcoming holiday concert. Clearly, the resident-led choir at Woodleigh Chase, an Erickson Senior Living community in Fairfax, Va., likes to be prepared!

 Resident Bobbie Bragg, who started Woodleigh Singers in September 2024 soon after the community opened, now serves as director.

 “When I moved to Woodleigh Chase, I discovered that various groups were forming, but there was nothing music related. As a vocal teacher, I thought it would be nice to start a choral group,” says Bobbie, who taught the Women of Note, a women’s choral group at Heritage Hunt Country Club in Gainesville, Va., for 14 years.   A range of music The 21-member mixed choir now holds annual spring and winter concerts.

 Last spring’s concert included a mixture of songs like “Colors of the Wind” from the musical Pocahontas and “The Night Will Be Filled with Music,” based on the poem The Day Is Done by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

 The Woodleigh Singers practice every Wednesday around the piano in the lounge of Emerson Square, the community’s spacious clubhouse. And Kathy Dunkerley is always happy to accompany the group.

 “When we moved to Woodleigh Chase in July 2024, I was interested in being part of a choral group. I wanted to sing or play piano, however they could use me,” says Kathy, who began playing piano at the age of four and continued her studies through college, earning a degree in music education.

 She continues, “As it turned out, they really needed an accompanist, so that’s what I volunteered to do. It’s a lot of fun! We have a core group, and we hope that as the community grows, more people will join us.”

 Practice, practice, practice Tenor Don Greenwood joined the Woodleigh Singers immediately after moving to Woodleigh Chase in 2024.

 “It’s a lot of fun for me because it’s different from what I usually do,” says Don, who has performed around Fairfax with Encore ROCKS, an ensemble specializing in rock and roll hits from the 50s, 60s, and beyond.

 Don is responsible for sending a practice guide via email to the Woodleigh Singers so they can easily rehearse on their own. “YouTube features live performances of many of the songs that we perform, and publishers also share their own arrangements, which are helpful,” he explains. “We are like fledglings learning to fly. Even if we make mistakes during rehearsal, we remain laser-focused when it comes time to perform.”

 No experience needed Although prior experience is not required to join the Woodleigh Singers, Bobbie notes that prior experience singing with a church or community choir is helpful, and the ability to read music is a bonus.

 “It’s nice if you have experience singing in a choir. It makes things a little easier,” says Bobbie. “But if you don’t have any experience, and you like to sing and are willing to put in the work, we would love to have you join us!”

 From the moment Woodleigh Chase opened its doors, residents have enjoyed exploring new hobbies and pursuing their passions.

 In addition to the Woodleigh Singers, residents have formed clubs like the Family History Group, Short Story Discussion Group, and Women’s Wine Wednesday social group. The weekly calendar at Woodleigh Chase is packed with opportunities for card games, movies, yoga, pickleball, tai chi, and gardening–just to name a few.

 ‘A great group’ Bobbie, hard at work preparing for their concert in December, says she is proud of what they have accomplished so far and looks forward to watching the group flourish as the community grows.

 “I admire the people who joined and have stuck with it,” says Bobbie. “It’s a great group; I love their dedication and enthusiasm!”
