# Windsor Run Introduces Custom Homes

By Kelly Shue

 Windsor Run, an Erickson Senior Living community in Matthews, N.C., is pleased to announce the introduction of ten new two-bedroom, two-bath floor plans!

 These unique homes, offered in the Park View residence building, are the result of combining two existing units into one spacious design. Ranging in size from 1,380 to 2,048 square feet, they feature open living areas, large primary suites, and additional storage space.

 “The construction of these new homes is the direct result of Priority List demand,” says Sales Director Ryan Barkley. “Even with the arrival of our final two residence buildings, there is still an extended wait for our popular two-bedroom homes. The introduction of these new combination residences provides the unique opportunity to enjoy a spacious home without the long wait.”

 Brenda and Rick West were among the Priority List members who first received news of these residences–and ultimately decided to claim one for themselves.

 “We were getting tired of maintaining our house and yard and growing increasingly worried about going up and down steps,” says Brenda. “Windsor Run’s worry-free lifestyle really appealed to us.”

 Priority List perks They joined the Priority List, which gave them exclusive opportunities to attend informational luncheons, participate in the Live the Life program, and more.

 “Once we joined the Priority List, we visited Windsor Run more regularly,” says Rick. “We really enjoyed the opportunities to sit down with other prospective residents for a meal. Every time we did so, we ended up talking for hours with someone new.”

 The couple also decided to sign up for a Live the Life stay, enjoying a “test drive” of the community’s engaging lifestyle. Rick and Brenda joined current residents for dinner; took part in activities that interested them, including a game of chair volleyball; and explored the 60-acre campus at their own pace.

 “We had a lot of fun, especially playing chair volleyball,” says Rick. “We also really enjoyed meeting residents. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming.”

 A unique opportunity Sold on everything Windsor Run has to offer, the Wests sat down to discuss their floor plan options with Sales Counselor Matt Mooney.

 “Matt shared with us that, even with the construction of the final two residential buildings, the wait for a two-bedroom home is quite long,” says Brenda. “But he also had good news, telling us about the new ‘combo’ homes coming. He asked us if we were interested.”

 The couple jumped at the opportunity. “We thought it was a great option and discovered that this new ‘combo’ apartment was even bigger than the apartment home we were waiting for,” says Rick. The Wests’ combination home will feature a large living room, two bedrooms on opposite ends of the residence, a den, and a screened porch.

 “Rick and I enjoy working on lots of jigsaw puzzles, and the den will be a perfect place to do that,” says Brenda. “I also really like the big laundry room and the additional areas for storage.”

 Planning ahead To plan for their upcoming move, Brenda and Rick are working with Planning and Moving Consultant Andrea Fitzgibbons and some of Windsor Run’s preferred vendors–another perk of their Priority List membership.

 “The help we are receiving in preparation of our move has been amazing,” says Brenda. Before they decided on a floor plan, Fitzgibbons visited their house to measure the furniture they wanted to take with them and helped them envision their future living space by putting together a preliminary plan.

 “That was extremely helpful. When we changed our plans and chose the ‘combo’ apartment home, she put together a new plan,” adds Brenda.

 The Wests are also meeting with senior move managers and movers, all recommended by Fitzgibbons based on their track records of top-notch customer service.

 “Every step of the way, they’ve made us feel comfortable and free to ask any questions,” says Brenda. “They are great to work with, always providing information while never being pushy.”

 Don’t wait! With only a handful of combination residences available, Barkley encourages anyone considering them to act now.

 And Rick offers this advice: “For us, one of the best things we did was join the Priority List. We’ve enjoyed many benefits, including learning about our new home. It’s been wonderful for us. We are very excited to start our new life at Windsor Run.”
