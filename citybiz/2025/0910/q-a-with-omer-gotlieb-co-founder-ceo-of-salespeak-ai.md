# Q&amp;A with Omer Gotlieb, Co-Founder &amp; CEO of Salespeak.ai

Omer Gotlieb is the Co-Founder and CEO of Salespeak.ai, the company transforming static B2B websites into intelligent, expert-led sales engines. A second-time founder, Omer previously co-founded Totango, one of the first customer success platforms, where he led go-to-market strategy for over a decade before the company’s acquisition by private equity.

 Drawing on his experience as a seller, buyer, founder, and executive, Omer launched Salespeak to fix what he calls the “broken” B2B buying process—where generic forms, SDR bottlenecks, and outdated funnels frustrate buyers and stall revenue. Under his leadership, Salespeak has introduced the AI Sales Brain, a real-time conversational layer that engages visitors with expert-level answers, qualifies intent, and delivers actionable insights to GTM teams.

 Omer is passionate about category creation and has spent his career at the intersection of technology, customer experience, and go-to-market innovation.

 Omer, let’s start at the beginning. What’s your background, and how did it shape the idea for Salespeak?

 I’m a second-time founder. My first company was Totango, one of the earliest customer success platforms. I led its go-to-market strategy for 12 years before we sold to private equity. That journey gave me many lessons and a lot of perspective, because I wasn’t just building software, I was helping create an entire category. Along the way, I played every role: seller, buyer, executive, business owner. And across all those perspectives, I kept hitting the same wall: the B2B sales process was fundamentally broken.

 What do you mean by “broken”? Why are today’s B2B websites failing buyers?

 Websites have become bottlenecks and friction points. A CMO might spend millions driving traffic to their site, only to greet visitors with static pages, generic calls-to-action, or the dreaded “Request a Demo” button. Click it, and you’re routed to a Sales Development Representative (SDR) who knows less about your problem than you do. It’s a flawed experience. Buyers want answers now, not in four days on a scheduled call. They’re already using AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude to get instant, intelligent answers. So when they hit a website that feels stuck in 2015, it’s jarring. That mismatch is why conversion rates are so low.

 So what led you to build Salespeak?

 When ChatGPT launched, I asked it about my previous company, Totango, and it explained the product better than some junior reps could. That was an aha moment. If AI could already deliver more clarity than a human, what would happen if we trained it deeply on a company’s actual content and knowledge base? Salespeak was born from that realization. The goal isn’t to replace sales teams, it’s to make the buying experience intelligent from the very first interaction.

 What makes Salespeak different from chatbots or legacy inbound tools?

 I don’t even like the word “chatbot.” It implies something shallow and scripted. Salespeak is what we call an “AI Sales Brain.” It’s trained on your product documentation, customer stories, pricing, and competitive intel, and it can hold a founder-level conversation 24/7. It doesn’t just answer questions; it guides the journey, calculates buyer intent, and surfaces insights for your GTM team in Slack and CRM. Think of it as putting your best AE, SE, and product marketer on your homepage without the wait.

 How does Salespeak benefit both buyers and sellers?

 For buyers, it’s about trust and speed. They get instant, expert-level answers to their questions, whether it’s pricing, integrations, or competitive comparisons, without waiting for a demo call or navigating 20 tabs of content. That creates confidence and keeps momentum. For sellers, it’s about insight and efficiency. Every conversation surfaces what buyers actually care about, from features to objections, and feeds that back into Slack and CRM. That means shorter sales cycles, smarter campaigns, and a clearer picture of intent. In short, buyers feel served, and sellers get smarter.

 What kind of results are your customers seeing?

 Engagement rates are 3–5x higher than legacy chat tools. One customer went from 8% to 50% conversion after switching. Another closed $380K in pipeline last quarter with meetings booked overnight. What’s just as powerful are the insights: customers learn which campaigns drive the wrong traffic, which competitor prospects ask about most, and where messaging gaps exist. One CMO told me, “We appear more tech-forward; it’s a credibility builder”.

 You’ve said trust is a big issue in AI. How do you address that?

 That’s the number one pushback: “Can I trust an AI in front of my customers?” My answer is that many companies already put a 23-year-old SDR, fresh out of college, with no training, on the front lines. That person is far more likely to “hallucinate” than our AI. The difference is that with Salespeak, you can monitor, adjust, and retrain instantly. Trust is built not only in accuracy but in responsiveness, transparency, and the ability to improve continuously.

 How do you see the role of sales teams changing in this new era?

 I don’t frame Salespeak as a cost-cutting tool. It’s not about firing reps. It’s about shifting their role. The skill set of sales is changing, from cold-calling and form-chasing to guiding, educating, and closing once the buyer has already self-qualified through AI-driven interactions. The companies that adapt their teams to this new reality will win. The ones that don’t will keep losing buyers upstream.

 You’ve talked about the future being AI-to-AI. What does that look like?

 Today, people still come to your website. Tomorrow, their AI agents will come instead. They’ll ask, “Which vendor is the best fit for me?” and expect an instant, contextual answer. If your site isn’t AI-readable or doesn’t provide structured, intelligent responses, you won’t even be in the consideration set. That’s why we built Salespeak, to prepare companies for a world where the first sales conversation happens between two AIs.

 What’s your ultimate goal for Salespeak?

 In 2025, my goal is simple: be on as many websites as possible. Not because of revenue targets, but because this change is coming fast. Just like it became unthinkable 20 years ago to run a business without a website, soon it will be unthinkable to run one without an intelligent, AI-powered buying experience. I want Salespeak to be the infrastructure for that shift.

 On a personal note, what motivates you as a second-time founder?

 I love building categories. At Totango, we helped make customer success an industry. Now, with Salespeak, I see the same opportunity to reshape B2B buying. What motivates me is the chance to fix a broken experience, not just with technology, but with a philosophy: buyer-first, not process-first. And on the lighter side, flying. I got my pilot’s license after Totango. Flying teaches you humility, focus, and adaptability, all things a founder needs.
