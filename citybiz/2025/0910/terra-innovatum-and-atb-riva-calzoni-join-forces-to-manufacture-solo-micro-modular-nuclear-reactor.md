# Terra Innovatum and ATB Riva Calzoni Join Forces to Manufacture SOLO Micro-Modular Nuclear Reactor

* Partnership establishes a comprehensive multi-phase collaboration for manufacturing of first-of-a-kind SOLO micro-modular nuclear reactor and preparation for serialization and industrialization by 2028
* Major milestone in Terra Innovatum’s path to commercializing and deploying its SOLO micro-modular reactors at scale, marking a transformative step in the company’s clean energy mission
* ATB Riva Calzoni brings leading heavy equipment engineering and manufacturing expertise, a deep global presence, and a proven history of servicing major U.S. and European nuclear companies

 Terra Innovatum Srl, a developer of micro-modular nuclear reactors, and GSR III Acquisition Corp. (Nasdaq: GSRT), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company, today announced Terra Innovatum has signed a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) with ATB Riva Calzoni, a global supplier and manufacturer of nuclear components, for the preparation, development, and production of Terra Innovatum’s SOLOTM micro-modular nuclear reactor.

 “Signing this MOU with ATB is a major inflection point as we move closer to making the first commercial deployment of the SOLO micro-modular reactor a reality,” said Alessandro Petruzzi, CEO of Terra Innovatum. “Our shared commitment to quality and innovation will enable us to deliver reliable, affordable clean energy where it’s needed most, quickly and at scale.”

 Giordano Morichi – Partner, Chief Business Development Officer & Investor Relations continued: “This collaboration is a testament to Terra Innovatum’s vision and the tangible market momentum behind our advanced nuclear solution. With a leading manufacturing partner in place, already serving several nuclear leaders and colossal industry manufacturers, our path forward is clear, de-risked, and we are confident in deploying SOLO to by our target of 2028.”

 Francesco Squaratti, Managing Director, ATB Riva Calzoni added: “We are proud to support the development and manufacturing of Terra Innovatum’s SOLO reactor and to partner on a project that delivers a reliable and safe energy solution. Combining ATB’s century-long legacy in complex energy infrastructure with Terra Innovatum’s micro-modular technology will help set new benchmarks in safety, performance, and sustainability for the nuclear industry.”

 ATB Riva Calzoni brings a heavy international presence – with deep operations in Europe and South America and offices across the U.S., Canada, Africa, and Australia – and a proven track record of supplying leading nuclear and energy companies worldwide. Many major U.S. and European players already rely on Italian manufacturers for critical components, and this partnership strengthens the Company’s manufacturing capabilities as it advances SOLO toward commercialization.

 The framework for collaboration marks a breakthrough for the Company’s commercialization journey, unlocking the manufacturing scale and expertise needed to deliver the SOLO micro-modular reactor from concept to commercial reality. The multi-phase collaboration agreement supports SOLO development by advancing component readiness and accelerating production scale-up to deliver a market-ready clean energy solution that positions Terra Innovatum for commercial launch.

 Under the MOU, Terra Innovatum and ATB will work closely to conduct joint feasibility studies and advance component design, safety evaluations, engineering validation, and regulatory and project risk assessments. At commercialization stage, ATB is expected to lead component manufacturing and commissioning of SOLOTM and support commercial production and manufacturing at scale.

 ABOUT TERRA INNOVATUM & SOLOTM Terra Innovatum’s mission is to make nuclear power accessible. We deliver simple and safe micro-reactor solutions that are scalable, affordable and deployable anywhere 1 MWe at a time.

 Terra Innovatum is a pioneering force in the energy sector, dedicated to delivering innovative and sustainable power solutions. Terra Innovatum plans to leverage cutting-edge nuclear technology through the SOLO Micro-Modular Reactor (SMR) to provide efficient, safe, and environmentally conscious energy. With a mission to address global energy shortages, Terra Innovatum combines extensive expertise in nuclear industry design, manufacturing, and installation licensing to offer disruptive energy solutions. Committed to propelling technological advancements, Terra Innovatum and SOLO are dedicated to fostering prosperity and sustainability for humankind.

 It is anticipated that SOLO will be available globally within the next three years. Conceptualized in 2018 and engineered over six years by experts in nuclear safety, licensing, innovation, and R&D, SOLO addresses pressing global energy demands with a market-ready solution. Built from readily available commercial off-the-shelf components, the proven licensing path for SOLO enables rapid deployment and minimizes supply chain risks, ensuring final cost predictability. Designed to adapt with evolving fuel options, SOLO supports both LEU+ and HALEU, offering a platform ready to transition to future fuel supplies.

 SOLO will offer a wide range of versatile applications, providing CO2-free, behind-the-meter, and off-grid power solutions for data centers, mini-grids serving remote towns and villages, and large-scale industrial operations in hard-to-abate sectors like cement production, oil and gas, steel manufacturing, and mining. It also has the ability to supply heat for industrial applications and other specialized processes, including water treatment, desalination and co-generation. Thanks to its modular design, SOLO can easily scale to deliver up to 1GW or more of CO2-free power with a minimal footprint, making it an ideal solution for rapidly replacing fossil fuel-based thermal plants. Beyond electricity and heat generation, SOLO can also contribute to critical applications in the medical sector by producing radioisotopes essential for oncology research and cancer treatment.
