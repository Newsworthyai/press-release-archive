# Western Retail Advisors Brings Ridgeview Plaza in Mesa, AZ to 100% Leased

In just under a year, Phoenix-based retail brokerage specialist Western Retail Advisors has completed a series of new leases to bring Ridgeview Plaza in north Mesa, to 100% leased.

 Located on more than 12 acres at 2920 N. Power Rd., Ridgeview Plaza totals more than 124,000 square feet, situated immediately north of McDowell Road and just west of the Loop 202 freeway

 The newest tenants to commit to the center include The Greek Spot, Action Ride Shop, Lion Shield Barbershop and the first Arizona location of Hear Again America. They join a host of existing center tenants including project anchor Bashas’, Ace Hardware, Big 5 Sporting Goods, Pet Planet, Starbucks, Subway, Orangetheory, Leslie’s Pool Supply, Nekter and more.

 As Ridgeview Plaza’s exclusive leasing team, Western Retail Advisors brokers Bryan Ledbetter, Bryan Babits, Katie Weeks and Leslie Araujo represented property owner Furst Jacobs LLC in all transactions.

 “Ridgeview Plaza is surrounded by upscale north Mesa neighborhoods offering exceptional demographics. This, combined with direct Loop 202 access, makes the project a magnet for high-quality tenants,” said Ledbetter. “What began as an introductory phone call to Furst Jacobs has grown into a long-term partnership across multiple, thriving centers – each reflecting the strength of our relationship and the strength of the market.”

 In addition to Ridgeview Plaza, the Western Retail Advisors team has also 100% leased Highlands Village shopping center. Owned by the same investor and also anchored by Bashas’, it sits at 1143 N. Ellsworth Rd., at the southeast corner of Ellsworth and Brown roads.

 Collectively, the properties underscore the strength of the North Mesa submarket, with rent, population and demand all continuing to rise.
