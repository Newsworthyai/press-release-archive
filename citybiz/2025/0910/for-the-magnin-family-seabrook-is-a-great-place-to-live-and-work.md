# For the Magnin Family, Seabrook is a Great Place to Live and Work

When Byron and Alice Magnin were looking to simplify their life with a retirement move, Seabrook, an Erickson Senior Living community in Tinton Falls, N.J., was at the top of their list.

 Not only was it close by, but the community was heartily endorsed by some people they’re very close to–their son, Brian Magnin, is Seabrook’s facilities manager, and their daughter-in-law, Melanie Magnin, works as the community’s trips coordinator.

 But Byron and Alice are not the only family members of staff who live at Seabrook.

 “Seabrook offers a vibrant, engaging lifestyle, so it’s no surprise that our employees want their family members to live here!” says Sales Director Brian Cassidy. “Plus, as a staff member, you personally know the people who are caring for residents every day. There’s comfort in knowing they are providing great care for their family members.”

 High marks Brian and Melanie have both enjoyed long careers at Seabrook and have seen firsthand how the amenities and services offered at the community benefit residents’ lives.

 So, when they got word that Byron and Alice were researching retirement communities, they brought sales materials home to help them learn more about the community.

 Byron and Alice were very receptive. “We wanted all of our living space to be on one level. We wanted to find a place where we would be comfortable getting around and not have to worry about upkeep,” explains Alice, who was drawn to Seabrook’s one-level, maintenance-free homes.

 Alice and Byron also had their own wonderful experiences with the community, which positively impacted their decision.

 Byron had spent seven enjoyable years working in Seabrook’s security department before he retired in 2016. Alice, a former nurse, often referred patients to Seabrook as part of the care management process.

 “We already knew how great Seabrook was,” she says. “I checked out a lot of different facilities for my patients and clients, so I knew all about assisted living, nursing homes, rehab care, and independent living. I knew from my professional background that Seabrook was the best choice in Monmouth County.”

 Glowing reviews from other people they knew further cemented their decision.

 “We have friends who are here who raved about the benefits of living at Seabrook,” Alice adds. “That added to the praise we heard from Melanie and Brian.”

 Out and about Alice and Byron moved to Seabrook in July 2024, just two months after meeting with the sales team. Now, they savor made-to-order meals at the different restaurants on campus and take strolls around the beautifully landscaped grounds. The couple also enjoys having convenient access to a state-of-the-art fitness center and indoor swimming pool with lap lanes.

 Byron, who joined the woodworking club, is making his mark on Seabrook through his craftmanship. Recently, he built and painted cubby blocks for resident use and is ready to volunteer on additional projects.

 Alice visits the community’s outpatient therapy office several times a week for physical therapy.

 “The therapists are phenomenal!” she shares. “I’ve been to other PTs outside of the community, and the therapists at Seabrook truly are the best. My doctor is thrilled that I’m coming here for therapy. They really care for their patients and equip us with all of the information we need.”

 A special place While the Magnins appreciate having so many amenities and services just a short stroll away, they love coming home to their one-bedroom residence, which overlooks the community’s charming courtyard.

 “Chance was on their side when they walked the campus and decided on that home,” Brian says. “Their view of that inner courtyard is just stunning, especially during the warmer months when everything is in bloom.”

 Brian is happy his parents found the perfect home for them, but what he’s most grateful for is that they are enjoying the vibrant, worry-free retirement they’ve always wanted.

 “Seabrook is the perfect place for my parents to enjoy life. Everything they need is right here,” he says. “I sleep better at night because I know that anything that they could possibly need is provided here at Seabrook. I know the team is going to take care of them. To me, that’s priceless.”
