# pgEdge Unveils pgEdge Enterprise Postgres Alongside Full Commitment to Open Source

pgEdge, the leading open source enterprise Postgres company, today announced two major milestones: the release of pgEdge Enterprise Postgres, and the company’s full transition to an open source licensing model for its distributed Postgres components and future Postgres-based technologies.

 While pgEdge is widely recognized as a technology leader in distributed PostgreSQL—with successful deployments powering mission-critical systems for some of the world’s leading enterprises—today’s announcement expands its offering to include support for both distributed and non-distributed PostgreSQL applications, all fully based on standard PostgreSQL.

 pgEdge Enterprise Postgres is an enterprise-grade PostgreSQL distribution built, packaged and supported by pgEdge. It provides organizations with the reliability, manageability, and enterprise-class support they need to scale PostgreSQL across demanding workloads.

 Key features include:

 * High availability for both distributed and non-distributed workloads
* Full support for PostgreSQL v16, v17, and soon v18
* Enterprise-ready extensions including pgAudit, pgBackrest, pgBouncer, PostGIS, and pgVector
* Browser and desktop-based management and monitoring with pgAdmin
* pgEdge distributed-ready components, including the Spock multi-master logical replication extension, Large Object Logical Replication (LOLOR) extension, and Snowflake Sequences
* Native packages for VMs and bare metal, containers for Kubernetes, OpenShift, and Docker/Docker Swarm, plus managed service availability via pgEdge Cloud

 Uniquely, pgEdge enables organizations to scale seamlessly: from a single Postgres instance to high availability with read replicas and Patroni, to globally distributed Postgres deployments spanning multiple regions for extreme uptime and low latency.

 Concurrently, pgEdge is also announcing that all pgEdge Distributed Postgres components are now fully open source, licensed under the standard PostgreSQL License approved by the Open Source Initiative. This includes the Spock, LOLOR, and Snowflake extensions. Previously released under the pgEdge Community License, these projects are now re-licensed under one of the most permissive open source licenses in the industry and are all available on Github.

 “Customers have asked us to deliver and support enterprise-class Postgres for their non-distributed workloads, and we listened,” said Phillip Merrick, Co-founder and CEO of pgEdge. “The market is clear: organizations want fully standard, fully open source Postgres to power their most critical applications. pgEdge is proud to provide enterprise-grade Postgres solutions that scale with our customers’ needs—while reinforcing our long-term commitment to open source and the Postgres community.”

 “I’m pleased to say that all the core components of pgEdge Distributed Postgres, along with other pgEdge public repositories, have now been re-licenced under the permissive PostgreSQL License, as approved by the Open Source Initiative,” said Dave Page, VP of Engineering at pgEdge and PostgreSQL Core Team member. “We’re proud to be able to make this change to support open source software and contribute to the PostgreSQL ecosystem, and I’m looking forward to seeing us continue to expand our contributions.”

 Product Availability

 pgEdge Enterprise Postgres VM Edition is available immediately as part of a paid subscription, which includes tested builds, security updates, and 24x7x365 enterprise support. pgEdge Enterprise Container Edition with support for Kubernetes Operator will be available in Q4. The packages are supported on a variety of operating systems, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux v9 and v10, and derivatives including Rocky, AlmaLinux, and Oracle Enterprise Linux, with support for Ubuntu and Debian coming later in Q3. Optional services include dedicated Forward Deployed Engineer support, already trusted by pgEdge’s Global 2000 and major government customers—who rate the company’s support with an unprecedented Net Promoter Score of 100.

 With today’s announcement, pgEdge strengthens its position as the open source enterprise Postgres company, offering the flexibility for organizations to start small, grow reliably, and scale globally all while staying fully aligned with the PostgreSQL community.
