 * Medical Weight Loss

 The new Serotonin in Charleston is locally owned by Julia and Peter Sheehan, who have made Charleston their home since 2017. Julia has a background as a middle school English teacher and elementary special education teacher before dedicating time to raising their children, with wellness being a top priority. Peter has spent his career in the hospitality industry for over a decade, specializing in hotel consulting. Their life-long passion for wellness and long-term health led them to Serotonin, where they aim to help others achieve optimal well-being. The couple are energized to kick off growth in the area, with this being the first of three Serotonin locations set to open in the greater Charleston market.

 

 “We believe that wellness is a journey, not a destination, and we’re honored to be the first Serotonin location in the area to offer a space where people can truly focus on their long-term health,” said Julia Sheehan. “Charleston has always been such a welcoming community with open arms, and we can’t wait to help our community feel their best.”

 Each center staffs licensed medical practitioners and personal health coaches that work one-on-one with each member to design personalized prescriptive health plans. This empowers clients to take control of their health needs and work directly with their provider. Services focus on four main modalities – hormone optimization, aesthetic enhancement, weight control, and immunity – to help optimize the health and happiness of members, who are guided along by Serotonin’s team of experts at every juncture of their unique health journey.

 Aiming to rapidly expand into new markets across the U.S., Serotonin Centers is positioned to lead the MedSpa and anti-aging industries as demand in the sector continues to flourish. The opening of the brand’s new location in Charleston marks the next step in its continued expansion.
