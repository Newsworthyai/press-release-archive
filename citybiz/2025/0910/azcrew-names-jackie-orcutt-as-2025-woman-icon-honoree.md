# AZCREW Names Jackie Orcutt as 2025 Woman ICON Honoree

Leading networking organization Arizona Commercial Real Estate Women (AZCREW) has named 18-year industry veteran and CBRE Executive Vice President Jackie Orcutt as its 2025 Woman ICON honoree. Established by AZCREW in 2024, the ICON award honors a trailblazing woman in commercial real estate who has applied exceptional leadership and innovation to pave the way for future generations.

 This year’s award will be presented to Orcutt at AZCREW’s annual signature Woman ICON event, being held September 16, 2025 from 4:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. at the Phoenix Art Museum.

 The event will also feature pilot, reporter, author and acclaimed keynote speaker Amelia Rose Earhart, as well as the announcement of the inaugural Rising ICON Scholarship recipient.

 Established by AZCREW and 2024 Woman ICON honoree Beth Jo Zeitzer, founder, CEO and designated broker of R.O.I Properties, the Rising ICON Scholarship provides $5,000 for an individual wishing to build or transition into a career in CRE brokerage. Open to recent college graduates entering the industry and current professionals looking to make a career change, the scholarship offers funds for licenses, prep courses, exams and other professional development expenses.

 “An ICON is someone whose leadership, vision and impact leave a lasting mark on their industry and inspire others to rise,” said AZCREW President Lynette Dreitz Fort with Cawley Architects. “Jackie exemplifies this through her trailblazing career, unwavering commitment to excellence and dedication to empowering women in commercial real estate. Beth Jo does the same by offering tangible support to those looking to take the next step in their career. We are so grateful for the contributions of both of these women and look forward to celebrating them at our 2025 Woman ICON event.”

 Serving as Executive Vice President in CBRE’s Industrial & Logistics group, Orcutt has a proven track record of success, in the last decade completing more than 82 million square feet of transactions valued at over $2.1 billion as she represents institutional landlords, investors and tenants,

 This has earned Orcutt top producer status at CBRE along with a host of other recognitions including AZ Business Magazine’s Top 20 Most Influential Women in Arizona, Commercial Executives Woman in Power and AZRE Magazine’s 40 Under 40. She is an active member of SIOR, sits on the Board of Directors for Positive Paths and actively serves for PANDA, a volunteer-driven organization funding medical research for children.

 Within AZCREW, Jackie is a graduate of the CREW Network Leadership Certificate Program, has held multiple committee chair positions and served for six years as a Board of Directors member. This was followed by serving as the AZCREW Chapter President in 2017 and as a Director on CREW’s Global Board of Directors in 2019 and 2020.

 “Being a part of the CREW community has been one of the most meaningful experiences of my career. It was the first professional organization I joined and it did not let me down. The women I’ve met here are trailblazers, colleagues, and friends who have challenged me, supported me and inspired me to grow, and I’ve tried to repay those gifts in kind,” said Orcutt. “Receiving the Woman ICON recognition is not just a personal honor, but a celebration of what we’ve accomplished together. It reinforces my belief that when women champion each other, we create lasting change for everyone.”

 In addition to honoring Orcutt and announcing the Rising ICON Scholarship, the 2025 Woman ICON event will feature keynote speaker Amelia Rose Earhart, a former television news anchor and reporter, and the first person to pilot a single-engine Pilatus PC-12-NG around the world in a recreation of the flight of her namesake.

 The experience led to Earhart’s creation of the Fly with Amelia Foundation, a nonprofit fostering the next generation of women in aviation, and success as a speaker who engages audiences ranging from Fortune 500s to the United States Air Force Academy with insight on how we lead, work as teams and stay agile amid the turbulence of everyday life. Most recently, Earhart authored the book Learn to Love the Turbulence: Flight Lessons on Becoming the Pilot in Command of Your Own Journey.

 Tickets for the 2025 Woman ICON event are on sale now. Cost is $175 for AZCREW members and $200 for non-members, and includes registration, networking, appetizers and cocktails beginning at 4:00 p.m. The event program begins at 5:00 p.m., followed by networking.
