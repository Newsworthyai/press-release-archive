# Boutique Pet Salon Concept Opens in Nashville’s Pet-Friendly The Nations

Woofie’s on the Spot–a new pet salon business concept–held its grand opening on Saturday, August 29 in the pet-friendly The Nations in Nashville. Owner and Entrepreneur Eric Wanner draws on experience ranging from startups to Fortune 500 leadership roles and is also owner of Woofie’s® of SE Nashville, celebrating its one-year anniversary. Woofie’s on the Spot is a boutique-style pet salon concept combining spa-worthy pampering with walk-in convenience for pets. Clients can stroll local shops, grab lunch, or hit the local dog bar while their pets enjoy a little “me time.”

Parked in the vibrant, dog-loving shopping district of The Nations (at 5704 Ohio Avenue), Woofie’s on the Spot offers everything from quick touch-ups (nail trims, blowouts, facials, and more) to full-on grooming glow-ups, all delivered in a calm, one-on-one setting that’s as relaxing for pets as it is for their humans.

 “We created Woofie’s on the Spot because our clients wanted the best of both worlds,” said Eric Wanner, local owner of Woofie’s of SE Nashville. “We’re proud to offer mobile pet care that comes to you — and now a central spot to drop in when you’re already out and about. Whether you’re swinging by for an express grooming service or booking a full spa experience, we’ve got you covered.”

 The new location expands on the business’s successful mobile service, which launched last year and quickly became a favorite among busy pet parents in metro Nashville and surrounding communities. Woofie’s of SE Nashville has already earned a 4.9-star Google rating with over 100 glowing reviews, thanks in large part to its skilled, AKC S.A.F.E.®-certified grooming team and a deep commitment to pet safety, care, and comfort.

 “Launching the first-of-its-kind Woofie’s on the Spot salon is a proud milestone,” says Eric. “We’ve seen incredible demand for pet services that feel both high-end and approachable. Through using resources and equipment already available to us, this new concept lets us meet pet parents where they are — whether that’s at home or out shopping with their pup.”

 Services Offered

 Woofie’s on the Spot offers both appointments and walk-ins, with a 30-minute pickup window and a firm commitment to personalized, one-on-one grooming care. Whether you’re stopping by for a glow-up or planning your pup’s next spa day, the Woofie’s team is ready to pamper your pet.
