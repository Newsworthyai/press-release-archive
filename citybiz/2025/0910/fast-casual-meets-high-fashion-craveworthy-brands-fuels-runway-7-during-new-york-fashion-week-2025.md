# Fast Casual Meets High Fashion: Craveworthy Brands Fuels Runway 7 During New York Fashion Week 2025

Innovative restaurant platform, Craveworthy Brands, is an official sponsor of Runway 7 during New York Fashion Week (NYFW), from September 10 to 14, 2025, at Sony Hall.

 As part of the partnership, Craveworthy will serve more than 1,200 meals throughout the event to designers, models and production teams working behind the scenes – bringing the world of fast casual dining to one of fashion’s most iconic stages.

 Four standout Craveworthy brands will be featured, each offering a distinctive culinary experience:

 * Dirty Dough: Decadent, layered chocolate chip cookies that embody creativity and personality, delivering sweet moments of indulgence.

 * Sigri Indian BBQ: Authentic Indian street food such as samosas, paneer and chicken tikka prepared over smokey grills, bringing depth, tradition and global perspective to NYFW.
* Taim Mediterranean Kitchen: Fresh plates with chicken shawarma and falafel, crafted for balance, nourishment and vibrant flavor: fueling talent with all dietary preferences in mind.
* Wing It On!: Championship-winning chicken wings and bold sauces that match the energy and adrenaline of Fashion Week.

 “Fashion and food are both cultural powerhouses,” said Gregg Majewski, Founder and CEO of Craveworthy Brands. “Runway 7 allows us to showcase how fast casual concepts fuel mutual creativity and can be a bridge between the worlds of culture, cuisine and couture.”

 Runway 7 has become one of the fastest-growing showcases at New York Fashion Week, presenting over 600 designers from more than 30 countries since 2020. Known for its cultural diversity and global influence, it brings together fashion, art, music and brand experiences under one roof.

 The collaboration highlights Craveworthy’s broader strategy to integrate its concepts into cultural platforms beyond dining. From sports arenas to music festivals and now the runway, Craveworthy is helping shape how hospitality becomes part of the lifestyle conversation – inspiring creativity, celebrating imagination and connecting people.

 “Each of our brands brings something unique to the table, just like every designer on the runway,” added VP of Culinary and Supply Chain, Jax Sperling. “Like fashion, food is an art form. Every flavor, texture and detail matters. At NYFW, our goal is to fuel those creatives with dishes as thoughtfully crafted as the collections they bring to life.”

 With five days, four brands, and thousands of meals to be shared, Craveworthy and Runway 7 come together around one vision: food and fashion unite people through creativity and culture.
