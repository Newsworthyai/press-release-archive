# Singles Social Group Connects Priority List Members at The Grandview

By Gregory J. Alexander

 When Sandy Winnick decided to move to The Grandview, an Erickson Senior Living community coming to Bethesda, Md., later this year, she was especially excited about the opportunity to meet new people.

 “Many of my friends have moved away to be near their children and grandchildren, so I was looking forward to meeting and making new friends,” says Sandy, who wondered if she could get the ball rolling early.

 During a meeting with Sales Director George Mishraky, she suggested starting a club for single Priority List members to gather, chat, and plan social events.

 Now, the Singles Social Group meets regularly, attracting an average of 20 members per meeting!

 Location is key Sandy, familiar with the Erickson Senior Living lifestyle, was among the first retirees to join the Priority List for The Grandview.

 “I had a friend at Riderwood, [an Erickson Senior Living community in Silver Spring, Md.], who told me about The Grandview,” recalls Sandy, who was glad to hear that another Erickson community was coming to the area she knows and loves. “I live in Bethesda; this is the community I have known for 30 years and am comfortable living in.”

 She notes that joining the Priority List was an easy decision, especially since the $1,000 deposit is completely refundable.

 Since joining, Sandy has been invited to exclusive informational events and received regular progress updates on the community’s construction–before members of the public.

 A home with a view Sandy also had first choice of available residences thanks to her Priority List status. Mishraky helped her find one with a view of trees and green space. “I got to know George while he was still at Riderwood, so we have a longtime relationship now,” she says, with a laugh.

 After exploring some floor plan options together, she decided on the Darcy, a one-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath home with a den and balcony.

 Then, Planning and Moving Consultant Hannah Davis visited her house several times to assist with space planning–another perk exclusive to Priority List members.

 “She brought my floor plan, and I was able to see exactly where my furniture would go and what I could take with me,” she recalls. “It was so nice to have a clear picture of where everything will go.”

 Joining the Priority List early also gave Sandy plenty of time to decide what to bring and what to give away or donate.

 “When I reached out to my family and friends, it was a really warm feeling for me when someone would say, ‘I want this item,'” she says.

 A welcoming environment After tackling those logistic steps, Sandy was ready to start thinking about her new vibrant, social lifestyle.

 She notes that the Singles Social Group has become a great way for people to connect.

 “We have created a safe, welcoming, comfortable, and relaxed environment for us to meet other people before we move in,” says Sandy. “We can bounce ideas off each other and get advice on downsizing, for example.”

 She notes one particular example. “One member had a lot of antiques from her grandmother, so she shared with the group her experience with an auction house that came to her house and helped her sell these items in case someone else needed a similar service.”

 Sandy believes that the group provides peace of mind for their families as well.

 “Many of us want to lessen the burden on our children, so they like to know that we will have a large group of friends here,” says Sandy, a retired school social worker with two children in the area. “My kids are loving and dedicated, but they have their own busy lives. It’s a gift to them for me to move to The Grandview.”   Plenty to keep busy In addition to the Singles Social Group, other clubs have formed on a range of topics–books, computers, fitness, meditation, knitting, painting, and travel–providing additional opportunities to socialize and get involved in the community.

 Sandy is interested in checking out the current events club and the painting club.

 “I also exercise, so I look forward to heading down [to the fitness center] at 6 a.m. and walking two miles on the treadmill,” she says. “There will also be outdoor trails onsite, so I can join a walking group to get some fresh air and have another opportunity for socializing.”

 She adds, “I cherish the friends I have, but I am also looking forward to making new ones. I like how everyone is moving in at the same time, so everyone is eager to make new friends.”
