# Brag House Invests $4 Million in CleanCore Solutions’ Foundation-Backed Dogecoin Treasury Framework

Brag House Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: TBH), the Gen Z engagement platform at the intersection of gaming, college sports, and digital media, today announced a $4 million investment in CleanCore Solutions’ Foundation-backed Dogecoin treasury model through the purchase of pre-funded warrants. The investment provides exposure to Dogecoin alongside leading institutional and digital asset investors, and the Company believes it will strengthen Brag House’s balance sheet and enhance digital fan experiences.

 The allocation was part of the $175 million private placement for CleanCore Solutions, the largest Dogecoin treasury transaction to date. This places Brag House alongside more than 80 top-tier institutional and digital finance investors in a Foundation-backed Dogecoin treasury model.

 The investment is made against the backdrop of a strengthened balance sheet and improved equity position for the Company. Specifically, the Company eliminated all $6.6 million of convertible debt and accrued interest through equity conversions at its IPO completed on March 7, 2025. Stockholders’ equity moved from an $8.5 million deficit last year to a surplus of over $900,000 in the latest quarterly filing. In July 2025, the Company also raised approximately $15 million through a private placement of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, providing additional liquidity to support ongoing growth initiatives.

 “This investment builds directly on our strategy and strengthens it,” said Lavell Juan Malloy II, CEO and Co-Founder of Brag House. “By joining a Foundation-backed Dogecoin treasury model alongside leading institutional investors, we are aligning with an asset that carries both cultural relevance and financial validation.”

 The investment underscores Brag House’s mission to build the ultimate platform for Gen Z interaction by participating directly in the digital ecosystems they value.

 Key Strategic Drivers of the Investment:

 * Deepening Gen Z Alignment: This investment solidifies Brag House’s authenticity and cultural relevance with its core demographic.
* Prudent and Validated Financial Strategy: Made from a debt-free position, the investment diversifies the Company’s treasury with a potentially high-growth asset class and carries the validation of significant institutional co-investment.

 “For our audience, Dogecoin isn’t just a digital asset; it’s a cultural artifact that embodies the fusion of social media, finance, and community,” continued Malloy.

 Potential Upside:

 While Brag House makes no forward-looking guarantees, the investment provides exposure to a foundation-backed digital asset treasury with significant historical volatility and growth potential. Any appreciation in the underlying assets could enhance the value of the investment and further support the Company’s financial position.
