# Symetra Named a Fortune Best Workplace in Financial Services &amp; Insurance™ For Third Consecutive Year

BELLEVUE, Wash.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Symetra Life Insurance Company announced that Fortune magazine and Great Place to Work have recognized the company as one of the 2025 Best Workplaces in Financial Services & Insurance. This is Symetra’s third consecutive appearance on the list, coming in at No. 29 among organizations in the large workplaces category.

 A global authority on workplace culture, Great Place to Work has been surveying employees around the world about their workplace experiences for 30 years. The 2025 Fortune Best Workplaces for Financial Services & Insurance list was selected by analyzing confidential survey responses from more than 1.3 million employees, representing the experiences of 8.4 million employees in the U.S. in 2024 and 2025. Of those responses, more than 194,000 responses were received from employees at Great Place To Work Certified companies in the financial services and insurance industry, and the 2025 rankings are based on that feedback.

 “We are thrilled to be named to the Fortune Best Workplaces in Financial Services & Insurance list for the third year in a row — and proud to be recognized as a workplace where employees can contribute in meaningful ways and grow a career in a culture built on authenticity, connection and opportunity,” said Anne-Marie Diouf, senior vice president and chief human resources officer.

 Ninety-two percent of Symetra’s surveyed employees say it is a great place to work compared to 57 percent of employees at a typical U.S.-based company, while 96 percent said you are made to feel welcome when you join the company and 95 percent feel good about the ways the company contributes to the community.

 Symetra’s recent workplace awards and recognition also include Fortune Best Workplaces for Women (2022, 2023, 2024), Fortune Best Workplaces for Millennials (2024), Fortune Best Workplaces for Parents and Forbes America’s Best Midsize Employers (2023).
