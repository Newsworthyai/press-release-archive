# Q&A with Marlon and Jessica Wentworth, Founders of Energetic Exotics

When Marlon and Jessica Wentworth launched Energetic Exotics, they weren’t just stepping into the luxury car rental market, they were creating a new standard for high-end experiences in Tampa Bay. Starting with a single Mercedes-Maybach, the couple transformed their vision into a thriving concierge brand offering everything from Ferraris to private jets. In this Q&A, the Wentworths share how their backgrounds in logistics and healthcare shaped their approach, the partnerships that fueled their growth, and why giving back to the community is as important as growing the fleet.

 What was the catalyst behind launching Energetic Exotics, and what gap in the market were you hoping to fill?

 Marlon: My wife and I recognized a void in Tampa Bay’s luxury transportation scene. While Miami thrived with high-end car rentals, Tampa lacked such offerings. Investing our life savings, we purchased a Mercedes-Maybach, aiming to introduce a premium experience to our community. Our goal was to provide not just luxury vehicles but an entire lifestyle experience.

 How did your professional backgrounds in logistics and healthcare inform the way you built and scaled the business?

 Marlon: I handled the logistics side, making sure the fleet ran smoothly and everything was on schedule. Jessica brought her sharp eye for detail , which was perfect for managing clients and the day-to-day operations. Together, we built a business that’s organized and completely focused on giving our clients a great experience.

 Can you walk us through how your fleet started and how it’s evolved since your first car?

 Jessica: We began with the Mercedes-Maybach then added a Maserati Ghibli. As demand grew, so did our fleet. Today, we boast an array of luxury vehicles, including Ferraris, Lamborghinis, and Rolls-Royces, catering to diverse client preferences across Florida.

 What differentiates Energetic Exotics from other luxury car rental or concierge services in Florida?

 Marlon: We’re not just handing you the keys, we’re setting the vibe. Need a yacht? Private jet? VIP access to something exclusive? We’ve got you. It’s more than a rental, it’s your luxury lifestyle, handled.

 What were some of the biggest challenges you faced in launching the company, and how did you overcome them?

 Jessica: We didn’t have any industry contacts when we started, which was definitely tough. But we stuck with it, built real relationships, and focused on giving great service. Over time, that’s what helped us earn our spot and build a name people trust.

 How have strategic partnerships with hotels, Airbnb hosts, and yacht services helped accelerate your growth?

 Marlon: Collaborations took things to the next level! Teaming up with luxury hotels and yacht services let us create full-blown VIP experiences…think dream packages, not just rentals. It leveled up the client experience and seriously boosted our presence in the luxury scene.

 What role does community involvement play in your business model and brand identity?

 Jessica: Getting involved in the community is a big part of what we do. From putting on events like Hot Wheel Fest to joining local causes, it’s our way of giving back and it’s helped people get to know and trust our brand along the way.

 As entrepreneurs and co-founders, how do you divide responsibilities and keep your vision aligned?

 Marlon: We stick to what we’re good at. I handle the operations and logistics, and Jessica takes care of the clients and all the behind-the-scenes work.

 Jessica: Our team also helps share the load, which makes a huge difference. We check in regularly to stay on the same page and keep the vision for Energetic Exotics growing strong together.

 How do you define success for Energetic Exotics, and what does that look like day-to-day as founders?

 Jessica: Success includes empowering others to pursue their dreams, fostering a community where luxury experiences are accessible, and continually evolving our brand to offer more than just car rentals. Day-to-day, it means helping clients have amazing experiences, supporting other small business owners, and always finding ways to grow and improve what we offer.

 What advice would you give other founders looking to turn a lifestyle or passion into a scalable business?

 Marlon: Stick to your vision, lean into what you’re good at, and don’t be afraid to actually talk to people, real relationships go a long way. Challenges? Just plot twists in your success story. With enough hustle (and caffeine), you can definitely turn your passion into a legit business.
