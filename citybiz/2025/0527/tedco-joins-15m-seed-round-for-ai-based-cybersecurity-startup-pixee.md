# TEDCO Joins $15M Seed Round for AI-Based Cybersecurity Startup Pixee

Baltimore-based Pixee, which aims to automate the last mile of application security from alerts to resolution, has closed a $15 million seed round led by Decibel and Wing VC, both of Palo Alto, Calif., with participation from the Maryland state technology development agency TEDCO, Brazil’s PrimeSet and strategic investors, including GitHub engineer Zach Holman, HackerOne founder Alex Rice and Brian Chess, Oracle’s senior vice president of Cloud Operations.

 CEO Surag Patel and Chief Technology Officer Arshan Dabirsiaghi founded Pixee with the goal of using agentic AI for context and logic, alongside deterministic techniques, to streamline cybersecurity. The approach is expected to enable patching of vulnerabilities in mere days. Citing IDC, the company said 70% of corrective code fixes for application security issues will be generated by AI-assisted automated remediation tools by 2027.

 Both Patel and Dabirsiaghi worked at Contrast Security, where Dabirsiaghi was also a co-founder. Patel received an MS in Engineering Management from Duke University, a joint program also involving the Fuqua School of Business and Duke’s Law School. He was the chief strategy officer at Contrast Security, and held leadership roles at 41st Parameter (acquired by Experian), comScore and InMobi. Dabirsiaghi received an MS in Computer Science from Towson University, and has previously worked at Aspect Security.

By focusing on capabilities like automated, production-ready code fixes directly into developer workflows and automating expert automated triage for security, enterprises can ship secure code at unprecedented velocity, he added.

 “Maryland is not only home to the top concentration of STEM researchers and workers in the country, but the state is also the epicenter of cybersecurity talent worldwide,” TEDCO CEO Troy LeMaile-Stovall said. “This reality has led us to invest in creating a more sustainable and efficient structure for our workforce pipeline. In return, we are excited to continue enabling cybersecurity businesses’ growth and success.”

 Pixee’s founding duo says on the company’s website that they created Pixee to lift the “security burden off of developers by providing them with a tool that could instantly ‘just fix’ vulnerabilities directly in their codebase.” By hardening code automatically, Pixee enables developers to ship secure code faster without sacrifices to their productivity or workflow, they added.

 Pixee’s product integrates with developer workflows, including GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps, creating pull requests with ready-to-accept code. Early enterprise customers have recaptured 91% of developer remediation time and cut security triage time by 74%, the company said, adding htat  automated code fixes achieve a 76% merge rate.

 Pixee said it would use the new capital to help it accelerate product development and expansion of the go-to-market team.
