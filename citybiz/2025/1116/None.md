# Couple Sings the Praises of Riderwood’s Most Popular Two-Bedroom Floor Plan

By Kelly Shue

 The first time Tony and Catherine D’Elia visited Riderwood, an Erickson Senior Living community in Silver Spring, Md., they were immediately impressed by the large, diverse, welcoming community.

 Despite having submitted a deposit at a smaller retirement community on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, they joined Riderwood’s Priority List and began exploring the 20-plus floor plan designs.

 They selected the popular Hastings, a two-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath floor plan, and moved from their house in Chestertown, Md., to Riderwood in 2023.

 “We planned ahead, looking for a home that would be as perfect for us in ten years as it is right now,” says Tony.

 “The Hastings was the perfect choice for us,” adds Catherine. “It is exactly the right size. We wake up every morning more than satisfied.”

 Planning and deciding Prior to their move, Tony and Catherine took advantage of several Priority List perks, one of which was a home visit with Riderwood’s planning and moving consultant, Jennifer Hill.

 During this informal meeting, Tony and Catherine walked through their house and identified furniture they wished to bring with them. Based on what they pointed out, Hill suggested floor plan options that would work best for the couple.

 Jennifer created a plan for the Hastings and the Jackson, another two-bedroom design they were considering, says Catherine. “On a magnetized model, [she] placed our furniture in each room so we could see how it would all fit.”

 The couple carefully considered the placement of their belongings in the models and were confident that the Hastings would best meet their personal tastes and preferences.

 Home sweet home While they originally planned to move in 2025, Tony and Catherine were eager to embrace the community’s vibrant lifestyle, so they asked to be contacted if a Hastings–or a Jackson–became available as early as spring 2023.

 “When we received the phone call that both homes were available, we came to see them the next day,” recalls Catherine. “One look at the Hastings in Village Square facing the chapel, and my mind was made up. I really think it’s the best in the whole community, at least for us. I immediately noticed the lovely daffodils outside the windows, and Tony really liked the outdoor patio.”

 In addition to offering ample space for the couple’s dining room set, the Hastings boasts a large kitchen–large enough to fit another table and chairs for a dinette. Tony and Catherine, however, decided to leave the space open. Instead, they enjoy their meals at the dining room table, looking out at the patio and chapel.

 The couple frequently orders takeout dinners from one of Riderwood’s eight restaurants, savoring their meals at the dining room table or on the patio.

 Their second bedroom serves as a guest room, yoga studio, TV room, and Tony’s office.

 Making it personal With the help of Riderwood’s Custom Interiors team, Tony and Catherine further personalized their home.

 “One thing we really wanted was shutters on the windows and a sliding door to the patio,” says Catherine. “Even though we were told that shutters on the sliding door would be a challenge, they accomplished the task without a problem.”

 “As is typical with everyone we’ve encountered at Riderwood, they love to say yes to our requests,” notes Tony. “We also chose to remove the carpeting in the two bedrooms and change the paint color throughout. Everyone was very accommodating.”

 World of opportunities When they’re not enjoying their beautiful home, the D’Elias are out and about in the community, taking advantage of the vibrant lifestyle that first caught their attention.

 Shortly after moving in, “We attended a Pride affirmation service and enjoyed the annual Pride parade and entertainment. Everyone is so welcoming,” says Tony.

 Catherine is a member of the genealogy club, walks frequently, and visits the fitness center. Tony attends the Catholics in Conversation’s weekly discussion meetings, swims in the pool, rides his bike, and plays pickleball. Together, they volunteer as Riderwood ambassadors, sharing their experiences with prospective residents.

 “Catherine and I did everything ourselves in our homes over the years, and now we don’t want all the work,” explains Tony. “When it came to choosing Riderwood, we knew what we wanted, but we received more than we ever expected. We are very pleased to have integrated ourselves into such a unique and energizing community.”
