# inDrive Launches Ride-Hailing In Riyadh, Strengthens Footprint In Saudi Arabia

inDrive, the world’s 2nd most-downloaded ride-hailing app, has launched in Riyadh, its second city in Saudi Arabia. The move strengthens inDrive’s presence in one of the world’s fastest-growing regions.

 The Riyadh launch builds on strong interest seen in the Kingdom and continues inDrive’s investment in service quality and safety, including driver verification, ride tracking, and 24/7 customer support.

 With inDrive, riders propose a fare and drivers choose to accept, decline, or counter. This transparent, in-app negotiation helps both sides agree on a fair price. Drivers also benefit from service fees that are 2–3× lower than typical industry rates.

 Strong MENA footprint inDrive holds strong positions across the Middle East and North Africa, with top rankings in Morocco, Egypt and Algeria — reflecting sustained user demand for fair, affordable services across the region.

 

 Built for frontier markets inDrive’s strategy is designed for fast-changing, mobile-first economies where people demand services that are both affordable and fair. The company recently began rolling out a modular SuperApp—anchored by high-frequency daily services like grocery that deepen engagement and create natural cross-sell into mobility, courier, fintech, and more. inDrive’s super app markets will see the mix of services that matters most locally, rather than a one-size-fits-all blueprint.

 “Riyadh is a big milestone for us,” said Arsen Tomsky, Founder and CEO of inDrive. “We’re building a platform that treats people fairly and puts real choice back in their hands. Our negotiation model is simple, transparent, and it works at scale. We will keep growing by staying local, listening to communities, and delivering everyday value.”

 Scale and performance To date, inDrive has completed more than 6.5 billion transactions and surpassed 360 million app downloads worldwide. The business operates with a capital-efficient, low-CAC, high-retention model that has already brought the company to EBITDA profitability, while delivering double-digit growth in the first half of this year.

 About inDrive inDrive is a global mobility and urban services platform. The inDrive app has been downloaded over 360 million times, and has been named the second most downloaded mobility app for the third consecutive year. In addition to ride-hailing, inDrive provides an expanding list of services, including intercity transportation, delivery, and financial services. In 2023, inDrive launched New Ventures, a venture and M&A arm. inDrive operates in 982 cities in 48 countries. Driven by its mission of challenging injustice, the company is committed to having a positive impact on the lives of one billion people by 2030. It pursues this goal both through its core business, which supports local communities via a fair pricing model; and through the work of its impact programs.
