# Coca-Cola Shifts Alcohol Strategy With Sazerac Partnership

Coca-Cola is reshaping its push into alcoholic drinks, tapping Sazerac Co. to produce and distribute several of its ready-to-drink offerings in the U.S.

 The Atlanta-based beverage giant said its Red Tree Beverages unit has struck a deal with Sazerac, the family-owned spirits company known for Fireball and Buffalo Trace bourbon. Under the agreement, Sazerac will assume responsibility for Fresca Mixed, a forthcoming Fresca Hard line, and Minute Maid Spiked. Those products had previously been aligned with Constellation Brands Inc.

 Red Tree Beveragesâ€™ Minute Maid Spiked lineup includes vodka- and wine-based cocktails such as Pink Lemonade, Fruit Punch, Lime Margarita and Strawberry Daiquiri. Coca-Cola continues to work with Molson Coors Beverage Co. under a licensing arrangement for Topo Chico Hard Seltzer.

 The move gives Sazerac a larger presence in the fast-growing ready-to-drink category, which analysts say is poised for continued expansion in 2026. For Coca-Cola, the shift underscores a strategy of aligning with partners that can provide both scale and distribution muscle in alcohol, an area outside its traditional expertise.

 Coca-Cola shares are up 7.6% this year.
