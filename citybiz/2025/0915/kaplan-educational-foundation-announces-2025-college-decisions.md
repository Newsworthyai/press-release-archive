# Kaplan Educational Foundation Announces 2025 College Decisions

The Kaplan Educational Foundation (KEF) celebrates the latest college decisions from its 18th cohort of scholars in its Kaplan Leadership Program (KLP).

 Established in 2006, the Kaplan Leadership Program helps high-potential, low-income, and underserved community college students complete their associate degree, successfully transfer and go on to earn a four-year bachelor’s degree at the nation’s most highly-selective schools. The program focuses on a holistic approach – providing extensive tutoring, academic advisement services, leadership and career training, stipends for living expenses, and other resources and support to help them expand their personal goals, and eventually attain leadership roles in their professions and communities.

 Since KEF’s inception, Kaplan Leadership Scholars have been accepted to the country’s most competitive schools: 92% percent of Kaplan Leadership Scholars earn a bachelor’s degree. In stark contrast, data from the Aspen Institute shows that while 80 percent of community college students dream of transferring to a four-year school, only 16 percent actually earn a bachelor’s degree – even fewer who come from low-income families.

 College decisions for the 2025 Kaplan Leadership Scholars are as follows:

 * Marco Alvarez, Hostos Community College ‘25, Columbia University
* Emily Blanco, Borough of Manhattan Community College ‘25, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
* Shaheim Kellum, Borough of Manhattan Community College ‘25, Columbia University
* William (Liam) Cesar Lotz, Kingsborough Community College ‘25, Yale University
* Melanie Jerez, Queensborough Community College ‘24, Brown University
* Tymika Lawrence, Borough of Manhattan Community College ‘25, Princeton University
* Samir Perez, UCNJ Union College of Union County, NJ ‘25, Stevens Institute of Technology
* Sabreen Qaisar, Queensborough Community College ‘25, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
* Minerva Ramirez Sencion, Hostos Community College ‘25, The City University of New York City College
* Joseph Sahap, Borough of Manhattan Community College ‘25, Columbia University
* Tabia Tarannum, LaGuardia Community College ‘25, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

 This year’s Scholars earned admission to more than 25 top schools nationwide.

 “We’re thrilled to celebrate this year’s KLP scholars as they continue to build on the program’s 20 year legacy of success,” says Nolvia Delgado, Executive Director, KEF.

 “This year’s cohort continues to represent the high-potential talent that exists in U.S. community colleges, including non-traditional age students, recent immigrants, and first-generation college students. We’re committed to continuing to remove barriers and provide greater access to higher education for talented, motivated individuals.”

 Last year, KEF received a three-year grant from the Ichigo Foundation to fund a new Community College Bridge Program to extend its mission to a younger demographic: high school students. The Ichigo grant will help teens from underserved communities prepare earlier for their community college experience, positioning them for successful transfer to, and graduation from, a four-year institution.
