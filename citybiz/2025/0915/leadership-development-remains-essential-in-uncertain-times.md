# Leadership Development Remains Essential In Uncertain Times

During periods of fiscal uncertainty, it can be tempting to view leadership development as optional rather than essential. As Maryland’s public institutions face tighter budgets, there is concern that training, mentorship, and succession planning may be among the first items considered for reduction. I encourage decision-makers to adopt a different perspective.

 Strong, well-prepared leaders are especially important in times of change. While scaling back leadership development may provide short-term budget relief, doing so can create long-term challenges such as staffing shortages, reduced employee engagement, and difficulty in meeting organizational goals.

 Over the course of my career in leadership development, one lesson has remained clear: challenging circumstances increase—not diminish—the need for capable leaders. Leaders at all levels, from senior executives to front-line supervisors, are tasked with guiding their teams, maintaining morale, and delivering results despite evolving demands. Without ongoing support and training, even the most dedicated professionals can feel unprepared for these mounting responsibilities. Public sector leaders today are navigating hiring freezes, budget reductions, and greater accountability. These pressures make it more important to invest in leadership capacity, helping to reduce risks such as burnout, turnover, and disengagement. Supporting leadership development is not an extra—it is a practical investment in organizational resilience.

 At the Dr. Nancy Grasmick Leadership Institute, anchored at Towson University, we have seen how well-designed leadership programs can help agencies adapt and succeed, even under financial constraints. For example, the Maryland Department of General Services (DGS) partnered with us to provide training for mid-level managers, helping them prepare for more senior responsibilities. This approach supported succession planning and improved talent retention. As a result, DGS strengthened team communication and retained experienced staff during a time when other organizations were facing higher turnover.

 Leadership development does not have to be expensive or time-consuming. Organizations can support their leaders in cost-effective and meaningful ways:

 * Prioritize mentorship and peer learning: Encourage experienced leaders to mentor newer talent, creating a culture of support and knowledge sharing.
* Offer targeted, high-impact training: Focus professional development on essential skills such as communication, strategic thinking, and team management.
* Build a culture of feedback: Two-way communication and constructive feedback help leaders and teams adapt more quickly and effectively.
* Leverage internal talent: Identify high-potential employees and prepare them for leadership roles to reduce reliance on external hiring.
* Support well-being and resilience: Providing resources to help leaders manage stress and maintain balance improves effectiveness and reduces burnout.

 At the Grasmick Institute, we remain committed to helping Maryland’s public institutions prepare the next generation of leaders. Strong leadership is the foundation of resilient organizations, and investing in people ultimately strengthens communities.

 As we move forward, organizations can use this moment not to retreat from leadership development, but to view it as an opportunity—one that enables growth, adaptation, and long-term success.
