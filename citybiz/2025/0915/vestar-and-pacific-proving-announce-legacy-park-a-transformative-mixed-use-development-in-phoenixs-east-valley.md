# Vestar and Pacific Proving Announce Legacy Park: A Transformative Mixed-Use Development in Phoenix’s East Valley

Taking a visionary step toward shaping and securing the future of the Phoenix metropolitan area, Vestar, the leading developer and operator behind landmark retail destinations like Tempe Marketplace and Desert Ridge Marketplace, announces Legacy Park, a multi-billion-dollar mixed-use development in partnership with the legacy owner, Pacific Proving, LLC. Legacy Park is a transformative project that will bring a level of quality and scale never before seen in the East Valley.

 Strategically located at the convergence of Mesa, Gilbert, and Queen Creek, within the city of Mesa, Legacy Park will introduce a dynamic urban core featuring lifestyle retail, luxury residences, Class A office, lush parks and recreation, and world-class hospitality, redefining sophisticated and high-quality mixed-use developments in Arizona.

 “Legacy Park is a generational project that will become an urban oasis and the centerpiece of the East Valley,” said David Larcher, President and CEO of Vestar. “From Tempe Marketplace to Desert Ridge Marketplace, we have built destinations that redefine their communities, and Legacy Park will be no different. This development will set a new benchmark for retail, hospitality, and mixed-use living in Arizona.”

 Legacy Park will offer an unparalleled combination of amenities that will elevate the way residents live, work, shop, and dine close to home. At full build-out, Legacy Park will deliver:

 * 300,000 square feet of upscale retail and chef-driven sit-down restaurants, many debuting in the East Valley for the first time. The size and design will be comparable to Scottsdale Quarter, where Vestar is a strategic partner.
* 2,500 contemporary multifamily residences
* A 600-room resort hotel developed by The Athens Group
* 3.4 million square feet of mid-rise office and corporate campus space
* An over 20-acre lush urban park, including a large lake that will serve as a regional gathering space for recreation, events, and community connection.

 The hospitality experience will be curated by The Athens Group, the renowned developer behind timeless properties for Four Seasons, Montage and Marriott, including Ritz-Carlton resorts. “We are excited to be working with The Athens Group on this project. Their expertise ensures that the resort at Legacy Park will bring lodging and event venues on par with top global destinations, offering a new local option for weddings, milestone events, and weekend escapes for visitors and locals alike,” stated Larcher.

 “As someone who has believed in the potential of this area and land for decades, we are thrilled to partner with Vestar to bring this phase of our property Legacy Park to life,” said Andrew Cohn, Principal of Pacific Proving. “Legacy Park is not just another development. It is a thoughtfully designed community that will bring lasting value and lifestyle to the East Valley. We have waited for the right timing, the right opportunity, and the right partners and that moment is now.”

 Located adjacent to Mesa Gateway Airport and easily accessible via the new State Route 24 at Williams Field Road, Legacy Park is expected to become the largest mixed-use development the East Valley has ever seen. Over the next 20 years, the project is projected to generate approximately $56 billion in economic output, create more than 20,000 jobs, and contribute significant tax revenues that will support City of Mesa services, including police, fire, parks, airport and other vital quality-of-life infrastructure.

 Legacy Park is expected to break ground in 2027. Website is coming soon- atlegacypark.com.
