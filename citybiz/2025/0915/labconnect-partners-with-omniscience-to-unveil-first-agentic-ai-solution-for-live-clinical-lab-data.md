# LabConnect Partners with OmniScience to Unveil First Agentic AI Solution for Live Clinical Lab Data

LabConnect, a leading global provider of central laboratory services today announced plans to form a strategic collaboration with OmniScience, the AI company behind Vivo, the first agentic AI control tower for clinical trials. Together, they will deliver the industry’s first AI-driven solution enabling sponsors to gain intelligent, real-time insights from clinical trial lab data.

 Faster Decisions and Smarter Oversight with LabConnect + VivoClinical trial lab data is often siloed, complex, and delayed. This causes slow decision-making and introduces risk. By combining LabConnect’s expertise in central lab testing and data management with OmniScience’s Vivo platform, trial sponsors can now unify fragmented lab datasets, automate oversight, and surface risk signals that accelerate trial timelines and improve outcomes

 About Vivo: Real-Time Intelligence for Clinical Trials, Purpose-Built for Lab DataVivo is an AI-native clinical trial intelligence platform that transforms how teams interact with data across the clinical development lifecycle. Designed to unify disparate sources and deliver real-time insights, Vivo functions as a control tower equipping clinical, operational, safety, and data science teams with the clarity to act faster and more confidently. Vivo-Lab, a specialized implementation of Vivo, brings this same intelligence to laboratory data. Vivo-Lab streamlines lab workflows by surfacing critical trends, anomalies, and site-level discrepancies as they happen, helping teams move from reactive to proactive oversight in one of the most complex and variable data streams in clinical research.

 Transforming Lab Data into Real-Time Action“Our mission at OmniScience is to help trial teams see and act faster,” said Angela Holmes, CEO and Co-Founder of OmniScience. “Partnering with LabConnect extends that vision by transforming lab data into real time actionable intelligence that sponsors can trust.”

 Wes Wheeler, CEO of LabConnect, added: “At LabConnect, we’re committed to helping sponsors unlock the full potential of their lab data. By integrating OmniScience’s transformative AI, we are shifting lab results from static reports into dynamic, actionable intelligence. Together, we’re giving clinical operations teams the speed, agility, and precision they need to make smarter decisions, improve trial efficiency, and bring therapies to patients faster.”

 The partnership underscores both organizations’ commitment to innovation in clinical development, bringing together LabConnect’s technology-driven laboratory operations and OmniScience’s AI-native approach to trial intelligence.
