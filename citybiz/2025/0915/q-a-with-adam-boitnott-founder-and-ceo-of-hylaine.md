# Q&amp;A with Adam Boitnott, Founder and CEO of Hylaine

Adam Boitnott is the founder and CEO of Hylaine, a technology consulting firm he established in 2017 to redefine the consulting model with a values-led approach. With more than 25 years of experience in technology consulting and strategy, Adam brings deep expertise in helping organizations modernize legacy systems, accelerate software development, and lay the data foundation for AI enablement.

 Before founding Hylaine, Adam held leadership roles with CTS, Aeroprobe, NetVentures, and Daxko, and began his career at Accenture. Over the course of his career, he has built a reputation for fostering trusted client partnerships and growing revenue while building high-performing teams with a strong company culture. Under his leadership, Hylaine has risen to be one of the fastest-growing private companies in the U.S, serving Fortune 1000 clients in banking, insurance, healthcare, and life sciences.

 Adam is a proud graduate of Virginia Tech. He and his wife, Dawn (also a Hokie), are the proud parents of two daughters, Hylton and Maclaine. The company’s name, Hylaine, honors his daughters while also reflecting a guiding philosophy: to take the “high lane” by putting client needs above the firm’s own. Adam is an avid sports enthusiast, a supporter of Virginia Tech Women’s Basketball, and enjoys spending time and traveling with his family.

 Can you introduce Hylaine and share what inspired you to start the company?

 Hylaine is a values-first technology consulting firm. We reject the traditional consulting model and stand for partnerships over transactions, doing what’s right over what’s easy, honesty without exception—no bait and switch—ever, and transparency in everything.

 When I started Hylaine, I kept hearing the same stories from clients about consulting firms overpromising, underdelivering, and swapping their “A team” for junior consultants after winning the business. We built Hylaine to be the opposite of that. We don’t believe in bait-and-switch tactics, pushy sales, or pretending to know everything. We believe in earning trust, doing good work, and being a partner our clients can count on.

 What kind of technology problems does Hylaine solve for its clients?

 We help Fortune 1000 companies solve problems like outdated tech systems, slow software development and time to market, and data that’s unreliable, unstructured, or scattered. We modernize systems, accelerate software delivery, and drive data accuracy so companies can use AI effectively. That might mean building new applications, integrating systems, implementing governance frameworks, or ensuring data is resilient and trusted.  What types of tech consulting services does Hylaine offer?

 Our core services include Advisory, Data & AI, Application Development, Cloud, and Delivery. These are led by expert teams who drive outcomes from ideation to implementation.

 What sets Hylaine’s approach apart from other tech consulting firms? Why should business and technology leaders care?

 Hylaine is a different kind of technology consulting firm. Our mission is to value true partnerships over transactions, doing what’s right over what’s easy, and being transparent in everything we do.

 We believe in putting our clients’ needs ahead of our own, providing clients with an experienced team from the start, telling the truth early—even when it’s hard. We’re up front about what we do best, and let clients know when something isn’t in our wheelhouse.

 We’ve walked away from projects where we knew we weren’t the best fit. That’s not lost revenue—it’s protecting the client’s trust. The result? They often come back for the right project later, and the relationship is stronger.

 This approach matters to business and tech leaders seeking a true partner who shares their values and is aligned to their success. As one prospective client told me, “Your values are ridiculously compelling. I’m not looking for a one-night stand. I’m looking for a long-term relationship.”

 Are there specific industries where Hylaine has been especially effective?

 We’re trusted by tech leaders in highly regulated, data-intensive industries—especially in banking, insurance, healthcare, and life sciences—where compliance, performance, and scalability are non-negotiable. We’re earning a reputation for solving complex, high-stakes technology challenges in these sectors.  Can you share an example of a client success story—where Hylaine solved a critical issue and delivered measurable results?

 We helped a Fortune 25 healthcare enterprise avoid $1M+ in risk exposure through data reliability.

 The client had struggled with a lack of visibility into where its data originated, how it was being used, and whether it could be trusted following a series of acquisitions.

 To address these challenges, Hylaine designed and delivered a data reliability framework to improve observability and data quality across critical systems. We implemented audit tools, validation engines, and comprehensive reliability analytics, laying the groundwork for future automation and expanding the Data Reliability coverage across more sensitive and critical data pipelines in the client organization’s data footprint.

 Results were impressive, including:

 * $1M+ in risk exposure avoided
* 80% faster root-cause analysis
* Auto-detection of 80%+ of data anomalies in key pipelines
* Enabled data conversion to transition a $1B+ business to a new platform

 Who are some of the organizations you’ve partnered with?

 Our clients include some of the biggest names in banking, insurance, healthcare, and life sciences, as well as select organizations in other industries across our priority regions. We’ve worked with some of the most well-known organizations in these industries, including a Fortune 5 best large workplace in manufacturing, a top 20 U.S. retail bank, a Fortune 25 healthcare enterprise, and a top 20 U.S. biotechnology firm.

 AI is reshaping industries at a rapid pace. What’s the biggest barrier you see companies face when transitioning from AI from pilot projects to AI delivering real business impact?

 Companies are rushing into AI without being ready for it. AI projects are failing because enterprises aren’t prepared at the foundation. Too often, data lives in silos, governance is inconsistent, and even basic definitions vary from one business unit to another. We’ve seen AI pilots stall for months, not because the model was wrong, but because leaders couldn’t agree on what success should look like.

 At Hylaine, we believe AI readiness isn’t an IT problem—it’s an enterprise test. Being truly ready means having clean, consistent data, clear governance, and integration patterns that can scale. That’s why we invest in data reliability engineering from day one of every engagement. AI can absolutely deliver on its promise, but only if organizations do the hard work of fixing their foundations first.

 Why did you decide to unveil a new brand identity, and what does it represent for Hylaine’s future?

 Growth is driving Hylaine’s big brand move. We’re planning to grow our workforce by 50% over the next year. Since founding Hylaine in 2017 (8 years ago), we’ve grown rapidly and intentionally, expanding our reach to 5 U.S. hubs (Charlotte, NC; Atlanta, GA; Dallas-Fort Worth, TX; Indianapolis, IN; Raleigh, NC) and deepening our expertise. The new brand reflects who we are today—a proven, values-led technology consulting partner—and where we’re headed next. It’s not just a new look; it’s a clearer expression of the principles we’ve stood for since day one.

 What’s your long-term vision for Hylaine?

 Our vision is to set a new gold standard for the technology consulting industry by redefining what values-led leadership looks like. Technology will keep evolving, but our commitment to client partnership, honesty, and transparency is non-negotiable. That’s what makes Hylaine different—and why clients stay loyal to us.

 Hylaine’s long-term vision is centered on sustainable growth while remaining a privately held firm. The company is pursuing expansion through a combination of organic growth and strategic mergers and acquisitions within the U.S. market. As part of this strategy, we plan to deepen our focus in banking, insurance, healthcare, and life sciences. Backed by self-funding and venture capital support from Summit Park, Hylaine plans to scale its operations significantly, with a goal of growing its workforce by 50% over the next year.
