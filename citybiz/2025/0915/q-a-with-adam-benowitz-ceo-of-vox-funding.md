 What makes Vox Funding unique in today’s competitive financing landscape?

 Our tagline really captures it: we’re fast, flexible, creative, and customer-focused. We put the customer first in everything we do. What sets us apart is that we have many different financial products to suit every small business person, no matter who they are or what their needs might be. We’re not a one-size-fits-all operation.

 Tell us about your journey to becoming CEO of Vox Funding. What drew you to the alternative financing space?

 Honestly, I saw an under explored opportunity in a market that wasn’t being well-served. The small business community is often forgotten in today’s traditional banking system, and I recognized there was a chance to do something meaningful – to make money while helping small business people. As an entrepreneur myself, the idea of being an entrepreneur who helps other entrepreneurs was very appealing to me.

 How has Vox Funding’s approach evolved since you’ve been at the helm?

 We’ve retained the same customer focus and commitment to caring about the small business community, but we’ve increasingly utilized technology and data science to expand our reach and capabilities. This allows us to be faster, more responsive, and better able to scale while meeting our customers’ needs more quickly. The core mission remains the same, but our tools have become more sophisticated.

 What are you seeing in the current finance landscape that excites you the most?

 The rise of private credit and the ability to innovate with new financial products is really exciting. There’s tremendous creativity in how people are solving financial challenges today. I’m also thankful that traditional banks continue to step back from addressing these problems – it creates opportunities for companies like ours to step in and provide real solutions.

 How have recent economic conditions and interest rate changes affected your business and your clients?

 It’s already a tough landscape for SMBs, and spikes in interest rates make it that much harder and more difficult for small business owners to meet their needs. Supply chain disruptions that come with economic volatility make things even worse, but we’re trying to help where we can.

 What trends are you observing in how small and midsize businesses approach funding today compared to a few years ago?

 They’re becoming much more comfortable with private lenders and private credit institutions, largely by necessity. Non-bank lending has become more and more the norm, and businesses are increasingly open to these alternatives when traditional banks won’t serve their needs.

 What’s the biggest challenge you face as an entrepreneur in the financial services sector?

 Competition is always our biggest challenge. With greater acceptance of private lending comes more people entering the space. It’s incumbent upon us to always be innovating to stay ahead of everybody else.

 In terms of innovation, what do you focus on most?

 Product innovation comes first – figuring out how to better meet the customer’s needs. Then data analytics, which tells you so much about what’s happening and what people need.

 Technology is important but increasingly commoditized. It’s becoming easier and easier for everybody to access the same tech quickly, so technology alone isn’t as big a differentiator as intelligent decision-making and product innovation. For example, we’re working on an interest-only credit facility for small businesses that we think could be a game changer, similar to how interest-only mortgages help people afford what they need.

 What’s your philosophy when it comes to building and leading a team in the fast-paced fintech space?

 I want people who are creative thinkers and problem solvers, not drones. That’s what I want and what I try to train everyone to be. I don’t need people to simply do what I tell them – I want them to do what needs to be done. I also believe in straight communication: tell people when they’ve messed up and give them praise when they deserve it.

 Do you have any secrets to success as an entrepreneur and CEO?

 I don’t think there are any hidden tricks to success. For me, it’s always come back to simple values – showing up every day with persistence, working harder than most would, and refusing to stop being curious. Creativity and innovation aren’t just buzzwords, they’re what keep you moving forward when the easy answer would be to give up.

 One thing I’ve held onto throughout my career – whether it was on the trading floor or now building companies – is the power of being present. I genuinely believe nothing replaces the energy, accountability, and speed of being in person with your team. Some might see that as old-fashioned, but in my experience, that’s where trust and momentum are built. If there’s any ‘secret,’ it’s that blend: timeless values and the discipline of showing up, paired with a willingness to adapt and push into the future

 How do you see the alternative lending space evolving over the next few years?

 I think it will continue to grow, but I believe that people who are able to address specific needs with specific products will succeed, while generalist approaches will tend to fall away. Industry-specific solutions will prevail – people with tailored solutions for e-commerce, construction, or other specific sectors will do better than those trying to serve everyone the same way.

 What role do you think technology will play in the future of business financing?

 Technology will continue to move forward, but it’s becoming democratized at a rapid pace with AI and other tools. In many ways, more people will have access to the same technology, so innovation, as always, will be what keeps you ahead of the competition.
