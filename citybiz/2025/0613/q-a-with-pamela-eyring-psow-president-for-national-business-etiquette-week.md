 We sat down with Pamela to discuss the timeliness of National Business Etiquette Week and lessons learned for leaders and teams to navigate as many new graduates enter the workforce and undergraduate students begin internships. She also shares best practices for all professionals who are getting re-acquanted with return-to-office and in-person working requirements.

 Why is business etiquette non-negotiable for new professionals?

 Separating yourself from the competition in business can be difficult.

 Product quality can be matched, materials can be sourced, services can be replicated, and new competitors can emerge.

 Often, the difference between closing the deal and losing the opportunity isn’t the product itself. It’s how you conduct yourself with people and connect with existing and potential customers.

 Unfortunately, five years after the pandemic reshaped our working and learning environments, organizations are acutely aware of a noticeable lack of professionalism among new workforce entrants.

 This is bad for businesses now and in the future.

 One Gartner report found that nearly half of Gen Z employees say the pandemic made pursuing educational or career goals more difficult.

 During the pandemic, younger generations primarily went to school remotely. As the Gartner report notes, without in-person connections and interactions at school, Gen Z “missed out on developing soft skills, such as negotiating, networking, speaking confidently in front of crowds, and developing the social stamina and attentiveness required to work long hours, in an in-person environment.”

 Consequently, hiring managers are reluctant to hire Gen Z employees, citing underdeveloped soft skills as one of the most important factors in their decision-making.

 Solving this problem is difficult. Companies are complicated, and managers are busy.

 One study even found that 20 percent of managers are considering quitting because of the stress of overseeing Gen Z employees, with three-quarters saying they require more time and investment than employees of other generations.

 What is the significance of National Business Etiquette Week for this particular workplace topic, among others?

 National Business Etiquette Week, June 9-15, 2025, highlights the critical role that business etiquette plays in a global economy where connections and conduct are the conduits for deal-making.

 Interns, co-ops, summer hires, and recent graduates often bring immense talent and enthusiasm. Yet, their formative educational and initial professional experiences were frequently conducted remotely, sometimes limiting exposure to traditional workplace norms.

 This National Business Etiquette Week, there is an opportunity to reverse this trend, equipping early talent with the competencies needed to succeed individually and effectively represent their organizations’ brands.

 What has caused this shift in professional readiness in young professionals?

 The shift in professional readiness isn’t without cause.

 As I discussed in a recent PBS News Hour interview, the pandemic required companies to adopt entirely remote onboarding processes quickly. While innovative, this shift may have inadvertently de-emphasized aspects of professional presentation and interpersonal dynamics.

 As a result, many young professionals embarking on their careers today have had fewer opportunities for in-person networking, client interactions, or even simple observation of professional conduct in a physical office environment that was once commonplace.

 External influences also play a part.

 Mass media and social media, while powerful tools for connection, don’t always model professional decorum and can expose individuals to communication styles that are far more informal or even confrontational than what is appropriate in the workplace.

 This can contribute to a lack of an internal “filter” or an underdeveloped understanding of appropriate workplace communication and demeanor.

 Often, the diagnosis is simple: they don’t know what they don’t know.

 Many new hires are bright and eager to contribute, but may be unaware of specific unspoken rules or expectations governing professional settings.

 We’ve heard directly from HR leaders and clients about their immediate need to support their young workforce in navigating these nuances, underscoring a desire to see their new talent succeed.

 What tips do you recommend for organizations and young professionals who wish to take action to improve?

 Cultivating a professional environment and equipping new talent with the necessary skills is a shared responsibility.

 Organizations can achieve this in several ways.

 * Integrate Etiquette into Onboarding

 Don’t assume prior knowledge. Your onboarding process for interns, co-ops, and new hires should explicitly cover essential topics such as professional attire expectations, effective communication across different platforms (email, virtual meetings, in-person), dining etiquette for business meals, networking strategies, and the importance of body language and nonverbal cues.

 * Provide Clear Guidelines

 Establish and communicate clear expectations for professionalism. This could be part of an employee handbook or a dedicated guide, addressing conduct in the office and hybrid or remote work scenarios.

 * Champion Mentorship & Role Modeling

 Encourage senior staff and experienced team members to act as mentors and consciously model the professional behaviors you wish to cultivate within the organization.

 * Invest in Formal Training

 Consider partnering with etiquette experts to deliver targeted workshops and provide resources tailored to the specific needs of your early career talent and your industry.

 * Focus on the Details

 Illustrate the impact of seemingly small professional courtesies. For instance, one of our colleagues often mentions her pet peeve when hearing “No problem” instead of a more polished “You’re welcome” after a client says “Thank you.” These subtle shifts in language can significantly elevate professional interactions.

 For interns, summer hires, and new graduates, the following strategies can help develop and activate your soft skills and professionalism standards to maximize your opportunities.

 * Be an Active Observer

 Pay attention to how successful and respected colleagues conduct themselves in meetings, with clients, and in daily interactions.

 * Don’t Hesitate to Ask

 If you’re unsure about a particular protocol or expectation, it’s always better to ask a mentor, supervisor, or trusted colleague for guidance.

 * Embrace Professionalism as a Tool

 Understand that how you dress, speak, and interact is not just about rules; it’s about building your professional image and creating opportunities for career growth.

 * Develop Your Networking Skills

 Learn to introduce yourself confidently, engage in meaningful professional conversations, and follow up appropriately after making new connections. Make it fun by role-playing with your colleagues.

 * Remember Digital Etiquette

 Professionalism extends to all your communications. Be mindful of your tone in emails, your presence in virtual meetings, and even your broader online footprint.

 For many experienced professionals, much of what you share here may sound like common sense, or like it should be naturally ‘known’ for those entering the workforce to be expected to have in place on day one. Why is this not the case?

 That’s a common assumption, but soft skills are not simple or easy. They are often the most difficult skills to master and apply.

 They are, in fact, “power skills,” essential competencies that drive effective communication, foster collaboration, build strong client relationships, and ultimately impact the bottom line.

 National Business Etiquette Week is an annual reminder to focus on these foundational skills.

 It’s a direct investment in individuals and the organizations they join.

 As companies welcome enthusiastic summer hires, interns, and new graduates, now is the ideal moment to build (or reinforce) a strong foundation of professionalism that will serve this emerging talent throughout their careers.
