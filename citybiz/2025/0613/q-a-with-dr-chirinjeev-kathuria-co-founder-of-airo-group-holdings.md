# Q&amp;A with Dr. Chirinjeev Kathuria, Co-Founder of AIRO Group Holdings

Dr. Chirinjeev Kathuria is Co-founder and Chairman of AIRO Group Holdings, a company specializing in advanced aerospace and defense technologies, which recently became publicly listed on the Nasdaq, trading under ticker symbol AIRO, on June 13, 2025. In addition, Dr. Kathuria is a seasoned entrepreneur, investor and physician. He has also co-founded several publicly traded companies and has a BS & MD from Brown University and an MBA from Stanford University.

 What is AIRO Group Holdings and what do you do?

 In short, we’re a leader in advanced aerospace and defense technologies, functioning in four key integrated areas: Drones, Avionics, Training, and Electric Air Mobility. Each segment represents a critical growth vector in the aerospace and defense market which has seen increased demand in recent months for solutions that bolster defense applications, especially with the significant global demand for drone equipment, services and the training needed to pilot them. That’s where AIRO’s innovative technologies and advanced systems come into play. We’re a comprehensive solution for both military and commercial services.

 Our Drones segment, including our RQ-35 Heidrun, leads the development of cutting-edge drone technologies that serve both commercial and military applications worldwide. It’s been one of the best performing drones that operate in a GPS-denied environment, and, to-date, we don’t believe any of these drones, which are used in reconnaissance and targeting, have been shot down.

 Our other divisions include Avionics and Electronics, which develops tools that enhance decision-making and operational efficiency for pilots across general aviation, business jets and military aircraft. The Aspen Avionics brand designs, certifies and manufactures critical navigation, communication and display systems to deliver unmatched precision and reliability, all while meeting the highest government and industry standards. In addition, our Electric Air Mobility division, operating as Jaunt Air Mobility, is pioneering the future of urban air transportation with our patented electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. These systems are rigorously tested and designed for diverse applications such as urban air taxis, cargo transport and emergency response. We also have Coastal Defense, which is our combat training brand and staffed by experienced Special Operations veterans for professional training services in both military and commercial aviation sectors.

 Why was now the right time to go public?

 Considering the significant commercial traction that AIRO has achieved recently, we believe that this present moment is an ideal time for AIRO to enter the public markets to help us unlock the capital to enter our next phase of growth.

 Our business segments have unlocked considerable growth, delivering more than 100% of revenue growth from the previous year, and given this track record and the opportunities ahead for our business, we were ready to move now. Investors have heavy interest in the aerospace and defense sector more broadly, and we believe AIRO is strategically positioned to capitalize on these trends, especially with market uncertainty quieting down.

 How has increased military and defense spending affected the business?

 While we have a disdain for conflict, recent events have shown the increased need for advanced defense applications that ensure national security, safety and protection for military partners and allies alike. NATO countries currently commit at least 2% of their GDP to defense spending, and 20% of defense spending is devoted to new equipment. Even just this past week, President Trump signed executive orders to accelerate domestic drone production, secure American airspace and help position the country to lead the world once again in supersonic technology.

 Moving forward, NATO has signaled that it will increase the 2% benchmark, so we believe the demand for our cutting-edge solutions will only continue to grow. For example, AIRO’s drone division is experiencing unprecedented revenue growth over the past two years, led by branded AIRO’s RQ-35 Heidrun, which has been successfully deployed in the Ukraine conflict.

 We envision ourselves as a broadline solution to these needs in each of the categories that we operate, so while these conflicts are something we wish were not the reality, our job is to make sure that we’re providing access to technologies and training that keep up with global threats. Currently, we have seen an uptick in demand for countries seeking solutions to bolster their defense applications.

 What are your plans for the business following the IPO?

 We expect to use the funds raised to scale operations and fund acquisitions in drones, military training and AI, in addition to other uses. Our strength lies in our diversified yet complementary portfolio of products and services, all centered around a unified aerospace and defense ecosystem. We’re excited to continue innovating and developing our solutions for both military and commercial use. We believe our offerings are essential for both current and future operational landscapes, and we think taking the company public distinguishes us from recent transactions in this sector.

 Importantly, we’re committed to delivering the best solutions for our customers and partners. This dedication is backed further by our commitment to evolving into a publicly traded mid-market global company that is agile, diversified and dedicated to our clients, shareholders and employees. We look forward to continuing to scale, grow and lead this industry with the exceptional leadership team we have in place including myself and CEO Captain Joe Burns, the former director of operations at United Airlines who also helped run its merger with Continental Airlines.
