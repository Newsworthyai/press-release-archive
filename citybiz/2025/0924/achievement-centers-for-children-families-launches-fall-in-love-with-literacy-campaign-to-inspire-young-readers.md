# Achievement Centers for Children &amp; Families Launches “Fall in Love with Literacy” Campaign to Inspire Young Readers

The Achievement Centers for Children & Families has launched its “Fall in Love with Literacy” campaign, a heartwarming initiative designed to foster a love of reading among the community’s youngest learners while building meaningful connections with local leaders.

 This fall-themed campaign invites dignitaries, educators, and community champions to spend 30 minutes reading to our children in the Center’s early learning classrooms. Guests are encouraged to bring a favorite book or choose from a curated selection of age-appropriate titles available on-site. After the story time session with toddlers and preschoolers, guests are invited to take an optional tour of the nationally accredited facility.

 “This is about more than reading—it’s about connection, community, and planting the seeds of literacy,” said Stephanie Seibel, CEO of the Achievement Centers.

 The campaign also serves as a platform to highlight the Achievement Centers’ work and lay the groundwork for future partnerships and funding opportunities. Palm Beach County School Board Member Erica Whitfield is among the first to join the effort, with additional visits being scheduled throughout the fall.

 To learn more or schedule a visit, contact Brandy Miller at (561) 870-3942 or bmiller@delraychild.org.
