# TBC Uzbekistan Extends Financial Services To Non-Residents, Expanding Digital Ecosystem’s Customer Base

TBC Bank Uzbekistan (TBC UZ), the country’s leading digital bank and part of the wider TBC Uzbekistan digital banking ecosystem, announces that it has expanded access to its services to non-residents in Uzbekistan.

 Foreign nationals living in or visiting Uzbekistan will now be able to access TBC UZ’s best-in-class range of digital banking products. These include its flagship Salom Debit Card, as well as deposits, transfers, utility payments and more. These services are provided via the TBC UZ app, offering non-residents the same seamless and intuitive digital experience as current customers.

 This move comes as TBC Uzbekistan, Central Asia’s leading digital banking ecosystem, continues to scale its presence in the country by broadening its product offering and tapping new customer segments. By expanding its services to non-residents in Uzbekistan, the digital banking powerhouse, which already reaches 21 million unique registered users – more than 50% of Uzbekistan’s population – is significantly widening its potential customer base.

 Through this expansion, TBC Uzbekistan is creating new opportunities for the financial integration of highly-skilled expatriate workers, students and entrepreneurs, while fueling the continued growth of the new digital economy. This enables the digital banking ecosystem to tap into a sustainable new customer segment, boosting customer loyalty and engagement and generating diversified revenue streams.

 Nika Kurdiani, CEO of TBC Uzbekistan, commented: “This isn’t just another product launch. We’re opening a new gateway to Uzbekistan’s financial system for people who come here to study, work, or build a business. We’ve already set new standards for retail and business banking, and now we’re taking the next step: integrating non-residents into our digital ecosystem while delivering the same convenience, speed, and security that our existing customers enjoy.”

 New customers can register remotely via the TBC UZ app, completing the online application and verifying their identity via their international passport, proof of temporary registration in Uzbekistan, their personal identification number and their local phone number. A TBC representative will then meet with the new customer to sign the agreement and complete the onboarding process. Currently, TBC representatives can only meet with customers in Tashkent, with this set to be expanded nationwide before the end of the year.

 TBC Uzbekistan is the leading digital banking ecosystem in Central Asia. In addition to digital bank TBC UZ, the ecosystem also comprises Payme, a digital payments app for individuals and small businesses, TBC Nasiya (TBC Instalments), a fast-growing instalment credit business, and TBC Insurance, its fully-digital insurance offering. Payme services are also available to non-residents.
