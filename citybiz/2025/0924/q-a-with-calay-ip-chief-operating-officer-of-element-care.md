# Q&amp;A with Calay Ip, Chief Operating Officer of Element Care

Calay Ip, Chief Operating Officer of Element Care, brings over 20 years of healthcare leadership to her role at this leading provider of senior care services. She has extensive expertise in developing and managing innovative programs, including PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly), Senior Care Options (SCO), and Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs).

 For the last 30 years, Element Care has led the charge in meeting people where they are and coordinating every aspect of care from transportation, to scheduling appointments, and even at-home visits.

 Calay has driven success in value-based care models, financial operations, and program expansion. Before joining Element Care, she served as Vice President of Senior Care Programs at Neighborhood Health, Director of Senior Products Strategy and Business Performance at Tufts Health Plan, and Director of Medicaid ACO Strategy and Operations at Mass General Brigham’s Health Plan. Calay holds an MBA from Boston University and a BS in Finance from Bentley University.

 As the new COO of Element Care PACE, what are your top priorities in your first year?

 As the Chief Operations Offer at Element Care PACE my top priorities are ensuring operational excellence, strengthening our financial performance, and expanding access to our interdisciplinary, coordinate care. My focus will be optimizing and enhancing our high-quality care models that will support our care givers so they can continue to provide exceptional, person-centered care to our participants. I’m also looking forward to leading Element Care through its next phase of growth that will push forward the company’s vision of compassionate, affordable care for seniors.

 What drew you to Element Care and to the PACE model specifically?

 Over the last two decades, my career has been dedicated to leadership across healthcare segments including PACE, SCO, and Medicaid, and I’ve seen firsthand the transformative impact that PACE offers older adults and their families. What drew me to Element Care’s PACE model is the organization’s legacy of delivering compassionate, comprehensive care to older adults in Massachusetts enabling participants to receive the care they need in the comfort of their own homes and communities for as long as possible. For the last 30 years, Element Care has led the charge in meeting people where they are and coordinating every aspect of care from transportation, to scheduling appointments, and even at-home visits.

 What makes PACE unique compared to other senior care models?

 PACE is unique because it is a holistic approach to healthcare for older adults. It streamlines senior care by bringing all medical care under one roof, with an emphasized focus on preventive medicine, and a commitment to personalized attention. Unlike fragmented systems where patients and families must navigate the burden of coordinating payments, appointments, transportation, and more, Element Care PACE brings it all together and in turn reduces hospitalizations, lowers costs, and improves quality of life. We also partner with organizations like 2Life to offer affordable housing for our participants to maintain their independence while having on-site access to medical care.

 What are some of the operational and strategic lessons you’ve learned from leading large-scale turnarounds and expansions that you hope to apply here?

 Leading large-scale initiatives has taught me that success hinges on data-driven decisions, operational efficiency, and team empowerment. I’ve seen firsthand how using analytics to understand performance can unlock new opportunities. Likewise, streamlining processes allows us to reinvest resources where they matter most—in our participants. But most importantly, I’ve learned that you can’t achieve anything without a dedicated and supported team. My goal is to apply these lessons by working alongside the talented Element Care team to enhance our operational model and prepare for strategic growth while ensuring our culture remains our greatest asset.

 What innovations—whether in care delivery, technology, or program design—do you see as most promising for improving outcomes for older adults?

 I’m incredibly optimistic about the power of technology-enabled care. Innovations like remote patient monitoring, telehealth, and AI-powered data analytics are transforming how we deliver care. These tools allow us to monitor participants’ health in real-time, intervene proactively before a crisis occurs, and personalize care plans on a much deeper level. I also believe in integrated models that bridge the gap between healthcare and social services, like our partnership with 2Life. This holistic approach, which considers not just medical needs but also housing and social connection, is where we’ll see the most significant improvements in outcomes and quality of life for older adults.

 How do you think PACE will evolve over the next 5-10 years?

 PACE will continue to expand nationally, particularly in underserved areas as the U.S. population continues to age. With value-based care continuing to gain traction, PACE will be positioned as a flagship model that aligns incentives across Medicare and Medicaid. Element Care PACE’s partnerships with organizations like 2Life will also likely expand over the next 5-10 years, offering integrated housing that enables participants to maintain their independence, while having on-site access to medical care.

 It’s projected that a quarter of the U.S. population will be 65 or older by 2060. This rapid growth underscores the importance of programs like PACE that may become more widely recognized as a cost-saving solution that improves quality of life for the aging population.

 What advice would you give to emerging healthcare leaders who want to make a difference in senior care?

 My advice is to be a lifelong learner and to always prioritize the human element. The senior care landscape is constantly evolving, but the core of our work remains personal. The most effective leaders are those who seek out opportunities to learn from every level of the organization—from frontline staff to the participants themselves. The key to making a real difference is to build strong relationships, advocate for innovative solutions, and be willing to challenge the status quo. The work is challenging, but knowing you’re contributing to a program that allows an older adult to live with dignity and independence is incredibly rewarding.
