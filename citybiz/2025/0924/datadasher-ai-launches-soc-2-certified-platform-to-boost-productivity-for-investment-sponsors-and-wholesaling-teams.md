# DataDasher AI Launches SOC 2-Certified Platform to Boost Productivity for Investment Sponsors and Wholesaling Teams

DataDasher AI, developer of an agentic artificial intelligence platform purpose-built for financial professionals, announced today the launch of an SOC 2-certified system built specifically for investment sponsors and their wholesaling teams.

 Utilizing proprietary Brain LanguageTM AI technology, the SOC 2-certified platform helps wholesalers save 10 to 15 hours each week by streamlining meeting prep, client interactions and follow-ups with tools for real-time data queries, automated email drafting, meeting transcription and note-taking, task detection, email integration and team collaboration.

 “We understand that wholesalers often face unique productivity and connectivity hurdles because they spend so much time traveling, meeting advisors and juggling client relationships,” said Alexander Kearns, CEO of DataDasher. “This tailored version of the powerful DataDasher platform addresses the unique compliance-driven needs of investment sponsors and wholesaling teams while leveraging AI for better advisor coverage efficiency and territory management.”

 DataDasher AI offers a unified client context, ensuring every professional touchpoint is captured, organized and actionable. The system seamlessly integrates with widely used CRM and meeting platforms such as Salesforce, Redtail, Wealthbox, XLR8, Google, Zoom and Microsoft, providing a connected, frictionless experience.

 “DataDasher isn’t just for use in one setting; wholesaling teams can use it during in-person meetings, calls and web conference meetings,” added Kearns. “The platform utilizes strong encryption, secure cloud infrastructure and multi-factor authentication so that customers can have confidence that their data is being handled securely and according to industry best practices.”

 As an SOC 2-certified system, DataDasher is not used to train external AI models and operates in private silos for each investment sponsor firm. DataDasher also enables customizable data retention policies and allows users to decide which meetings are transcribed.

 Firms can book a tailored demo or request a sandbox trial environment to experience how DataDasher AI enhances wholesaler productivity in real-world workflows by visiting www.datadasher.ai/demo.

 Interested teams can also directly contact Nick Brakovich, DataDasher’s chief revenue officer, at nbrakovich@datadasher.ai for more info.
