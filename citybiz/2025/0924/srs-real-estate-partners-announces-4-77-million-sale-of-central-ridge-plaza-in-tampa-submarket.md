# SRS Real Estate Partners Announces $4.77 Million Sale of Central Ridge Plaza in Tampa Submarket

SRS Real Estate Partners has completed the $4.77 million sale of Central Ridge Plaza, a fully occupied four-tenant retail center located at 1184 North Lecanto Highway in Lecanto, FL, a submarket of Tampa. The 10,800-square-foot, two-building property is occupied by Sketchers, Firehouse Subs, Marco’s Pizza, and Hair Cuttery.

 SRS Capital Markets Associate Connor Barton, Senior Managing Principal Patrick Nutt, and Executive Vice President & Principal William Wamble represented the seller, a Florida-based private developer. The buyer was an Orlando-based group of private investors. The closing cap rate was 6.27%.

 “This property was built in 2024 and all the tenants have new leases in place with scheduled rental increases,” said Barton. “The new ownership will enjoy limited landlord responsibilities and a low-management investment in a state with no income tax. We have seen investors that need financing target these investments as they provide a greater yield and income diversification.”

 The property is part of a larger retail development that features a Walmart Supercenter, Hobby Lobby, and Panda Express, among others. It is also across from Shoppes at Black Diamond, a new 29-acre retail development anchored by Target.

 This year, SRS Capital Markets has completed more than $1.7 billion in deal volume comprised of more than 500 transactions across the nation. SRS currently has in excess of 845 properties actively on the market with a market value surpassing $3.7 billion.
