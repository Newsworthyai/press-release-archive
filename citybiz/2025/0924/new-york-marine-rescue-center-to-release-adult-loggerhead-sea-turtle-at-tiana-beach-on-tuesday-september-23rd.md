# New York Marine Rescue Center to Release Adult Loggerhead Sea Turtle at Tiana Beach on Tuesday, September 23rd

The New York Marine Rescue Center is proud to announce the successful rehabilitation and release of “Pegasus”, an adult loggerhead who was transferred to NYMRC in May from National Aquarium in Baltimore.

 “Pegasus” was originally reported stranded on June 4, 2024, at Assateague National Park in Maryland and was brought to National Aquarium in Baltimore for treatment. Upon assessment, she was found to have been experiencing buoyancy issues due to a suspected vessel strike.

 During her rehabilitation in Baltimore, specialized weights were used to help her overcome floating challenges and regain muscle strength. As her recovery progressed, Pegasus required a larger tank to better monitor her buoyancy and swimming abilities — and that’s where NYMRC stepped in.

 In May of 2025, “Pegasus” was transferred from National Aquarium in Baltimore, MD, to NYMRC in Riverhead, NY. In her time with NYMRC, she has continued her recovery. Thanks to the dedicated teams at both National Aquarium and NYMRC, she is now ready to return to the ocean.

 Before her release, NYMRC Executive Director Maxine Montello will equip Pegasus with a satellite tag to track her post-release movements and provide valuable data on her behavior and movement behavior.

 We are so happy to help our colleagues in Baltimore with this unique case and to play a role in giving Pegasus a second chance,” said Maxine Montello. “Tracking Pegasus will help us learn more about the long-term outcomes of rehabilitated sea turtles and the challenges they face after returning to the wild.”
