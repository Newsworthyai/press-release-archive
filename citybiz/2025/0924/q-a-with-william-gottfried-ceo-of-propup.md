# Q&amp;A with William Gottfried, CEO of PropUp

William Gottfried is the CEO and Co-Founder of PropUp, a fast-growing vacancy management platform transforming how property operators manage unit turns. Based in Austin, he brings a deep background in startups, investing, and operational leadership, with a focus on building high-performing teams and scaling tech-driven solutions in the real estate space. A graduate of the University of Texas School of Law, William combines legal insight with entrepreneurial vision to drive innovation and efficiency in property tech.

 For readers who may not be familiar, can you tell us a little about PropUp?

 Founded by operators with more than a decade of hands-on multifamily experience, PropUp is rethinking property maintenance from the ground up. We focus on giving property management companies and owner-operators innovative tools, like digital boards, mobile inspections, work orders, digital maintenance calendars, and real-time asset tracking, which centralize operations and provide actionable insights.

 PropUp helps site teams get organized, save time, drive resident satisfaction, and generally better execute day-to-day tasks, while delivering best-in-class reporting, data, and visibility up the vertical to senior management and ownership.

 What makes the partnership between PropUp and Fortress OS significant for the property management industry?

 This isn’t just a transactional partnership. Our companies are aligned on building a smarter, more open property management ecosystem. By connecting PropUp’s maintenance and facilities solutions with Fortress OS’s operating platform, we’re giving clients seamless integration that works right, every time.

 Delivering a reliable, strong integration is far from a given in prop tech and both companies know this firsthand, having been on the side of the table for many years. To drive adoption, you need the best features and the best integration. That’s what this partnership delivers.

 How does this integration improve day-to-day maintenance operations?

 Property teams can finally ditch their myriad, disparate analog systems and bring everything under one, shared roof. This includes digitizing their old make-ready boards and integrating formerly standalone trackers, as well as mobile inspections and work orders, and real-time asset and component tracking, all in one connected workflow.

 Instead of juggling spreadsheets, phone calls, emails, texts and other siloed systems, managers can oversee every aspect of maintenance from a single platform. That centralization means nothing falls through the cracks: issues are flagged faster, assignments are tracked in real time, and progress is visible to both staff and leadership. Everyone gets fast answers. Check-in calls are reduced or eliminated. An accountability loop starts sustaining itself simply through use of the software.

 How will residents and staff experience the benefits of this integration?

 PropUp drives resident satisfaction through low friction interactions. For example, residents can complete their move-in inspections on a responsive web version of the PropUp app, with no download required. They can take HD photos and video directly in the inspection and communicate immediately with property staff about any issues in the unit. Issues they flag in their inspection are instantly generated as work orders in Fortress, through our integration. This drives initial satisfaction during the critical first 60 days of a lease, where a large number of renewal decisions are already made.

 The site teams gain critical visibility and organization on all maintenance and facilities operations. PropUp’s data is available in ways both big and small. Large data sets of inspection information can be reviewed as easily as an individual inspection report. PropUp clients can drive performance and track response times on unit turns, inspections, and work orders in easily sortable, interactive reporting views capable of drilling down to the finest details.

 Communication is streamlined for fast answers on what’s happening in any unit at any given time, regardless of the size of the portfolio.

 Because of the strength and breadth of the PropUp – Fortress integration, staff members benefit from AI and automation, with minimal data entry, fewer manual tasks, systems that talk to each other to automate tasks and delight property teams.

 It is about making everyone’s experience, whether living in or running a property, better and more efficient.

 Looking ahead, what does this collaboration mean for the future of property technology?

 It’s a proof point that collaboration, not closed-off systems, is the way forward. By combining Fortress OS’s purpose-built affordable housing platform with PropUp’s best-in-class maintenance capabilities, we’re showing the industry what’s possible: connected systems, quality data, and the flexibility operators deserve to run smarter, more resilient businesses.
