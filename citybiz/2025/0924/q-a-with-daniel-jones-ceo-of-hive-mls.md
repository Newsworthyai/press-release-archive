# Q&amp;A with Daniel Jones, CEO of Hive MLS

Daniel Jones has led the growth at Hive MLS from a regional MLS with just over 6,000 subscribers into a multi-state network of more than 19,000 real estate professionals and 18 shareholder MLSs across North Carolina and Georgia.

 Known as a quiet thought leader, Jones combines a builder’s mind with a teacher’s heart, championing open data access, broker-centric tools, and training programs that meet professionals where they are. He is also a driving force behind the MLS Data Exchange (MDX), a breakthrough model for interoperability at the database level that is reshaping how MLSs collaborate.

 Between 2019 and 2025, Hive MLS tripled from around 6,000 subscribers to over 19,000. Its growth wasn’t driven by mergers or consolidation – it was powered by trust. Associations join Hive because our model delivers a cooperative network built on these 3 C’s: Community, Collaboration, and Connectivity.

 Under his leadership, Hive MLS has earned multiple “Best MLS” honors, but Jones measures success by impact rather than accolades. He values stories of brokers who feel supported, boards that feel empowered, and teams that continue to thrive as a community.

 For those unfamiliar with Hive MLS, what sets your organization apart from others in the MLS landscape today?

 Hive started as a regional MLS, but we’ve never been content with “business as usual.” It took a community to bring us to life as an MLS. It took brokers talking with brokers, Associations meeting with MLS Boards and other Associations creating an idea, a vision, a dream – with established parameters. At Hive, we ensure that Associations are fully empowered to be Associations while the MLS is established to accomplish the vision of brokerages. This dream has never stopped: it’s a perpetual motion machine. It’s a Hive. Our evolution has been about moving from being a service provider to being a true technology partner.

 You’ve been a driving force behind the development of a new MLS Data Exchange or MDX. Can you explain what it is and why it’s such a breakthrough?

 MDX is a completely new way to think about MLS data sharing. Instead of patching together feeds or building one-off integrations, MDX creates interoperability at the database level, creating data sovereignty and autonomy. The platform (FlexMLS, Matrix, Paragon, DynaConnect, etc) becomes free to be a beautiful interface overlay on top of the data that’s truly the MLS. The MDX interface becomes more of an open market to brokerages, rather than constraining the MLS. Multiple MLS instances can connect in real time, without all the friction and duplication that comes with traditional data shares. The breakthrough is that we are building an infrastructure where MLSs keep their independence, but their data can move intelligently across systems.

 How would the MDX model improve the experience for agents, brokers, and MLSs that have long struggled with fragmented systems?

 With MDX, the brokerage either owns the data, or licenses the data from another MLS, or the MLS is given ownership to the data and the MLS licenses it back to the brokerage. With Hive MDX, it’s their choice. Our guiding philosophy is that the brokerage should have sovereign control over the data under the constraints of the agreements they have to participate with other brokerages.

 For example, what if a large brokerage simply wants to have one platform or interface nationwide? What if they want to create their own platform? An MDX allows them to do this, and fully cooperate with other brokerages. Or what if a small brokerage is split between two MLSs and they don’t want the headache of learning two interfaces to enter data, to search data, or deliver the data to CMAs? The MDX allows this to happen at a brokerage level. MDX makes that possible by replacing siloed systems with a unified infrastructure. For brokers, it means cleaner operations and less redundancy. For MLSs, it means less time spent maintaining patches and more time focused on serving their subscribers. Add/Edit from any front end would be a reality with MDX, and that’s a game-changer. You’ve partnered with SourceRE to power this technology. What makes this relationship unique and strategically valuable?

 We knew from the start that building MDX would require both vision and technical horsepower. SourceRE brings the engineering depth, while Hive brings the MLS know-how, business model and a culture of collaboration. That partnership allows us to move fast without taking on the overhead of trying to reinvent everything in-house. Together, we’re able to deliver innovation at a pace this industry isn’t used to seeing.

 You’ve said MDX can enable “intelligent consolidation.” What does that mean and how is it different from traditional MLS mergers?

 At Hive MLS, we don’t do mergers. We invite Associations and MLSs to join us: “come just as you are,” let’s work together to standardize your data and your rules. Together, let’s bring more value to your brokerages. This works very well for us – a lot. We are constantly growing.

 We separate Association from MLS, thereby empowering Associations to remain Associations. The next step is to separate the interface from being part of the MLS conversation as well. Intelligent consolidation is a conversation around standardizing the data, rules, and integrity operations. The goal is to maximize a brokerage’s ability to cooperate with their peers with timely, fair data. No two brokerages are alike; so, giving them the ability to use their own tools to overlay our data should be a service an MLS provides.

 Traditional MLS consolidation usually means combining boards, governance, and sometimes entire organizations, and that can take years. With Hive, you keep your Board, keep your governance and you keep your organization. With MDX, we’re talking about consolidating infrastructure, not governance. It’s “intelligent” because it gives MLSs the best of both worlds: autonomy where it matters, and collaboration where it counts. Instead of forcing mergers, MDX makes it possible to share data seamlessly without losing local control.

 Many MLSs have experimented with “Front-End of Choice” (FEoC) solutions. Why do you believe MDX is the better path forward?

 The front-end of choice was a good first step, but it doesn’t solve the root problem. The front-end is overlaid with another front-end interface that’s dictated by a particular platform. A platform has to be chosen as a hub. The tie between a database and the platform vendor is very locked-in. So, I believe “front-end of choice” is a misnomer. It also continues to rely on fragmented databases underneath. MDX flips that on its head. It creates true interoperability at the core. That’s why I say MDX is the only real path forward. It’s not about layering options on top of the same old systems: it’s about rethinking the foundation so agents, brokers, and MLSs all benefit.

 What should MLS leaders be asking themselves right now if they want to remain competitive in a fast-evolving data landscape?

 I’d ask these questions: “Are you in sovereign control of your data? How about your brokerages? How easy is it for your brokerage to come to your MLS with their own platform and have instructions on simply adding/editing listings into the MLS?” We know the world is going in this direction. Brokerages will be building their own platforms, creating their own mini-MLSs and forging new participant relationships with each other. If you look closely, you’ll see the seeds being planted today. My advice: get ahead of it. Too many MLSs are stuck maintaining outdated connections, which limits their ability to innovate. The real question is whether you want to keep playing catch-up or get ahead of the curve.

 Leaders should be thinking about independence, interoperability, and how their MLS can create long-term value for subscribers – not just survival in the short term. We are going to be left behind and a new kind of MLS will evolve. Let that be the new MLS.
