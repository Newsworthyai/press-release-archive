 AtlasClear Holdings, today announced the successful closing of the remaining $2,000,000 of the previously announced $5 million company financing.

 AtlasClear Holdings, reported today that it has raised a total of $5 million in gross proceeds through the issuance of promissory notes from strategic investors and Board members, including the $3 million announced on September 17, 2025. The notes were issued with a 20% Original Issue Discount, such that they have an aggregate principal amount of $6,250,000 and mature on the earlier of six months or the date the Company completes a qualified equity financing of at least $10 million. The notes may be converted into equity, at each holder’s option, at the closing of a qualified equity financing, at the same per share price as such financing.

 Board of Directors member, Sandip Patel, led the final closing, investing $1 million into the notes and is joining AtlasClear Holdings as Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel.

 Sixth Borough Capital invested an additional $450,000 into the notes, bringing its total investment to $950,000. This marks its third investment following its recent $500,000 note purchase and a $500,000 debenture investment.

 Dawson James Securities acted as the exclusive placement agent.

 “This financing funded in material part by our own directors, underscores our confidence in the Company’s performance and trajectory,” said AtlasClear Holdings Executive Chairman John Schaible. “We are delighted to welcome Mr. Patel, a corporate attorney with a strong financial background who has chaired several public company audit committees, to our executive team as both General Counsel and CFO. Every member of our Executive Team and our Board of Directors has invested into our Company, which aligns the Board and the Shareholders.”

 “We are focused on building long term value and scale. By seeking to leverage exceptional fintech, our goal is to deliver a better model that bridges traditional finance with newer products like crypto,” added AtlasClear Holdings President Craig Ridenhour. “The material improvement of our balance sheet, the strong operating earnings from our wholly owned subsidiary, and the increase to our Stockholder’s Equity are all reasons to be excited about our Company.”
