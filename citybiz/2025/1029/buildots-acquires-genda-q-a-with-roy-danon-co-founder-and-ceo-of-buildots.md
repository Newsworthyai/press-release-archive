# Buildots Acquires Genda: Q&amp;A with Roy Danon, Co-Founder and CEO of Buildots

When Roy Danon co-founded Buildots with Aviv Leibovici and Yakir Sudry, they set out to solve one of construction’s most persistent challenges: the disconnect between what’s planned and what actually happens on job sites. Now, after raising $166 million and establishing Buildots as the global leader in AI-powered progress tracking, Danon and his team are taking an unprecedented step toward creating what he calls a “foundation model for construction” – acquiring workforce management platform Genda to unite two critical but traditionally siloed data streams.

 The acquisition marks a watershed moment for an industry that has long struggled with fragmented information systems. While Buildots revolutionized how contractors track progress through computer vision and AI, understanding the fuller picture of productivity requires connecting the dots between what’s being built and who’s building it. By bringing together Buildots’ progress intelligence with Genda’s workforce insights, Danon envisions a future where construction teams can finally answer the question that has eluded them: which strategies for reducing delays actually work, and why?

 As data centers, chip fabs, and other massive mission critical infrastructure projects proliferate globally, this vision for data-driven construction couldn’t come at a more crucial time.

 What led Buildots to acquire Genda?

 Buildots’ vision has always been to create a single, intelligent platform that connects every layer of project performance, from progress and productivity to workforce and beyond. As my co-founders and I pushed that vision forward, it became obvious to us that Genda shared the same DNA.

 Erez Dror, Genda’s founder and CEO, and I have known each other for years, and we both recognized that our companies were tackling the same challenge from different angles. Buildots specializes in tracking project progress and providing forecasts of potential delays, while Genda focuses on workforce management and safety. We acquired Genda to combine these insights and open the door to broader productivity intelligence.

 Although the industry has made significant progress in adopting technology, data about project progress and workforce insights are still often collected manually and fragmented across different systems. Combining Buildots’ and Genda’s insights will be a game-changer, helping teams see the connection between resources and progress, understand which methods for reducing delays actually worked, and rely on data to achieve continuous improvement.

 Why was this the right time for the acquisition?

 Erez and I have long discussed how our technologies could complement each other. Now, as the construction industry reaches a tipping point where enterprise adoption of tech (as opposed to pilots or project-level adoption) is becoming the norm, it felt like the right moment to make that vision a reality.

 In the AI era, access to accurate and high-quality data is key to creating meaningful impact for the customer. Uniting Buildots and Genda will enable us to offer our customers a single platform that combines workforce, productivity, and progress data – automatically generating insights that were previously out of reach at scale. Together, we can help the industry take a step toward greater standardization, consistency, and continuous improvement.

 What makes combining progress and workforce data such an important step for the industry?

 Successful construction delivery relies on adopting a performance-driven approach backed by objective data and insights. Buildots’ pioneering work in using AI to provide accurate progress, pace and delay risk insights fundamentally changed how contractors manage risk. However, a crucial piece of the productivity puzzle was missing – workforce data.

 This data often existed in disconnected systems (if it was collected at all), forcing teams to adopt cumbersome manual processes as they sought to understand what was really happening onsite.

 Buildots’ acquisition of Genda is the strategic move that finally closes that gap. It paves the way for realizing a vision that no one else has achieved – the complete unification of construction progress and workforce data on a single platform.

 How will this acquisition change what current Buildots customers experience?

 For now, the products will remain separate, and we’ll continue to sell them independently as long as there’s demand. Over time, however, we’ll begin to integrate insights from both systems. Ultimately, our goal is for our customers to access both progress tracking data and workforce insights within the same platform, and to analyze the connection between workers’ onsite activity and construction progress.

 

 How does Genda’s technology fit into Buildots’ existing platform?

 As mentioned, there’s tremendous value in getting a broader view of construction productivity. For example, the ability to identify which delay reduction strategies actually deliver results and which don’t.

 What role will the Austin office play within Buildots going forward?

 Austin is one of several hubs in the US where we’ll expand our presence in the upcoming months. That’s because Texas is seeing tremendous construction activity, especially around data centers. It’s also home to many of our customers.

 For this reason, we see a lot of value in Genda’s Austin presence, and having more boots on the ground there is a big plus. The Austin team will play an important role in supporting our clients locally and helping us strengthen our North American operations as we continue to scale.

 What do you mean by a “foundation model for construction”?

 When we talk about Buildots as a foundation model for construction, we’re talking about our vision of creating a single unified large data model based on a wide range of construction data sets, including progress, workforce and other data. We aim for Buildots to serve as a shared intelligence engine that unifies insights, automates analysis, and drives smarter, data-led decision-making across the industry.

 Where do you see Buildots heading over the next few years?

 We’re moving beyond isolated tools to build an enterprise platform that helps organizations benchmark productivity across projects and portfolios, identify opportunities for improvement, and drive continuous, data-led optimization at every level of delivery.

 At the same time, the broader market dynamics are shaping our direction. The boom in data centers, chip fabs, and infrastructure projects is creating unprecedented demand for the kind of precise, efficient management Buildots enables. We’re expanding teams with deep domain expertise in these high-growth sectors, as well as more traditional markets.

 Our goal remains to help construction shift from reactive, experience-based decision-making to a proactive, data-driven approach. Ultimately, it’s about achieving operational excellence so that the industry can meet the scale and complexity of the decade ahead.
