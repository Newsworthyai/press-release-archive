# Guignard Company Unveils a One-of-a-Kind Lending Library, “The Builder’s Book Nook”, to Inspire Future Generations of Construction, Engineering, Architectural and Surety Professionals

Guignard Company, a leading surety bond agency, is proud to announce the launch of its unique community lending library, The Builder’s Book Nook, located just outside its Longwood office at 1904 Boothe Circle. Its aim is to inform the community and individuals of all ages about potential career opportunities in construction, architecture, engineering and the surety industry, as well as foster curiosity, promote literacy, and inspire the next generation.

 The Builder’s Book Nook is more than just a place to explore books in these potential career opportunities; it is a visible commitment to workforce development and empowering people. It is stocked with a variety of books for all ages, with a distinct focus on materials that encourage an interest in construction, architecture, engineering, and surety, as well as skilled trades.

 “At Guignard Company, we understand that building strong communities means building opportunities,” said Bryce Guignard, President of Guignard Company. “We are in the business of surety bonds, but we are also deeply committed to building a brighter future. This library is a perfect example of how exposure and proper resources can spark a lifelong passion, allowing individuals to see themselves as the architects, builders, engineers, and surety providers of tomorrow.”

 

 The physical structure of the lending library is a testament to the hands-on learning achieved at the NAWIC Girls’ Construction Camp, a program designed to introduce high school girls to diverse and rewarding career paths in the construction industry. Guignard Company was actively involved in the camp, with Account Executive Kelly Phelan and Director of Business Development Mariel Coleman assisting the campers with various projects throughout the week.

 Guignard Company encourages local families, educators, and construction enthusiasts to utilize the resources at The Builder’s Book Nook and invites the community to support the initiative through book donations.
