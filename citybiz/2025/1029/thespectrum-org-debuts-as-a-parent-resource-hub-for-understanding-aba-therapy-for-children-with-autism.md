# TheSpectrum.org Debuts as a Parent Resource Hub for Understanding ABA Therapy for Children with Autism

Today, the Council of Autism Service Providers (CASP)—a national non-profit organization representing hundreds of autism service providers—launched TheSpectrum.org, an online resource for parents of children with autism. It provides a library of information, perspectives, and community support on Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) treatment.

 ABA is a treatment and teaching methodology often prescribed for children with autism. It’s based on decades of research into how people learn and what drives behavior.

 TheSpectrum.org includes conversations with parents, autism service providers, Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs®) and other autism experts, downloadable tools for informed treatment decision-making, and evidence-based research from the leading authorities on ABA’s effectiveness as a treatment for autism. Parents can also connect with a BCBA to ask general questions as they evaluate options for their children.

 As a treatment, ABA is highly individualized around each child’s strengths, autism-symptoms, and specific developmental challenges, as well as the family’s goals and preferences. ABA meets children where they are on the spectrum, and it can be provided in clinics, schools, homes, and community settings.

 TheSpectrum.org offers counterevidence to the widespread misinformation and negative narratives about ABA treatment that have proliferated online, particularly on social media. This misinformation often creates confusion and may deter families from exploring a treatment that, when properly applied, can significantly benefit a child’s development, especially during the crucial early years. It can help children progress in:

 * Communication.
* Language ability.
* Cognitive ability.
* Academic skills.
* Adaptive skills.
* Social interactive behavior.

 “ABA is an evidence-based treatment that’s helped countless individuals with autism,” said Lorri Unumb, CASP’s chief executive officer. “We created TheSpectrum.org to clarify the conversation and provide a platform where parents can find answers to their questions and hear directly from experts, fellow parents, and adults with autism.”

 “Receiving an autism diagnosis for your child is overwhelming, and it’s difficult to know where to turn for reliable information,” said Leslie Robinson, a South Carolina mother of a young child with autism. “Seeing these conversations and hearing from other families who’ve walked a similar path is incredibly reassuring. It gives you the information and confidence you need to make the best decisions for your child and family.”
