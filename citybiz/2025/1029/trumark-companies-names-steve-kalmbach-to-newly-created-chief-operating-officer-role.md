 Trumark Companies today announced that Steve Kalmbach has joined the company as its first Chief Operating Officer, a senior executive role created to further support Trumark’s vision of becoming the dominant regional homebuilder in the Western U.S.

 Kalmbach, who started his new role on October 27, will have executive oversight of M&A activities and operations for the company’s four divisions – Northern, Central and Southern California, and Colorado.

 “Adding a Chief Operating Officer to our executive team at this moment in time is essential to drive growth and sustain operational excellence across the company,” said Gregg Nelson and Michael Maples, co-founders and co-CEOs of Trumark Companies. “We are thrilled to have someone with Steve’s pedigree and passion to lead operations, and the vital M&A work we are pursuing for the future. We are pleased to welcome him to the team.”

 Kalmbach brings more than 30 years of real estate industry experience to the position, spanning residential, industrial, retail, and mixed-use development. He has held senior leadership roles in the industry for more than two decades, most notably as Northern California Division President for PulteGroup for 18 years, where he was instrumental in facilitating the sales and construction of almost 12,000 homes and delivering over $10 billion in revenue. Under his leadership, Pulte became the Bay Area’s largest builder of attached housing. Most recently, he served as President of Thomas James Homes in Southern California.

 He holds a Master of Business Administration in Finance from the Anderson School at University of California, Los Angeles and a bachelor’s degree in political science from the same university. He was inducted into the California Homebuilding Foundation Hall of Fame in 2021, has served on the Board of several industry organizations including California Building Industry Association (CBIA), BIA Bay Area, and HomeAid of Northern California, and was a multi-year advisor for Rebuilding Together Oakland. He is based in Trumark’s Southern California office.

 “Joining Trumark Companies and working alongside this talented team is a dream opportunity at this stage of my career,” Kalmbach noted. “Michael and Gregg have a remarkable reputation in this industry centered around integrity and values, and it is evident the company culture reflects their steady leadership. I look forward to contributing to Trumark’s continued success and helping to shape its future with the team.”
