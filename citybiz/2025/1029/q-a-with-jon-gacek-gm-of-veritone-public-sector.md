 What makes the recent sole-source contract with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) a significant milestone for Veritone?

 The sole-source contract with AFOSI is a game-changer for us and the broader adoption of AI in the public sector. This partnership allows us to deploy aiWARE and our Intelligent Digital Evidence Management System (iDEMS) for critical investigative work within the Department of Defense. The goal is clear: modernize the investigative workflow, improve data processing efficiency, and enhance intelligence delivery for personnel tasked with high-stakes missions.

 Our iDEMS solution prioritizes public safety over market competition by featuring an open architecture that integrates all types of evidentiary data from any source. From input to analysis to sharing, iDEMS provides a comprehensive suite of tools that enhance investigative workflows and solve critical cases in a secure and compliant environment.

 This milestone demonstrates our ability to not only meet but exceed the rigorous operational, security, and compliance standards of defense agencies. It also validates the trust government agencies place in our technology to deliver meaningful outcomes. What excites us most is how this partnership positions Veritone as a leader in government modernization efforts, paving the way for broader adoption of our solutions across other agencies and departments.

 What are some of Veritone’s AI-powered solutions that are addressing the unique needs of state and local government?

 Public safety officials, legal organizations, and justice agencies – they are all grappling with the growing challenge of managing vast amounts of multimedia data while meeting complex regulatory and privacy standards. Veritone’s AI solutions, such as Veritone Redact and Veritone Investigate, are purpose-built to address these unique challenges.

 For example, Veritone Redact streamlines the process of removing sensitive information – like Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or protected health data – from video and audio files. This is especially critical for public records requests, investigations, and compliance with federal and local privacy regulations. Redact eliminates manual redaction processes while increasing accuracy, minimizing errors, and helping agencies meet important deadlines by expediting the redaction of sensitive information within audio and video evidence.

 Veritone Investigate, a core component of our iDEMS solution, functions as a central hub for storing, managing, analyzing, and sharing all digital evidence files. It integrates with various cloud-based or on-premise data sources, such as 911 and video management systems, and can ingest diverse media types, including body-worn camera footage, surveillance footage, and jailhouse calls. By leveraging primary and advanced AI models, Investigate assists investigators in cataloging and tagging unstructured data within audio, image, and PDF evidence files, yielding actionable insights. It automatically runs primary AI models like transcription, object detection, facial detection, and scene classification, enabling agencies to efficiently search, discover, and catalog essential information to help expedite investigations.

 What trends in the public sector are driving demand for AI-powered tools?

 The demand for Veritone’s AI-powered tools comes from three main pressures: data volume, complexity, and the need for open, interoperable systems.

 First, agencies are generating more audio and video content than ever before, whether from body-worn cameras, surveillance systems, or public safety operations. Manually redacting or analyzing this data is no longer a practical solution. It’s too time-consuming, expensive, and error-prone. AI-powered tools automate these processes, ensuring both speed and accuracy.

 Second, privacy and compliance requirements are becoming stricter. Agencies must protect sensitive information both for legal compliance and to maintain public trust. Veritone’s tools help these agencies meet those standards with automated redaction workflows that include auditable logs, ensuring accountability and compliance at every step.

 And finally, there’s a growing emphasis on scalable, secure, interoperable solutions. Public sector agencies can’t afford to overhaul their entire tech infrastructure to adopt new tools. They need solutions that work with their existing platforms and scale as their needs grow. Our focus on interoperability ensures Veritone’s solutions integrate seamlessly and enhance efficiency rather than requiring expensive, disruptive changes.

 Lastly, what are Veritone’s strategic priorities within the public sector for Q4 and 2026?

 A major focus for the road ahead is to continue expanding the reach of our solutions across the public sector. We’re committed to scaling aiWARE and iDEMS deployments, particularly in defense, law enforcement, and public safety.

 Beyond technology, we will concentrate on forging deeper relationships with existing clients while building new partnerships across government agencies. Collaboration with leaders in law enforcement and government writ large is critical to not only scaling the adoption of our solutions but also ensuring they are integrated seamlessly into existing workflows. Ultimately, our goal is to enable government agencies to act with greater speed, precision, and confidence—making communities safer and more efficient through the power of AI-driven intelligence.
