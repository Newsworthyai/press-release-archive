# TestSprite Raises $6.7 Million Seed Round Led by Trilogy Equity Partners

TestSprite, the agentic testing tool for AI-native development, today announced the close of a $6.7 million seed round, bringing total funds raised to approximately $8.1 million. Trilogy Equity Partners led the round, with participation from both new and existing investors, including Techstars, Jinqiu Capital, MiraclePlus, Hat-trick Capital, Baidu Ventures, and EdgeCase Capital Partners. TestSprite is scaling to meet surging demand, growing 6X over the last three months, reaching over 35,000 users, following the launch of TestSprite 2.0 and its MCP server. The funding comes at a pivotal time, as the rise of AI-powered coding tools like Cursor, Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot accelerates development speed but creates a critical new bottleneck: testing and validating AI-generated code at scale. The oversubscribed round further cements TestSprite’s position as the testing backbone of the AI-native software development era.

 Gartner projects that 90% of enterprise developers will use AI-assisted tools by 2028, up from under 14% in early 2024, indicating a massive total addressable market (TAM) exceeding $30–50 billion in the coming years. Andrew Ng, a globally recognized leader in AI and co-founder of Google Brain and founder of DeepLearning.AI, noted, “As AI gets better at generating code, ensuring that code works as intended becomes even more important. Reliable evaluation pipelines are critical for scaling trustworthy AI systems.”

 “We’re witnessing a fundamental shift in software development. While everyone focuses on AI writing code faster, the real constraint is validation. TestSprite is the first to solve testing at the speed of AI, and the rapid growth quarter-over-quarter proves developers are desperate for this solution,” said Yuval Neeman, Managing Director, at Trilogy Equity Partners.

 “Writing code is no longer the hard part—the real challenge is ensuring it behaves exactly as intended,” said Yunhao Jiao, CEO and co-founder of TestSprite. “AI coding tools like Cursor have made development 10x faster, but they’ve also created a new risk bottleneck: testing and validation can’t keep up. TestSprite is the autopilot layer that turns AI-written code into production-ready software without the manual testing overhead that’s slowing teams down.”

 Many developers now find that vibe coding, building quickly with AI copilots, can become more frustrating and time-consuming than traditional development when debugging begins. TestSprite seeks to remove that pain entirely. Early adopters report cutting testing cycles from days to minutes, enabling teams to ship multiple releases per week instead of monthly.

 TestSprite’s autonomous agent works directly inside AI IDEs and through MCP integration, enabling test-driven development throughout the coding process, not as a separate phase after code is written. TestSprite integrates natively into developers’ workflows, allowing developers to test without context switching to browsers or separate testing platforms. Developers validate and refine code iteratively as they build, producing production-ready software at completion without leaving their development environment.

 TestSprite’s AI automatically generates frontend and backend tests, executes them, diagnoses failures, and proposes potential fixes through simple natural language commands. By enabling agentic testing where TestSprite’s AI agent writes, runs, and updates tests autonomously, it acts as an autopilot for software testing, dramatically accelerating developer velocity while maintaining quality.

 TestSprite plans to channel funds toward expanding its engineering team to deepen capabilities in test generation, AI-powered test healing, and intelligent monitoring, while scaling infrastructure to support teams deploying thousands of code changes daily. TestSprite aims to become the industry standard testing layer for AI-native development by mid-2026.

 About TestSprite Based in Seattle, Washington, TestSprite is building the testing backbone for AI-native software development. Its MCP server integrates directly into developers’ IDEs, enabling continuous, test-driven development where code is validated iteratively throughout the entire build process—not just after it’s written. By supporting agentic coding workflows, where AI can autonomously write, test, and validate code, TestSprite functions as an autopilot for software quality, helping developers ship production-ready software at AI speed. Today, TestSprite powers the workflows of over 35,000 users from leading companies, such as Google, Apple, Adobe, Salesforce, ByteDance, Microsoft, and Meta, building the next generation of AI-native applications.
