# Maryland is the 5th Most Affected by the Government Shutdown – WalletHub Study

With the U.S. government experiencing its 23rd funding lapse since 1976 – and its 11th actual shutdown – this time a partial one, the personal-finance company WalletHub today released its report on the States Most & Least Affected by the 2025 Government Shutdown to add some hard data to all the rhetoric.

 WalletHub compared the 50 states and the District of Columbia in terms of five key metrics, ranging from each state’s share of federal jobs to federal contract dollars per capita to the share of families receiving food stamps.

 Impact of the Government Shutdown on Maryland (1=Most Affected, 25=Avg.):

 * Overall Rank: 5th
* 1st – Share of Federal Jobs
* 1st – Federal Contract Dollars Per Capita
* 7th – Real Estate as a Percentage of GSP
* 16th – Access to National Parks
