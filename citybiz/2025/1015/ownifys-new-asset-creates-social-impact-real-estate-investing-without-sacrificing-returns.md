# Ownify’s New Asset Creates Social Impact Real Estate Investing, Without Sacrificing Returns

By helping a new generation of responsible renters purchase their first homes, Ownify is helping smart capital discover that big returns can accompany social impact when sharing ownership for mutual wealth creation. Ownify, the fractional homeownership platform rebuilding affordable housing access, today shares first proof points for the Ownify Home Fund, the vehicle through which capital partners can bridge the down payment gap plaguing too many Americans looking to buy homes. Since its 2023 launch, Ownify Home Fund investors have averaged 16% annualized returns on $7.5M in initial investments, while helping new homeowners close on the homes of their dreams. The opportunity is significant, with another $200M+ of “bricks” available across 509 pre-approved buyers in just its early test markets.

 “Most investors are told they have to choose between strong returns and meaningful impact, but we’ve built an investment opportunity that combines both,” said Frank Rohde, Founder and CEO of Ownify. “We built Ownify not only to give accredited investors the opportunity to funnel capital back to their local communities, but also to watch the financial returns grow through mission-aligned work. Our investors get to directly help responsible renters transition to ownership, creating a virtuous cycle where neighborhood stability drives investor prosperity.”

 Ownify’s proprietary AI tools make this new model possible; making homeownership accessible to more buyers while providing trusted risk mitigation for investors. This dual-focused approach delivers:

 * AI-driven Property Analysis and Underwriting: The platform’s proprietary AI agent analyzes individual properties to determine fair market value, appreciation, and income potential. For property / customer combinations that meet Ownify’s criteria, the agent then creates a personalized offer and bid strategy for the customer and their (real-life) agent.
* “Owen” AI Customer Service Agent: Ownify’s intelligent customer service agent handles complex homebuyer inquiries while continuously learning from each conversation. The system records past questions and feeds insights back into its knowledge base, creating increasingly sophisticated support for future customers.
* AI-Powered back office: Ownify’s AI agents automate individual property LLC setup, financial reporting, accounting, state filings, and tax preparation. Effectively managing individual LLCs allows Ownify to cost-effectively create bona-fide ownership interests (“bricks”) in each home.

 “Ownify caught my attention because they cracked the code on profitable community development, finding the financial alignment between credit-qualified buyers and investors looking for opportunities that drive real change,” said Eric Carlborg, Partner at Lobby Capital. “Their AI-driven LLC management tool eliminates the costly friction that made residential real estate investing too time and money intensive for many, and allows distribution of investment across multiple homes. The goal posts keep moving for today’s homebuyers, and Ownify makes it easy for those of us in a position to help to lower the barrier to entry. It’s a win for the buyer, it helps stabilize communities, and it’s showing a great early return. ”

 As the median American home price continues to grow across states, Ownify’s fractional ownership structure allows customers to participate in this appreciation while building equity from day one.

 “What distinguishes Ownify is their de-risked investment model, built on a pre-qualified pipeline of creditworthy buyers who have been eager to enter the market,” said Alan McIntyre, Former Head of Accenture Banking. “These are professionals with ideal financial profiles, what we’d characterize as ‘creditors’ dream’ candidates. With Ownify, investors don’t need to be wary of the typical trade-offs between returns and security. Instead, they can focus on building wealth while strengthening the communities they want to see thrive.”
