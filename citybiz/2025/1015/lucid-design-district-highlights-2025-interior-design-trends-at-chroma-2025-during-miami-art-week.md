# Lucid Design District Highlights 2025 Interior Design Trends at CHROMA 2025 During Miami Art Week

The Opening Reception for CHROMA 2025 – Vital Impulses in Contemporary Art will take place on Wednesday, December 3, from 4:00–7:00 PM (Miami Art Week/Art Basel) at Lucid Design District, 10 NE 41st Street, Miami, FL 33137. The exhibition continues through December 17, 2025, inviting art and design lovers to explore how contemporary artists are reflecting today’s most influential interior design trends. RSVP: Eventbrite Tickets

 Curated by Graciela Montich, CHROMA 2025 brings together 22 international artists whose works intersect with architecture, materiality, and sustainability. As design in 2025 emphasizes natural textures, craftsmanship, and wellness-driven spaces, this exhibition celebrates how art mirrors the same impulses shaping modern interiors.

 “Curating CHROMA 2025 through the lens of design highlights how art and interiors share the same emotional language,” says Graciela Montich, curator and participating artist. “Each artist interprets balance, texture, and space differently, yet all invite reflection on how our surroundings shape our inner worlds.”

 Where Art and Design Converge

 The 2025 interior design landscape embraces warmth, texture, and authenticity—values shared by this year’s participating artists.

 Cari Cohen (Miami) reimagines architectural materials such as concrete and plexiglass into sculptural compositions that balance rigidity and rhythm. Sebastian De La Paz (Ecuador/San Francisco), an architect and designer, brings a structural sensibility to painting, merging spatial geometry and emotional resonance.

 

 Vanessa Gilbert (Canada) and Graciela Montich (Argentina/Miami) exemplify sustainable luxury: Gilbert through the use of recycled and upcycled materials that evoke ecological mindfulness, and Montich through mixed-media works on linen that pair natural texture with refined craftsmanship.

 

 Mauro Arbiza (Uruguay) bridges art and architecture through sculptural forms that emphasize proportion, volume, and permanence—qualities aligned with design’s renewed focus on enduring craftsmanship. Sandra De Souza-Peixoto (Peru/Miami) and Nadine Vogel (Folly Beach, SC) contribute color-driven works that echo the wellness and personalization themes defining interiors this year.

 

 Together, these artists transform Lucid Design District into a dialogue between form and feeling—illustrating how art enhances the spaces we inhabit through harmony, tactility, and imagination.

 About Lucid Design District

 Founded by Payal Tak in 2021 and located at 10 NE 41st Street, Lucid Design District debuted as a gallery during Art Basel 2022. The space has since become a cornerstone of the Miami Design District’s art scene. Featuring 8 solo-curio spaces, an expansive reception gallery, and an outdoor installation wall, Lucid is dedicated to showcasing bold voices across all career stages. CHROMA continues to be its flagship exhibition during Miami Art Week.

 “After retiring from a high intensity career in technology five years ago I traded corporate America for an art gallery,” comments Payal Tak. “My mission was simple – to make available an easily accessible wall space for artists in a prime location. CHROMA continues to attract thousands of visitors during Art Week and Lucid continues to showcase the artists’ creations well into the following year, making it a very desirable platform for the artists to participate in and for art lovers to discover the undiscovered.”
