# Gurobi Signs Partnership Agreement With GRID

Gurobi Optimization, the leader in decision intelligence technology, today announced a new partnership with GRID, an AI optimization company specializing in infrastructure solutions.

 GRID is a rapidly growing company that develops AI optimization solutions for the infrastructure sector. After transitioning from the renewable energy business to AI, the company was selected for NEDO’s startup support program and successfully listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Growth Market in 2023. GRID leverages digital twins and deep learning to predict and optimize complex planning operations—including power generation facility scheduling and transmission network routing—contributing to infrastructure efficiency and decarbonization.

 The partnership combines GRID’s AI and digital twin expertise with Gurobi’s advanced solver technology to meet growing optimization demands in the energy and social infrastructure sectors, aiming to deliver more efficient and sustainable operations.

 Key goals of the partnership include:

 * Social Infrastructure Optimization: High-speed resolution of complex combinatorial optimization problems in power supply/demand, vessel scheduling, and transportation planning
* Digital Twin Integration: Optimization simulation on digital twins that precisely replicate real-world operations
* Proven Application Areas: Deployment across power/energy, shipping/logistics, and urban transportation sectors
* Skill Standardization: Automation of planning operations traditionally dependent on expert experience and intuition
* Cost Reduction: Improved operational efficiency and reduced operational expenses through optimization

 “Through our partnership with Gurobi, we will further evolve our prediction and optimization solutions to deliver even greater value to our customers,” said Ryosuke Umeda, CTO of GRID Inc. “We will actively promote partnerships that leverage both companies’ strengths toward the proliferation and practical application of mathematical optimization technology.”

 “With GRID as our partner, we are confident that we can extend the value of mathematical optimization technology to more customers across social infrastructure and other critical industries,” said Duke Perrucci, CEO of Gurobi Optimization. “By combining GRID’s advanced AI and machine learning technologies with our optimization technology, we can support the creation of even more innovative solutions.”
