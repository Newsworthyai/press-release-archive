 Meet the Local Owners

 Play It Again Sports Jefferson City is owned by the dynamic husband-and-wife duo, Phil and Nancy Minarik. Before becoming business owners, the Minariks were loyal customers, often in need of sports equipment as their kids stayed active. They were given an opportunity to bring a Play It Again Sports store to the Jefferson City community and they took it.

 Phil, who spent nearly three decades as a physicist before retiring early, was eager for a new challenge. Opening this business allowed him to learn a whole new set of skills and dive into the rewarding yet demanding world of entrepreneurship, expanding far beyond his scientific background.

 Nancy’s career has been defined by education. She worked as a physics professor for a few years before transitioning to homeschooling their four children. As a homeschool mom, Nancy has always been her own boss. With the kids now in school and Phil taking early retirement, this new venture gives her the opportunity to continue working independently while contributing to the success of their business.

 “As parents of kids who love sports, we understand how expensive sports equipment can get, especially since kids grow out of it so quickly,” said Phil. “That’s why we wanted to bring the brand to Jefferson City to offer parents a new option to buy top of the line equipment at a discounted price.”

 More about Play It Again Sports Jefferson City

 Play It Again Sports accepts new and quality used equipment from community members, allowing the gear to end up in someone else’s hands rather than a landfill. Unlike a typical consignment store, Play It Again Sports does not require appointments and pays on the spot for sports and fitness equipment it purchases from customers.
