# D1 Training Continues to Serve Wichita Athletes with Two Locations

D1 Training, a leading fitness enrichment concept utilizing the five core tenets of athletic-based training is serving athletes at its West Wichita location at 3801 N Ridge Rd. The group fitness facility employs a sports-science backed training regimen led by certified trainers to help people of all ages achieve their sport and fitness goals.

 Siblings Brian, David, and Paul Suellentrop and Jennifer Lines join a roster of impressive existing franchisees, including professional athletes like Kylie Fitts and Jordan Gay. Additional D1 partners include NBA star Chris Paul and Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow.

 In the fall of 2024, the Suellentrops introduced D1 Training to Wichita’s east side, marking the brands entrance into the city. With the addition of D1 Training West Wichita, they are expanding their reach to help athletes of all ages unlock their full potential. Committed to giving back to their hometown, the Suellentrops have made community involvement a cornerstone of their businesses.

 D1 Training West Wichita has already stepped up as a proud community supporter of the American Heart Association Walk that occurred on June 21, having raised over $2,000 to benefit the cause.

 “We are incredibly grateful for the warm welcome and support from the Wichita community,” said Paul. “Watching athletes grow both in skill and character through D1 Training is an honor, and we’re excited to see how our presence in Wichita continues to evolve.”

 D1 Training offers four age-based programs including Rookie (ages 7-11), Developmental (ages 12-14), Prep (ages 15-18) and D1 Adult. Each fitness program is based on the five athletic-based tenets: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down. Outside of group workouts, D1 Training offers group, semi-private, and one-on-one training with world-class coaches. The goal is simple: to continue to train athletes who are dedicated to their sport or fitness goals, regardless of age, or athletic background.

 Strategically expanding across the nation through franchising, D1 Training has more than 100 performance centers open with over 100 additional locations in various stages of development. The brand is currently seeking financially qualified business builders, former athletes, and entrepreneurs, who share a passion for fitness and youth sports, who are ready to make a positive impact on their community.
