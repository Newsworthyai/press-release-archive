# Q&amp;A with Barry Etra, President of Keiretsu Forum South-East: Strategy, Leadership, and Startups in Early-Stage Investing

The Southeast Investor Conference will take place July 29-30 at Georgia Tech, bringing together investors, fund managers, and innovation leaders for two days of insight, strategy and opportunity in early-stage investing. Co-hosted by Keiretsu Forum South-East, Georgia Tech’s Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC), and the Angel Capital Association (ACA), the event is tailored for accredited investors and ecosystem partners navigating a shifting investment landscape.

 We caught up with Barry Etra, President of Keiretsu Forum Atlanta, to learn more about what attendees can expect from the conference.

 Who is the audience for the Southeast Investor Conference?

 This two-day event is designed specifically for early-stage investors. We’re bringing together thought leaders, veteran angels and founders to explore today’s challenges and opportunities in investing.

 Why is this event particularly relevant right now in the early-stage investing world?

 We haven’t had an investor-focused conference in Atlanta in many years, if ever. We aim to bring 75-100 investors together for a day and a half of knowledge and later-stage company presentations, with the hope that we can educate and develop more investors. We all bemoan the lack of local investors, and we’re trying to do something about it.

 What are the most pressing challenges early-stage investors face in 2025, and how is the conference addressing them?

 There has been a dramatic drop-off in exits, as well as investment, as a consequence. The exit issue is critical because most investors are looking to recycle their money, and without exits, they have no free capital to reinvest.

 Obviously, more investors equal more investments. However, we also need to address the exit issue, and we will have speakers and panels specifically focused on it.

 How does the conference support innovation and entrepreneurship in the Southeast?

 We need new investors, and we are looking to educate and cultivate occasional investors. We hope established investors will also come to share their wisdom. There is a real opportunity to showcase great local companies on Day 1 and present other, more established companies on Day 2.

 What are the long-term goals for this conference? Do you hope to make it an annual event?

 We believe this conference should have existed years ago, so we hope this will become an annual event. We have had several Atlanta-based angel groups, including Atlanta Technology Angels, TiE Atlanta Angels and ATL TrailblazHER Angels, commit to bringing their members. We hope to have groups outside of Atlanta join us as well. We’re not looking to make money on the event, but rather our goal is to develop more and better investors.

 What actionable strategies or tools will investors gain from attending?

 There is an Angel Capital Association Workshop on Day 1 that provides an analysis of angel portfolio strategies designed to maximize returns and exits, while minimizing losses. We will host a session similar to Shark Tank to promote local companies.

 On Day 2, eight to ten companies with full due diligence packages will present to investors, and ACA president, Ron Weissman, will deliver a keynote on the current investing climate during lunch.

 Of course, we believe one of the most important elements of the conference is the opportunity to network with like-minded investors in a thoughtful and quiet environment.

 The conference is free to accredited investors. Please visit the Southeast Investor Conference to learn more.
