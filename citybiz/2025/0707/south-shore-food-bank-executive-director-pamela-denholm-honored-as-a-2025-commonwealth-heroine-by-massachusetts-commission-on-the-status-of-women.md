# South Shore Food Bank Executive Director Pamela Denholm Honored as a 2025 Commonwealth Heroine by Massachusetts Commission on the Status of Women

Pamela Denholm, executive director of the South Shore Food Bank, was recognized as a 2025 Commonwealth Heroine by the Massachusetts Commission on the Status of Women during a June 26th celebration at the Massachusetts Statehouse.

 The annual Heroine Award honors local women who demonstrate exceptional leadership and make meaningful contributions to their communities and the Commonwealth. As executive director of the South Shore Food Bank, Denholm plays a vital role in tackling food insecurity, working to improve food access on the South Shore, help address food equity across towns, and ensure families relying on local food pantries have fresh, nutritious options.

 Each year the Massachusetts Commission on the Status of Women partners with state legislators to identify women who make outstanding contributions to their organizations and communities. Each legislator is encouraged to submit one woman from their constituency as a way of recognizing their invaluable efforts.

 Denholm was nominated for the award by State Senator Patrick O’Connor (First Plymouth and Norfolk Counties). Selected by the Commission, she and other members of the Class of 2025 Commonwealth Heroines were honored for their contributions at the annual ceremony – an event that celebrates women who may not always make headlines but profoundly impact their communities.

 “It’s an incredible honor to be recognized as a Commonwealth Heroine, but this award is truly a reflection of the collective effort of so many people dedicated to tackling food insecurity,” said Denholm. “This award is a testament to the power of collaboration and the unwavering commitment to ensuring that no family in our region goes hungry.”
