# Family-Owned Sweet Paris Café Opens in University Park, Marking Continued DFW Growth

Sweet Paris Crêperie & Café, the ultra-popular restaurant brand specializing in sweet and savory crêpes, omelettes, waffles, salads, paninis, hot drinks and more, is now open for breakfast, lunch and dinner in University Park, located at 6632 Snider Plaza. The local community is welcome to visit the stunning new restaurant and enjoy the Art of Eating Crepes.

 The new Sweet Paris in Snider Plaza marks the second DFW location for the Hymes family: Edward Hymes Sr., his wife Cynthia, and their son, Edward Hymes Jr. Following the successful launch of their Southlake location in November of 2024, the longtime Texas residents are expanding their Sweet Paris footprint to University Park. With deep roots in the restaurant industry and years of leadership experience, the Hymes family brings both passion and professionalism to their growing business. Cynthia’s background in hospitality and hands-on experience running a family restaurant, combined with Edward Sr.’s executive franchise expertise and Edward Jr.’s role as area manager, make the new location a true family effort.

 “Our journey with Sweet Paris started as fans of the brand, and it’s been incredibly fulfilling to now grow with it as owners,” said Edward Sr. “This second location is a big milestone for our family, and it’s even more meaningful to build something lasting together.”
