# Oak Crest’s Performing Arts Center Undergoes Complete Transformation

By Danielle Rexrode

 Forget Broadway! When residents of Oak Crest, an Erickson Senior Living community in Parkville, Md., want to see a live show, musical performance, or even a movie, they simply walk down the hall to the on-site performing arts center.

 And now, after a recent renovation–including new carpet, seating, lighting, and sound–the 225-seat performing arts center in Town Center Clubhouse has been bustling with activity.

 “Having a performing arts center within the community provides a space where people can gather and meet one another through common interests,” says Joe Carlson, coordinator for the community’s in-house TV station. “In addition to attending concerts, speaker presentations, and movie screenings, residents can participate in live theatrical performances and even improv acting classes taught through the Community College of Baltimore County.”

 In the spotlight John Gregory, a former math teacher from Baltimore County, moved to Oak Crest in 2014 with the goal of trying some new hobbies in retirement.

 One of his first stops was the community’s TV studio, where he learned to operate cameras. This experience inspired him to join the Light and Sound Committee, which supports shows in the performing arts center.

 “There’s a lot more to lighting and sound than meets the eye, and most people don’t realize what goes on behind the scenes until something goes wrong,” says John, with a laugh.

 Shining a light John notes that the center’s new equipment has opened a world of possibilities.

 “We now have 16 lights covering the stage. We can do so much more than we could before, like changing the color and intensity. Each light can also be used as a spotlight,” he explains. “The renovations have completely transformed the facility. It turned out really nice.”

 “The changes are remarkable,” agrees Carlson, “and we have been making good use of the new technology. The lighting capabilities are great, allowing us to give every performance a polished, professional look.”

 The Light and Sound Committee, an all-volunteer group, also provides lighting and sound for two other venues on the 86-acre campus: the John Erickson Conference Center and the chapel.

 A showcase for talent Pianist and retired Baltimore County music teacher Keith Derrickson is another resident who appreciates the performing arts center’s recent upgrades. He recently performed Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue in the center to a captivated crowd.

 He also produces the community’s annual Follies show, which he started after he moved to Oak Crest in 2017. The variety show is held in the center and features residents who perform live songs and skits.

 “The Follies scripts are prepared in advance, and we conduct three rehearsals with script in hand. It’s meant to be funny, so if someone messes up their lines, it adds to the humor. My philosophy is it’s got to be fun; otherwise, it’s not worth doing,” says Keith.

 ‘A vibrant culture’ Carlson notes that the new performing arts center has generated lots of enthusiasm among current and prospective residents, who are excited about the idea of bringing friends and family to concerts and other events at Oak Crest.

 “The new performing arts center is just one of the incredible amenities that our residents enjoy,” says Carlson.

 “Residents can feel proud to bring in outside guests and speakers, as well as create their own informational and entertaining events.”

 “There is a vibrant culture here at Oak Crest. Having the technology to support that culture and encourage residents to explore their artistic expression on stage is a regular part of life here, and that’s pretty amazing.”

 More to the story A complete makeover of the Crestview Station Clubhouse was also part of the community’s ongoing enhancements. The project came to fruition after years of planning and development, informed by ideas and feedback from current and prospective Oak Crest residents.

 The updates are part of a multimillion-dollar investment from Erickson Senior Living to support the addition of enhanced amenities and services in its communities nationwide.

 Now, Crestview Station boasts a new lobby area, media lounge, group fitness space, upgraded dental suite, game room, creative arts studio, and hair salon.

 In addition, the Acorn Pub was expanded to include a new patio area that provides residents with a comfortable space to catch up with friends over an alfresco meal.
