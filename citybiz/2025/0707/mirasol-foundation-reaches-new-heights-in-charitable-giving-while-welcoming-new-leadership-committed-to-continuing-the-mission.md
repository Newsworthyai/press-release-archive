# Mirasol Foundation Reaches New Heights in Charitable Giving While Welcoming New Leadership Committed to Continuing the Mission

The Mirasol Foundation, Inc. is proud to announce a record-breaking year of charitable giving, awarding more than $720,000 in grants to 49 local nonprofits throughout Palm Beach County. With a deep focus on serving those most in need—families and children in crisis, veterans, food insecurity, and the unhoused—the Foundation continues to grow both in generosity and community impact.

 This milestone year also marks a seamless transition in leadership as Ed Glassman steps into the role of Foundation President, following the dedicated service of Marilyn Wilson, who led the organization through a transformative two-year period of growth. Glassman’s appointment ensures the Foundation’s continued momentum, with a renewed focus on transparency, outreach, and hands-on volunteerism.

 “Under Marilyn Wilson’s leadership, the Foundation has made tremendous progress,” Glassman said. “As the incoming President, I hope to help build on that success and am honored to have this opportunity.”

 A Banner Year of Giving

 In FY2025, the Mirasol Foundation exceeded its $700,000 fundraising goal, collecting over $760,000 in donations from more than 375 generous donors. These funds translated into impactful grants ranging from $10,000 to $40,000, including support for five newly selected organizations.

 Top recipients included:

 * Palm Beach County Food Bank
* Wounded Veterans Relief Fund
* Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies

 “The mission of the Mirasol Foundation is to support others in Palm Beach County who need help,” said Glassman. “It is amazing to see how people in Mirasol step up, and the Foundation continues to work and grow because of their generosity.”

 Central to the Foundation’s effectiveness is its Gifts & Grants Committee, which has grown from 9 to 30 committed volunteers. This year, the committee evaluated 80 proposals, personally visiting each nonprofit, reviewing financials, and assessing alignment with the Foundation’s core mission: fighting hunger, easing homelessness, supporting veterans, and helping struggling families and children.

 This grassroots approach ensures that donations are directed where they’ll have the greatest impact, and that the Foundation remains closely connected to the real needs of the community it serves.

 Community Service

 Under the leadership of both Wilson and now Glassman, the Mirasol Foundation has also dramatically expanded its community service initiatives, turning charitable giving into direct action. In 2025 alone:

 * Over 125 volunteers, including many teenagers, contributed more than 375 hours of service
* 4,500 pounds of food were collected, translating into 3,500 meals
* A van full of diapers and formula was donated, benefiting 1,000 babies
* More than 3 tons of clothing were distributed to the homeless
* Dozens of boxes of books were collected for local children through teen-led drives

 Looking Ahead

 The Foundation also launched MFI-TV, a series of short videos playing at the clubhouse reception area that highlight supported charities and show residents the real-world impact of their contributions. In addition, the Foundation has added a new Development Committee and continues to strengthen its infrastructure to support long-term growth and strategic fundraising.

 Reflecting on her term, Wilson shared, “I am overwhelmed by the support and kindness shown by the Mirasol community. I know that the foundation will continue to grow and make an impact on the lives of those in need in Palm Beach County.”
