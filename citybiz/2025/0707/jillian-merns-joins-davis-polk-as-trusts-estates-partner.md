 “Jillian has deep experience providing sophisticated advice across the spectrum of trusts and estates matters to high-net-worth individuals,” said Neil Barr, Davis Polk’s Managing Partner. “With private wealth increasingly prevalent in and important to business transactions and structures, welcoming Jillian will further our position as a destination firm for our high-net-worth clients. And as we continue to materially grow our funds practice, Jillian’s strong background in planning with private fund interests will be key to support our clients in this space. I am pleased to welcome her to Davis Polk.”

 Ms. Merns has deep experience in all aspects of estate planning and administration, with an emphasis on the development of sophisticated plans for high-net-worth individuals and their families.

Ms. Merns also advises clients on the creation of single family offices and works with many family offices on an ongoing basis to provide comprehensive solutions to the complex issues facing today’s wealthiest families. She joins Davis Polk from Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, where she was a partner in the Private Wealth Group.

 “Jillian is an extremely well-regarded trusts and estates adviser with an impressive client roster,” said Paula Ryan, co-head of Davis Polk’s Trusts & Estates practice. “She has very strong experience advising clients both on planning with private funds interests and in family office formation and advisory work. I am delighted to lead our team with her.”

 Ms. Merns said, “Davis Polk has an unrivaled platform and reputation for excellence, and I am honored to join the esteemed Trusts & Estates team. I look forward to working with colleagues across the firm to deliver innovative and effective strategies to our clients on their most sophisticated trust and estate matters.”
