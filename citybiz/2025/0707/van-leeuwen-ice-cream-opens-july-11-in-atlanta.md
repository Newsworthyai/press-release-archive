# Van Leeuwen Ice Cream Opens July 11 in Atlanta

Beloved NYC Brand Celebrates Grand Opening with $1 Scoops, Free Totes, and a Special Collaboration with Bomb Biscuit Co.

 Van Leeuwen Ice Cream, the nationally beloved brand known for its cult-favorite dairy and vegan ice cream, is opening its first Atlanta scoop shop on Friday, July 11 on the ground floor of 619 Ponce, the newly opened four-story mass timber building at Ponce City Market.

 “Atlanta has been on our radar for a while, and we’re so excited to finally plant roots here,” said Ben Van Leeuwen, co-founder and CEO. “We believe great ice cream starts with great ingredients, and we can’t wait for Atlantans to experience what we’re all about.”

 “We’re thrilled that Van Leeuwen has chosen Ponce City Market for its Georgia debut and are excited to see one of NYC’s beloved brands bring their simple, good ice cream to Atlanta,” said William Morgan, Senior Vice President of Asset Management, at Jamestown.

 To celebrate the grand opening on July 11, Van Leeuwen is offering $1 scoops from 11 a.m.-1 p.m., and the first 100 guests will receive a free Van Leeuwen tote bag. The new shop will also debut a limited-time collaboration sundae with MICHELIN-recognized Bomb Biscuit Co., a local favorite known for its bold, buttery biscuits.

 

 The Van Leeuwen Bomb Biscuit sundae (pictured below) features one scoop of Van Leeuwen Honeycomb, half of a Bomb Biscuit chocolate chip biscuit, salted caramel and whipped cream.

 “Collaborating with Van Leeuwen for this sundae has been such a fun and delicious experience,” said Erika Council, founder of Bomb Biscuit Co. “It brings together two of my favorite things—ice cream and biscuits—and I’m excited to share this playful treat with Atlanta.”

 Van Leeuwen is nationally known for its creative seasonal flavors and unexpected collaborations with Hidden Valley Ranch, Kraft Macaroni & Cheese and BIGFACE Coffee Affogato in partnership with NBA All-Star Jimmy Butler.

 About Van Leeuwen Ice Cream

 Van Leeuwen began as a yellow scoop truck on the streets of NYC in 2008 by Ben Van Leeuwen, Pete Van Leeuwen and Laura O’Neill, who were on a mission to make good ice cream from good ingredients that makes you feel good. Their French-style ice cream (made with more than double the amount of egg yolks as standard ice cream) quickly gained a loyal following. Van Leeuwen has since expanded and has scoop shops in New York, California, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, DC, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Texas, Tennessee, Florida and now Georgia. Pints, ice cream bars and ice cream sandwiches are available in grocery stores across the country and to order for nationwide shipping from their website.
