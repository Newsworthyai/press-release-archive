His rare combination of experience in both areas will be invaluable to our market-leading platform. As restructurings and distressed financings continue their sharp upward trajectory, Eugene brings significant depth—particularly on the lender side—positioning us to meet the incredible global demand from our clients.”

 “Gibson Dunn’s momentum is palpable, and I’m excited to join a growth-minded and incredibly ambitious team to supercharge my practice,” said Eugene. “Gibson Dunn has built its restructuring practice—representing both debtors and creditors—into a leading global powerhouse that is best positioned for today and the future. Having worked across the table from Gibson Dunn lawyers, I know firsthand the team’s impressive bench strength, collaborative approach, and unparalleled market knowledge. I look forward to working alongside my new colleagues to guide clients through complex restructurings.”
