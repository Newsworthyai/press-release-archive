# Q&amp;A with Arvind Chary, CEO of Atlas Real Estate Partners

Atlas Real Estate Partners has executed more than $1.7 billion in transactions to date. What factors have contributed most to the firm’s growth and success in the multifamily space?

 Atlas’s success is rooted in a disciplined, people-first investment approach and a hyperfocus on high-growth secondary markets in the Southeast. Since 2009, we’ve built a 10,000+ unit portfolio by pairing strategic market selection with conservative underwriting and operational excellence. Rather than chasing speculative valuations during the 2021-2022 cycle, we stayed selective—preserving long-term value by focusing on properties with strong fundamentals, positive leverage, and fixed-rate debt. This foundation has allowed us to raise our first discretionary value-add fund, and expand our internal capabilities. It’s given us a position of strength in a market where many firms must play defense.

 How has Atlas’s investment strategy evolved over the past few years, and how are you positioning the firm to navigate current market conditions?

 Over the past two years, Atlas has evolved into a vertically integrated multifamily investment platform with in-house execution across acquisitions, development, construction management, and capital markets. That shift—combined with the close of our first discretionary value-add fund—has positioned us to pursue $1 billion in acquisitions across 12–15 assets over the next 3–5 years. In today’s landscape, with valuations down 20–30%, favorable supply/demand forecasts, and $497B in multifamily loan maturities coming due, we’re leaning into this moment. Our existing portfolio is fully fixed or hedged, and we’re actively sourcing distressed and off-market deals through long-held relationships. It’s a moment that rewards preparedness—and we’re ready to capitalize.

 What markets or regions are you most focused on today, and what makes those areas attractive for multifamily investment?

 We’re focused on fast-growing, diversifying, and economically resilient markets in the Southeast and Texas —Savannah, Charleston, Southwest FL, Tampa, Nashville, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Orlando—places where we’ve had a presence and know the players on the ground. These cities offer the kind of durable tailwinds multifamily investors look for: job growth, population inflows, infrastructure expansion, and favorable tax environments. In Savannah, for example, Hyundai’s $10B “Metaplant” is bringing 14,500 new jobs to the region. In Charleston, a $3.5B battery plant is reshaping the local economy.And in Nashville, Hines and AJ Capital are collectively developing ~30 acres in Wedgewood-Houston, transforming it into one of the city’s most dynamic emerging neighborhoods Meanwhile, corporate relocations continue .

 How do you balance accelerating acquisitions with disciplined risk management, especially in today’s high-interest-rate environment?

 Risk management is in our DNA—and it’s one of the reasons we’re in growth mode today. Our entire value-add portfolio is either on fixed or hedged debt, with an average remaining term of 53 months. We’ve always prioritized stable capital structures, even when others leaned into high-leverage floating-rate debt. Internally, we maintain robust financial controls, conservative underwriting, and proactive asset management that includes being on site often and collaborative oversight of our third-party property managers. We also operate with substantial property reserves and a long-term hold mindset. That defensive posture gives us the confidence to move quickly when the right opportunities arise—without sacrificing our downside protection.

 What differentiates Atlas from other private multifamily investment firms, particularly when it comes to sourcing deals and managing assets? What has been your competitive advantage?

 Atlas’s competitive edge is our local-focused, vertically integrated model. We are not generalists chasing every trend, market, or asset class. Rather, we specialize in value-add multifamily with deep roots in select Southeast markets. We use our long-standing local relationships and market intel to source off-market deals, and our in-house teams manage everything from physical renovations to operational repositioning. Every asset we touch is intentionally curated for its optimal resident base, whether that means smart-home tech, co-working spaces, or dog parks. We’re not just renovating units—we’re building community. That long-term, resident-centric approach is baked into our operations and has helped us consistently outperform across cycles.
