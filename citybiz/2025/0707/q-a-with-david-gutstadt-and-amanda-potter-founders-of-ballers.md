# Q&amp;A with David Gutstadt and Amanda Potter, Founders of Ballers

David Gutstadt and Amanda Potter are the founders of Ballers, a new social sports and hospitality concept rolling out across 50+ locations nationwide in the next 7-10 years, with its first location debuting in Philadelphia this month. Longtime collaborators in both life and business, the duo began collaborating while developing Equinox Hotels and later went on to co-lead the creation of Fitler Club – David as founder and Amanda as head of design – shaping one of the most comprehensive private clubs in the country.

 As Ballers CEO, David, brings deep expertise in hospitality, real estate, and finance, with past roles at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Related Companies. Amanda, serving as Ballers Chief Creative Officer, is also the founder of Good City Studio, a Philadelphia-based hospitality firm specializing in membership clubs and wellness, whose team is leading the brand development, design, and execution of the Ballers experience. Together, David and Amanda are redefining how people play and connect through athletics.

 Tell us about your background and what led you to create Ballers?

 David: We got our start in the wellness space with world-renowned lifestyle brand Equinox and its hospitality arm, Equinox Hotels. We then went on to create Fitler Club in Philadelphia, which was the first club of its kind to combine world-class entertainment, social, wellness and business offerings under one roof. After nearly a decade of building in this space, and becoming life partners along the way, we realized there was an opportunity to take everything we loved about sport, design, hospitality, and culture, and bring it into a new kind of social club. Ballers is the result of that vision. We are building these venues to create a place that feels personal, energizing, and intentionally designed for connection through movement.

 What gap did you see in the wellness and sports space, and how is Ballers looking to fill that gap?

 Amanda:’Social wellness’ concepts have been on the rise in recent years, and it’s been incredible to see how other brands have fused elevated design, self care and human connection within the wellness space. What sets Ballers apart is our mission to build community around shared passion for sport and friendly competition, along with thoughtfully curated cultural experiences. Country clubs were and still are a place to exercise, socialize and play sports; but they typically lack sophisticated art and design. Ballers celebrates the rich legacy of country club sports (racquets and golf) and weaves in high design and social & cultural activations, creating a high-energy atmosphere fueled by camaraderie and friendly competition.

 What guided your decision in selecting your initial launch cities and what made Philadelphia and Boston stand out to be your first Ballers locations?

 David: We’re launching in cities where we can either build on an existing racquet sport legacy or introduce something entirely new – places where there’s real momentum around active lifestyles and community connection. Philadelphia was a natural choice for our flagship location. It’s the center of squash in the U.S. and home to one of the most important squash institutions globally, with a passionate, tight-knit racquet sports community. We already had a strong base there through Fitler Club, and the response to our Ballers pop-up showed us our community was ready for something bigger. Our second location, Boston, offers a chance to set the standard for padel in the city. By bringing the first padel courts to Boston, we’re able to shape the future of the sport in one of the country’s most iconic sports towns.

 ‘Social Wellness’ is resonating with people right now – why do you think that is?

 David: People are rethinking how they spend their free time and are looking to move, connect, and feel good, all in one experience. We are creating something that feels fresh and intentional, with world-class sports facilities, high-touch hospitality, wellness amenities, and inviting social spaces. Ballers is a place where you can hit the court, recover in the sauna or cold plunge, grab a well-made cocktail, and catch up with friends – all under one roof. Our venues reimagine what a social sports club can be, rooted in movement, community, and culture.

 How will Ballers foster community and socialization amongst locals and travelers who come to experience the venue?

 Amanda: Our spaces encourage interaction at every level. Beyond the physical design, we’re tapping into the local creative scene to curate art, music, and cultural programming that gives each venue a sense of place. In Philadelphia, for example, we’ve assembled a board of local creatives who will meet quarterly to help curate unique experiences at Ballers such as DJ nights, art exhibits, and fashion pop-ups, adding another layer to our core sports offerings. We believe that by tapping into the local creative community in every Ballers city, we can craft experiences that feel one-of-a-kind.

 Share more about the design of Ballers spaces and how it will impact the way people reconnect with sports.

 Amanda: The design of Ballers is about more than just aesthetics. It’s about storytelling, memory, and emotion. We’re transforming historic buildings with strong character into high-performance, high-design venues that feel both energizing and personal. Our brand flagship in Philadelphia is situated within a historic power station that was built one hundred years ago to generate electricity for the city of Philadelphia. Throughout the space we’ve layered in industrial minimalism with nostalgic textures, family references, and personal memories. For all Ballers locations, our interior design approach weaves in personal touches and motifs inspired by the founding team’s own experiences, reflecting our unique stories, memories and the people in our lives who shaped them. For example, the copper objects on our bar shelves are an homage to mom, who sold copper for extra cash before I was born. That warmth and intentionality creates an environment where people feel at ease, inspired to move, and open to connection. Our hope is that these unique personal touches will evoke a sense of home within Ballers.

 Amanda: Local culture is everything to the Ballers experience. We believe in adaptive reuse, not just for sustainability purposes, but because these spaces come with stories. In each city, we choose iconic or overlooked architectural gems and honor their past while giving them a new purpose. We work with local artists and creatives to infuse each location with a distinct vibe that reflects its surroundings. From the design language to the events calendar, we are ensuring that Ballers locations all feel rooted in movement, design, and culture.

 With the recent surge in racquet sports, how do you envision this trend evolving over the next few years, and what role will Ballers play in its progression?

 David: Racquet sports, specifically pickleball and padel, have moved beyond trend status into a full-blown lifestyle. We’re seeing new generations embrace these sports not just for fitness, but for community and routine. Ballers is leaning into that momentum by creating spaces where racquet sports are central, but surrounded by experiences that make people want to stay. We see Ballers playing a pivotal role in shaping what the next wave looks like as we continue to grow into new cities, blending competition with culture, and sport with design, to create destinations people return to again and again.
