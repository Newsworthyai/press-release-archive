# Acclaimed Filmmaker Jon M. Chu to Direct “Hot Wheels” Live-Action Motion Picture from Mattel, Warner Bros. and Bad Robot

Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ: MAT), a leading global toy and family entertainment company and owner of one of the most iconic brand portfolios in the world, and Warner Bros. Pictures today announced that acclaimed director Jon M. Chu (Wicked, In the Heights, Crazy Rich Asians) will direct the live-action Hot Wheels feature film based on Mattel’s legendary and timeless toy car. Writing partners Juel Taylor and Tony Rettenmaier will pen the script (Creed II, They Cloned Tyrone) with J.J. Abrams’ Bad Robot Productions and Chu’s Electric Somewhere producing.

 Inspired by the world’s best-selling toy*, the high-octane action film will bring the beloved, multi-generational Hot Wheels franchise to life, showcasing some of the world’s hottest and sleekest vehicles.

 Robbie Brenner, President of Mattel Studios and Chief Content Officer, said: “Jon’s ability to craft rich, elaborate worlds with a distinct point of view makes him the ideal storyteller to bring Hot Wheels to life. His films are visual spectacles—true eye candy—but what sets them apart is how he weaves unforgettable narratives within those stunning frames. Paired with Juel and Tony’s compelling storytelling, this team is uniquely positioned to capture the heart, adrenaline, and spirit of Hot Wheels, a leading brand in car culture.”

 Jon M. Chu added: “Hot Wheels has always been about more than speed – it’s about imagination, connection, and the thrill of play. Bringing that spirit to the big screen is an incredible opportunity. I’m excited to partner with Mattel Studios, Warner Bros. Pictures, and Bad Robot to create an adventure that honors Hot Wheels’ legacy while driving it somewhere entirely new.”

 J.J. Abrams commented: “We already felt incredibly lucky to collaborate with Mattel on this special film. Having Jon, Juel and Tony come aboard takes our excitement to a whole new level.”

 Jesse Ehrman, President of Development and Production, Warner Bros. Pictures, said: “Jon is a visionary director and an incredible partner to Warner Bros. We are thrilled to have him join us, along with the talented writing duo of Juel and Tony. With our collaborators at Bad Robot and Mattel Studios, we can’t wait to bring Hot Wheels to life on the big screen.”

 Most recently, Chu directed Universal Pictures’ critically acclaimed Wicked, starring Oscar-nominated Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. Part 1 of the feature-film adaptation, released on November 22, 2024, became a box-office hit, earning over $700 million globally and becoming the highest-grossing Broadway adaptation in domestic box office history. Chu’s recent projects also include the acclaimed In the Heights for Warner Bros. and the worldwide hit Crazy Rich Asians.

 Juel Taylor and Tony Rettenmaier are a writing and directing duo who have worked on projects like Creed II and They Cloned Tyrone, the latter of which marked Taylor’s directorial debut.

 Robbie Brenner is producing for Mattel Studios alongside Jon M. Chu, J.J. Abrams, and Michael Bostick. Arturo Thur de Koós is overseeing for Mattel Studios, with Sheila Walcott and Zach Hamby leading for Warner Bros. Pictures, Jon Cohen for Bad Robot, and Jane Lee overseeing for Electric Somewhere.

 With Hot Wheels, Warner Bros. brings together two major partners, Bad Robot and Mattel, for the first time. Bad Robot has been a creative partner of Warner Bros. for nearly 20 years and is currently producing an animated feature-length adaptation of Dr. Seuss’s iconic Oh, the Places You’ll Go!, which Chu is also set to direct, among other projects for Warner Bros. Mattel Studios and Warner Bros. Pictures previously collaborated on Barbie, the highest-grossing film of 2023 and Warner Bros.’ highest-grossing film ever, receiving over 450 nominations including eight Academy Awards® nominations.

 Led by two-time Academy Award nominee Robbie Brenner, Mattel Studios’ vision is to collaborate with leading creators to make standout quality content based on Mattel’s iconic brands that will resonate in culture and appeal to global audiences.

 Chu is represented by Artists First, UTA, Goodman, Genow, Schenkman, Smelkinson & Christopher (GGSSC), and ID PR.
