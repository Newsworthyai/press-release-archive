# Bernie’s Book Bank Partners with Newcastle Systems to Accelerate Book Distribution

Bernie’s Book Bank, a nonprofit that transforms children’s lives through book ownership by sourcing, processing, and distributing free high-quality books to children who need them most, has partnered with Newcastle Systems, a pioneer in workplace mobility solutions, to scale its book distribution efforts and improve operational efficiency across its warehouse.

 This partnership brings together Bernie’s Book Bank’s mission to empower children through books with Newcastle Systems’ commitment to optimizing distribution workflows through its flagship mobile-powered cart technology. By integrating a Newcastle mobile-powered workstation into Bernie’s Book Bank’s operations, the nonprofit can streamline book sorting, inventory management, and packing processes—ultimately getting more books into the hands of children faster.

 “Partnering with Newcastle Systems enhances our warehouse logistics and gets more books into the hands of the children who need them most,” said Tommy Lacher, Director, Information Technology & Supply Chain at Bernie’s Book Bank. “The mobile-powered cart allows us to be precise the first time, enabling one person to accomplish what previously required several people, and has reduced our inventory time.”

 Newcastle Systems’ mobile-powered cart allows employees and volunteers to bring power and data directly to the point of task, reducing unnecessary movement, improving accuracy, and increasing productivity. Customizable and easy to implement, the cart is already proving instrumental in helping Bernie’s Book Bank staff process more books, more efficiently.

 “At Newcastle Systems, we design our technology with people in mind—making work easier, faster, and more empowering,” said Kevin Ledversis, VP of Sales at Newcastle Systems. “Partnering with Bernie’s Book Bank is a perfect fit. The employees are on the front lines of helping children thrive through literacy, and we’re proud to support their mission with tools that boost the human impact of their efforts.”

 Together, Bernie’s Book Bank and Newcastle Systems are setting a new standard for how nonprofit logistics can be both efficient and human-centered, ensuring that every child has access to the transformative power of books.

 Today, Bernie’s Book Bank proudly serves 315,000 local children throughout Chicagoland, with hopes that the number will continue to grow. “By getting books into children’s homes, we build lasting community, create meaningful connections, spark contagious joy, and change our lives and theirs,” said Brian Floriani, founder of Bernie’s Book Bank.
