# NanoGraf Appoints Thomas Redd as Chief Executive Officer

NanoGraf, the largest silicon oxide anode material producer in the United States, today announced Thomas Redd as Chief Executive Officer. Dr. Francis Wang, who has led the company since 2015, will remain at NanoGraf as a technical advisor.

 Redd’s appointment marks NanoGraf’s transition from R&D-driven growth to full commercial execution. He will direct the company’s expansion into new civilian markets, deepen existing defense partnerships, and oversee the ramp-up to large-scale domestic production at NanoGraf’s Chicago manufacturing facilities.

 “NanoGraf combines three attributes that make scaling compelling: a defensible technology platform, an execution-tested team, and clear market momentum,” said Redd. “With a fraction of the capital raised by some peers, Francis and the team have already validated next-generation battery performance in the toughest field conditions. The task now is to manufacture at scale and meet demand.”

 Redd brings more than 25 years of leadership in clean technology, advanced manufacturing, and resource-recovery businesses. As CEO of Continuus Materials, he commercialized a process that converts mixed plastic and fiber waste into composite roof-board products.

 “Building and leading this team of accomplished and committed researchers and operators as CEO has been the great honor of my career,” said Wang. “We’ve made great progress getting next-gen battery technology into the hands that need it, and I’m excited to support Tom as he takes the reins. With the NanoGraf Board, I looked long and hard for the right person to lead NanoGraf in this new era of commercialization and manufacturing, and we found Tom to be the perfect fit. I’m proud of how far NanoGraf has come since I joined in 2015, and I am even more excited about where we’re going next.”

 Redd joins NanoGraf following a number of recent milestones for the company. Since 2024, NanoGraf:

 * Ranked #25 on TIME’s list of the Top 250 GreenTech Companies of 2025.
* Launched Onyx, a next-gen silicon anode material that dramatically improves lithium-ion battery performance at cost parity with synthetic graphite.
* Was awarded $60 million by the U.S. Department of Energy to create one of the world’s largest silicon anode facilities in the Midwest.
* Shipped its silicon anode batteries to Thales Defense & Security, Inc., extending runtime for military communications in the field.
* Completed first large volume production run to supply the military with more powerful, resilient batteries.
* Partnered with South 8 Technologies on a $6.4 million U.S. Army contract to advance domestic lithium-ion battery production.
* Opened a new R&D facility in Chicago to develop more powerful batteries.
* Was awarded up to $15 million by the U.S. Army to provide lighter, longer-lasting batteries to the military.

 Wang, who joined as CEO in 2015, led the company through a period of intense technical advancement, commercialization, and recognition.
