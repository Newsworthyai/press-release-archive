# Parter Raises $5.5M Led by StageOne Ventures

Parter, the AI-powered company helping hardware teams – from engineering and supply chain to R&D – manage complexity and stay ahead of disruption, today announced $5.5 million in seed funding. The round was led by StageOne Ventures, with participation from Zenda Capital, Mercer Ventures, and notable angel investors including former Sequoia partner Shmil Levy, executives from Cisco, Ariel Maislos, and founders of Avalor, Datorama, Epsagon, and Innoviz. The funding will support Parter’s product development, go-to-market expansion, and U.S. growth as the company officially launches out of stealth.

 Hardware manufacturing is under pressure. With supply chain instability including tariff-driven price hikes and fragmented systems, it has become harder than ever to bring products to market. According to a 2024 survey of more than 500 manufacturing leaders, 98% reported persistent challenges with disconnected and incomplete data, leading to delays, cost overruns, and lost opportunities.

 With shifting trade policies and increasing pressure to reshore production, hardware teams must adapt fast. Parter gives them the tools to manage complexity, reduce risk, and move from reactive fixes to proactive decision-making.

 “Our customers are under pressure from every direction. Data is siloed, teams are disconnected, and global instability makes everything harder,” said Asaf Israelit, co-founder and CEO of Parter. “We built Parter to bring clarity. Our platform connects data, teams, and decisions so hardware companies can streamline their operations and move with confidence – all thanks to AI.”

 Parter helps hardware teams move beyond scattered spreadsheets, outdated tools, and manual processes. Instead of reacting to problems after they happen, teams can proactively manage risk, act faster, and make smarter decisions with help from AI. Whether it’s a tariff, shortage, compliance issue, or supply chain bottleneck – Parter delivers the insights needed to keep production moving and teams aligned.

 The platform unifies product and supplier data from BOMs (Bill of Materials), datasheets, ERP and PLM systems, PDFs, and spreadsheets into one clean, structured system. AI agents validate, enrich, and link that data to generate real-time insights and recommendations. Capabilities include risk and compliance monitoring, auto alternatives for impacted components powered by AI agents, predictive alerts for obsolescence and tariffs, sourcing and quoting automation, and collaboration tools for cross-functional teams.

 Parter serves the full spectrum of electronics producers, including OEMs, ODMs, EMS, and contract manufacturers in sectors like IoT, communications, automotive, and defense.

 “Parter is solving a massive, overlooked problem,” said Tal Slobodkin, managing partner at StageOne Ventures. “This team is applying AI where it’s desperately needed, turning operational chaos into strategic clarity, equipping businesses with the essential tools they need to bring their hardware manufacturing to the U.S. or nearshore accordingly. It’s a game-changer for hardware companies and couldn’t be more timely.”

 “Parter has completely transformed how we manage sourcing and quoting,” said Hila Arditi, VP Supply Chain at RH Group, a global electronics manufacturer with facilities in the U.S., Europe, and Israel. “By automating manual steps and simplifying our procurement process, Parter has helped us respond faster to customer needs and navigate today’s complex supply chain landscape with confidence.”

 Parter was selected as one of just 25 startups globally to join the prestigious Palantir Foundry-backed Accelerator Programme The cohort is designed to support AI-native startups working in complex and data-rich industries, further validating Parter’s unique approach to hardware intelligence.
