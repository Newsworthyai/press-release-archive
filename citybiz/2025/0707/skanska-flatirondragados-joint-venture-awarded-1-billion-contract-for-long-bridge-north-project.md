# Skanska-FlatironDragados Joint Venture Awarded $1 Billion Contract for Long Bridge North Project

Skanska, a leading global construction and development firm, and FlatironDragados, a leading infrastructure company, have been awarded a $1-billion contract by the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority (VPRA) to build the Long Bridge North Project. The approximately one-mile rail link will stretch from East Potomac Park to Washington D.C.’s L’Enfant Interlocking. It is the first of a major two-phased construction initiative that will expand freight and passenger rail service and integrate local, regional, and national transportation networks.

 The Long Bridge North Project is part of the larger 1.8-mile Long Bridge Project that will replace and enhance the busy rail corridor from Washington, D.C. into Arlington, Virginia with a series of linked, four-track modern rail bridges and corridors replacing the aging two track system. The project’s refurbished eastern tracks – which currently serve freight and passenger traffic – will primarily serve CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT) freight rail. The newly built western tracks will cater mainly to passenger services provided by the Commonwealth’s state-supported Amtrak Virginia service, Amtrak’s long distance service, and Virginia Railway Express (VRE).

 “Skanska is proud to be leading the construction team and work for the Long Bridge North Project, which will vastly improve freight and passenger rail service in the Capital Region,” said Michael Viggiano, executive vice president, Skanska USA Civil. “With funding in place and planning and approvals now complete, this highly complex and critical infrastructure project is shovel ready.”

 The Skanska-FlatironDragados JV’s work on the Long Bridge North Project includes replacing the existing two-track rail corridor with a four-track system, stretching from the southern limit near the shore of the Potomac River, through East Potomac Park, across the Washington Channel, and ultimately connecting to L’Enfant Interlocking.

 “FlatironDragados is pleased to transition from planning to construction with our partners Skanska and VPRA on a project that will improve rail service in this important region,” said Jim Schneiderman, executive vice president, FlatironDragados. “Through collaboration from day one, we have optimized a complex project to minimize construction risk and to enable greater schedule and cost certainty.”

 Construction is set to begin in July 2025 and comes with an anticipated completion date of Q4 2030.

 The Skanska-FlatironDragados Joint Venture is supporting the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority (VPRA) in delivering this critical project in collaboration with CSXT, Amtrak, VRE, District Department of Transportation (DDOT), National Park Service (NPS), the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and other agencies overseeing the project area.
