# TEDxReisterstown Launches Inaugural Event, Showcasing Baltimore Leaders and Entrepreneurs

TEDx of Reisterstown, Maryland, welcomed several Baltimore natives, leaders, and entrepreneurs to give TED Talks at their first ever annual event, “Reimagine: Next is Now.”

 TED is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that believes in the power of ideas and sharing those ideas with others on an international scale. In line with the TED mission, localized and independently-owned events known as “TEDx events” have become popular.

 TEDx is a regional initiative, allowing for speakers to share their ideas on a smaller scale. Founder and lead organizer of TEDxReisterstown, Christine Brogdon, said she launched the initiative to see more inclusion and local leadership being celebrated in Baltimore County and further.
