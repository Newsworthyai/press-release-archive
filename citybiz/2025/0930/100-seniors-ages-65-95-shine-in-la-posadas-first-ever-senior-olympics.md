# 100+ Seniors, Ages 65–95, Shine in La Posada’s First-Ever Senior Olympics

Have you ever seen a 95-year-old in the Olympics? La Posada Senior Living just made that possible. The community hosted its first-ever, three-day-long “La Posada Fun and Games Olympics,” where more than 100 residents, ages 65 to 95, competed in friendly, fast-paced, and surprisingly competitive events. From corn toss and Wii bowling to a ½-mile pond race, bridge, Rummikub, and even a jelly bean tasting, these Olympians proved that age is just a number—and that everyone can be a champion in their own way.

 The event was spearheaded by 81-year-old resident and former PE teacher Marty Weiss. Marty, who lives with Parkinson’s, continues to inspire his peers to stay active. His idea to create friendly competition between La Posada’s three buildings quickly gained momentum, turning into a community-wide celebration filled with camaraderie, energy, and joy.

 Staying active is critical for seniors’ physical, mental, and emotional well-being, and the Senior Olympics provided a creative outlet for movement, social interaction, and connection. The La Posada Fun and Games Olympics highlighted how a sense of purpose and play can spark engagement and bring a community together.

 The event drew an outstanding turnout, with more than 100 residents signed up to compete across the games. Families and spectators gathered to cheer on the Olympians, while La Posada staff supported and encouraged participants throughout the event.

 The first-ever Senior Olympics at La Posada set the stage for a new community tradition, proving that it’s never too late to be an Olympian.
