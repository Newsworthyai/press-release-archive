# Cornerstone and Stonesthro Partner to Enhance UK Digital Resilience and Sovereignty with Zadara Cloud Technology

Cornerstone today announced a partnership with Stonesthro, a UK-based edge cloud provider, and Zadara, a global leader in fully managed cloud services, to explore new ways of bringing compute and data closer to where they are created and used.

 The partnership aims to provide solutions for national challenges, from improving data sovereignty and security to supporting low-latency AI applications and strengthening the UK’s digital backbone.

 By combining Cornerstone’s national infrastructure, Stonesthro’s sovereign edge capability and Zadara’s cloud technology, the partnership will examine how edge computing can unlock new performance, sustainability and resilience benefits across industries.

 Solving for the UK’s next phase of digital transformation

 As demand for data-intensive and AI-driven services grows, organisations across sectors, including public sector, healthcare, finance and critical national infrastructure, face mounting pressure to balance latency, sovereignty, scalability and sustainability.

 This partnership aims to provide solutions that:

 * Reduce latency by processing data closer to the source for faster, real-time insights.
* Support sovereignty and compliance by ensuring data is governed under UK law.
* Enable scalability through flexible, distributed infrastructure that adapts to demand.
* Advance AI-readiness with NVIDIA GPU-optimised multi-tenant platform for emerging workloads.
* Improve sustainability through more energy-efficient, lower-carbon edge deployment models.
* Enhance resilience by distributing workloads to reduce single points of failure.

 A partnership focused on UK innovation

 Pat Coxen, CEO of Cornerstone, said: “This partnership brings together three complementary strengths: national infrastructure, digital innovation and artificial intelligence, to explore how the UK can build greater trust and resilience into its digital systems. It’s about finding practical solutions to some of the UK’s most pressing connectivity and compute challenges.”

 Ashley Sellar, CEO of Stonesthro, said: “By combining the flexibility of edge with the assurance of UK sovereignty, we have an opportunity to redefine how organisations approach performance, compliance and sustainability in the cloud.”

 Yoram Novick, CEO of Zadara, added: “We are proud to partner with Cornerstone and Stonesthro to expand access to Zadara-powered sovereign AI clouds. Together, we are enabling UK organisations to build scalable and secure IT foundations that unlock the power of AI while ensuring resilience and digital sovereignty.”

 Driving innovation through collaboration

 The collaboration reflects a shared commitment to strengthening the UK’s position as a leader in digital infrastructure, ensuring that the next generation of cloud and AI services are secure, scalable and sustainable by design.

 By uniting connectivity, compute and security at the edge, the three organisations will help create the conditions for a smarter, safer and more resilient digital future for the UK.
