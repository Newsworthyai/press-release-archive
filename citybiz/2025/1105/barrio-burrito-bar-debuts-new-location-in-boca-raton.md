 Meet the Local Owners:

 The Boca Raton Barrio Burrito Bar is owned and operated by business partners Pranav Vankawala and Prateek Shrestha, experienced multi-unit franchise owners who bring more than a decade of restaurant and business management expertise to the community. When the pair discovered Barrio Burrito Bar, they were drawn to its operational simplicity, fresh ingredients, and flavor-forward menu that allows every guest to create their ideal meal.

 “We wanted to bring something fresh and exciting to Boca Raton’s fast-casual dining scene,” said Vankawala. “Barrio Burrito Bar combines bold flavors, fresh ingredients, and customization in a way that fits perfectly with Boca Raton’s vibrant, food-loving culture.”

 The new 1,100-square-foot restaurant offers both indoor and outdoor seating and employs a team of 15 local staff members. With an elevated yet approachable menu, guests can customize every part of their meal, from bases like Mexican rice or lettuce to proteins such as slow-roasted carnitas or fajita veggies. Eight signature sauces, including Bang Bang and pineapple salsa, complete the experience and allow every meal to be tailored to taste.

 The restaurant’s vibrant and welcoming atmosphere makes it the perfect spot for lunch breaks, family dinners, or casual nights out. Guests can dine in, order ahead online, or choose delivery through third-party apps. Those looking to make the most of their visit can also join the Loyalty Rewards Program to access exclusive offers and enjoy a complimentary order of chips and queso with their first sign-up.
