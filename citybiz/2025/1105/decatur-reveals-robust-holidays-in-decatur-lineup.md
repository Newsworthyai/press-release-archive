Downtown Development Authority Sets Weekly Events and Special Promotions

 The Decatur Downtown Development Authority (DDA) announced a wide-ranging list of holiday initiatives intended to bring cheer to all, including weekly “Terrific Thursday” events and ongoing holiday shopping promotions encouraging people to support local businesses this season.

 Beginning Thursday, Nov. 6 – and continuing on select dates through December – “Terrific Thursday” will run from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and feature a different activation each week, all developed through collaboration between the DDA, community groups and local businesses:

 * Nov. 6 – City of Decatur Official Ornament Unveiling at Vivid Boutique
* Nov. 13 – Early bird shopping photos with Santa all around Downtown Decatur
* Nov. 20 – Pet photos with Santa and Mrs. Claus at Harmony Park in Oakhurst
* Dec. 4 – Annual Tree Lighting, featuring caroling and free hot cocoa and gingerbread cookies at the Historic DeKalb Courthouse/DeKalb History Center
* Dec. 11 – Bonfire and Marshmallow Roast, with caroling from The Talley Street Chorus on The Square
* Dec. 18 – Screen on the Green: Happy Feet with free popcorn at Ebster Recreation Center

 “We are excited to welcome locals and visitors alike to Downtown Decatur this holiday season, as our team has worked hard to ensure we truly have something for everyone,” said Conor McNally, chair of the Decatur Downtown Development Authority. “Beyond ‘Terrific Thursday’ and our festive events, we have seen new restaurants open their doors and existing retailers make substantial investments to enhance the guest experience. We are ready to put our best foot forward every day of the week during the most joyful time of the year.”

 Other holiday events and promotions include:

 * The “Shop Early, Shop Local” promotion is offering a $20 gift card to a City of Decatur restaurant for every $200 spent at local retailers in the month of November.
* A “Gingerbread Takeover” will see local shops decorating giant cookie cutouts with their own festive flair.
* Letters to Santa – which may even get a response – can be dropped off at three locations: the Decatur Visitors Center, Kelly’s Market and Oakhurst Market.
* On Small Business Saturday (Nov. 29), shoppers can take pictures with Santa on The Square, enjoy free milk and cookies, and take advantage of free gift wrapping.
* To celebrate the first night of Hanukkah, a menorah lighting with free hot drinks and latkes will be held in The Square on Sunday, Dec. 14 at 4:30 p.m.

 An ongoing backdrop during the holiday season will be the $8.5 million evolution of Decatur Square, which has been under construction since the spring and is accelerating toward an April 2026 reopening date, just in time for FIFA World Cup 2026. The reimagined Square will be the center hub of Decatur WatchFest ‘26, a 34-day free soccer and music festival with many opportunities for residents and visitors to enjoy matches at Decatur’s pubs, restaurants, and public spaces. It kicks off June 11 with a concert featuring Big Boi of Outkast. For more details on Decatur WatchFest ’26, visit DecaturWatchFest26.com or @decaturwatchfest26 on Facebook.

 About the Decatur Downtown Development Authority

 The Decatur Downtown Development Authority (DDA) was founded in 1982 to implement the Decatur Town Center Plan and to provide day-to-day management of the downtown development program. Since that time, our role has expanded to include responsibility for all of Decatur’s commercial districts. The Downtown Development Authority works with the traditional, downtown business district and the Development Authority has jurisdiction over the neighborhood districts. Both Authorities share a board and staff and exist to provide assistance to prospective business owners and developers interested in investing in Decatur’s economic development plans. These programs are housed within the City’s Community & Economic Development Department.
