# Swoozie’s Reopens in Buckhead, Ready to Celebrate Every Moment in Style!

Swoozie’s, the specialty store known for making life’s moments even more memorable, announces the reopening of its original shop on Roswell Road in Buckhead. Beloved as Atlanta’s favorite destination for entertaining must-haves, stylish gifts, party-perfect finds and personalized stationery, Swoozie’s is back with a refreshed look, expanded product assortment and a renewed promise to serve the community it has cherished for more than two decades.

 The newly reopened Swoozie’s was designed to feel like stepping into a party waiting to happen. Bright pops of pink and orange set the tone as shelves brim with colorful cocktail napkins, sparkling stemless glasses, chic serving pieces and thoughtful gifts ready to be wrapped on the spot. Whether a bridal shower, a birthday party, or just a Tuesday in need of a little sparkle, Swoozie’s ensures every guest shows up with the perfect gift. With its blend of stylish finds and personal service, the brand has become a trusted partner making ordinary days a little more festive.

 Swoozie’s began in Atlanta in 2001, when David Dworkin and Kelly Plank-Dworkin set out to create a store focused on making celebrations stylish and personal. Today, that legacy continues with their daughter, Ashley O’Donnell, who is now at the helm of the company. Under her leadership, Swoozie’s honors its family roots while guiding the brand into a new era of growth and creativity. “Reopening our Buckhead store is about so much more than retail – it’s about reconnecting with the people who have supported us over the years,” said Owner Ashley O’Donnell. “We’re deeply grateful for this community’s partnership and eager to carry the Swoozie’s story forward into its next chapter.”

 The refreshed Buckhead location expands on Swoozie’s signature offerings, featuring personalized stationery that transforms thank-you notes into keepsakes; monogrammed totes and accessories for meaningful gifting; and curated party goods that turn everyday gatherings into Instagram-worthy events.

 Since first opening its doors, Swoozie’s has grown into more than just a store – it has become a gathering place for women seeking inspiration, creativity, convenience and connection. With deep ties to the local community, the brand will continue to bring joy through curated products, personal service and its signature spirit of celebration.
