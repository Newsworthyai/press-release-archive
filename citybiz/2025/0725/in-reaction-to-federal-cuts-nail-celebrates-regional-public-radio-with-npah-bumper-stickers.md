# In Reaction to Federal Cuts, Nail Celebrates Regional Public Radio With NPAH Bumper Stickers

With years of experience working with public media companies—most recently with its award-winning rebranding for WBUR—Nail Communications watched the recent draconian cuts to public media with horror.

 “Public media is the crown jewel of a journalism ecosystem that is already under extreme duress,” said Alec Beckett, Creative Partner. “So we couldn’t just sit back and watch it get knee-capped.”

 So that’s the bumper sticker we made. It’s free to anyone who wants one at www.NPAH.org

 The goal is to remind people that public media is not a monolithic entity. Rather, these are local operations—big and small—that serve their local communities with meaningful journalism, storytelling, and entertainment. And as one of the billboards Nail created for WBUR said, their job is as simple as it is essential, which is to ‘Tell the truth and tell it well.’

 “With the government cutting off crucial funds to NPR, we wanted to remind everyone of the importance of their local public media institutions. And for those of us in New England, we don’t call it ‘NPR’, we call it ‘NPAH’,” added Beckett.
