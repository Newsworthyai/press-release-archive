# Rumble Boxing Co-Founders Launch “The Pack” A First-Of-Its-Kind Boutique Street Defense-Inspired Group Fitness Experience in NYC

Rumble Boxing co‑founders Noah Neiman and Andy Stenzler announced the launch of The Pack, an innovative boutique fitness studio combining strength training, high‑intensity cardio, and street/self-defence in a single dynamic, 50‑minute group workout. Slated to open in early August 2025 at 49 W 23rd Street (between 5th and 6th) in Manhattan’s bustling Flatiron/Chelsea fitness corridor, The Pack represents a bold evolution in group fitness. It’s a battleground of self-betterment where discomfort is embraced, community is forged, and leaves you prepared for whatever life throws your way.

 Drawing on their success with Rumble Boxing, Neiman and Stenzler designed The Pack to integrate three core components:

 1. Strength & Core Training – State-of-the-art TECHNOGYM benches, dumbbells, resistance bands, and brass knuckles.
2. Endurance Conditioning – Rogue Assault Bikes – there’s nothing better for a body shaping functional workout. Low impact, high yield.
3. Street Defense & Striking – BOBs (Body Opponent Bags): the most productive tool for building real world skills.

 Classes are crafted to foster functional strength, cardiovascular health, and confidence in self‑defense, all while delivering a high‑energy communal experience.

 The Pack’s branding features a “Cerberus”-inspired three‑headed dog logo, symbolizing its trio of fitness modalities and Neiman’s pet dogs. Participants can proudly wear The Pack merchandise, reinforcing a united, inclusive community — a contrast to what Neiman describes as the “cliquish and transactional” nature of some boutique studios.

 To amplify the immersive experience, The Pack has partnered with Grammy‑award‑winning producers to develop a signature “boiler‑room” soundtrack. The brand also plans collaborations with local run clubs, major health and fitness names, and music industry figures, alongside community‑driven philanthropy initiatives.

 ‘”The Pack is the next chapter in the story I’ve been telling for over a decade,” says Noah Neiman, Co-Founder of The Pack. “First in the red room at Barry’s, where I’d sneak in boxing combinations between sprints and strength sets. Then with Rumble, where we built an entire experience around the skill, power, and poise of the sweet science… all while making it accessible and wildly fun.”

 The Pack is set to open its doors in early August 2025. Pre‑sales will go live on July 15, offering early access to classes and memberships. The studio’s opening location is strategically selected near Rumble’s original 2017 site, with Neiman recalling their launch milestone of over 650 daily attendees — a benchmark they expect to match.

 About The Pack: Founded by industry veterans Noah Neiman and Andy Stenzler, The Pack is built on the belief that fitness should empower, educate, and unite. Each session delivers tangible self‑defense skills, elite physical conditioning, and a strong sense of community in an inclusive environment. The brand’s launch signifies a new chapter in boutique fitness—one that champions real-world functionality and connection above all.
