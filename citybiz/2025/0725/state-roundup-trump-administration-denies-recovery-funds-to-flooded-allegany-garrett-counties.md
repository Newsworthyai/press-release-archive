# State Roundup: Trump Administration Denies Recovery Funds To Flooded Allegany, Garrett Counties

TRUMP DENIES RECOVERY AID TO FLOODED ALLEGANY, GARRETT COUNTIES: President Donald Trump’s administration denied Maryland’s request for emergency funds to help Allegany and Garrett County communities still recovering from a historic flash flood in May. Gov. Wes Moore said Wednesday the state will appeal Trump’s decision. Brenda Wintrode and Sapna Bansil/The Baltimore Banner.

 * Moore is seeking $15.8 million in disaster relief funds from FEMA to pay for repairs after extreme rainfall from May 12 to 14 caused water to rise to a historic 12.4 feet in Georges Creek, which spilled over and forced evacuations in Allegany and Garrett counties. Schoolchildren were ferried to safety by boat. The floods damaged more than 200 homes, numerous businesses, roads, bridges, railroads, sewer systems, drinking water and public utilities in several Western Maryland towns, including Westernport. Katie Shepherd/The Washington Post.
* State leaders said they plan to appeal FEMA’s denial of disaster assistance for Western Maryland communities slammed by flooding in May. The bad news, delivered in what one official called “just a basic letter that said you were denied,” contrasted sharply with President Donald Trump’s effusive announcement on social media Tuesday that FEMA had approved $11.7 million in disaster assistance for areas of West Virginia hit by flooding and tornadoes in June. “It’s definitely a gut punch and it hurts,” said Republican Western Maryland state Sen. Mike McKay. Bryan Sears/Maryland Matters.

 DEL. MOON DRAFTS BILL TO REQUIRE STATE TO REDRAW MAPS EARLY: As President Donald Trump pushes Texas and other states to redraw congressional district maps to benefit Republicans, a top Democrat in Maryland wants to push back. Del. David Moon, majority leader in the Maryland House of Delegates, says he’s drafting legislation that would require that if other states engage in out-of-cycle redrawing of congressional districts, then Maryland would be required to as well.

 HIGHER ED PANEL WARNED OF BIG CHANGE IN FINANCIAL AID UNDER TRUMP ACT: Maryland Higher Education Commission members were warned Wednesday of a potential “huge sea change” for the state’s financial aid systems, as Pell Grant eligibility shifts as a result of changes under the “One Big Beautiful Bill” act.

 NEW STATE HEALTH SECTY FOCUSES ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: Dr. Meena Seshamani says she’s focused on behavioral health and other priorities as she passes her 100th day heading the state’s Department of Health, though she avoided direct answers to many of The Sun’s questions on major health topics during a wide-ranging interview Wednesday. Brooke Conrad/The Baltimore Sun.

 WHAT IS THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION? Maryland lawmakers established the Public Service Commission in 1910, following the lead of other states like New York. The regulatory body was formed to balance powerful utility companies and the public’s need for reliable, safe and affordable service. But some critics say the commission doesn’t ask utility companies tough enough questions, or simply doesn’t understand the scope of costly projects that are funded by ratepayers.

 ‘DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST’ DELEGATE SEES YOUTH SHIFT TOWARD HIS VIEWS: As self-described “Democratic socialist” candidates are seeing greater success in races around the country, one Maryland lawmaker who embraces the label believes Democratic Party voters are shifting in his direction. Del. Gabe Acevero represents Montgomery County in the General Assembly. As the electorate becomes younger and more progressive, Acevero said that establishment Democrats should “be cognizant” of what that constituency wants if it plans to win elections.

 LAWMAKERS SEEK TO REMOVE NAME OF SEGREGATIONIST FROM FOUNTAIN: Local lawmakers, Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen and U.S. Reps.

 * Daniel Fuentes Espinal has been pastor of Iglesia del Nazareno in Easton since 2015 — he is also an undocumented immigrant who fled the violence in his native Honduras in 2001 and put down roots on the Eastern Shore where he has ministered and raised a family. Fuentes Espinal has no criminal record and has been trying to get approrval to become a U.S. citizen, said his daughter. Rosanne Skirble/Maryland Matters.
* Espinal has three children and a large extended family that he cares for, Diaz said. Tred Avon Strategies principal Len Foxwell referred to him as a pillar of the community.
