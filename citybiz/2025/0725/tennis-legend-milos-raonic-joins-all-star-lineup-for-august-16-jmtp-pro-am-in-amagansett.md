# Tennis Legend Milos Raonic Joins All-Star Lineup for August 16 JMTP Pro Am in Amagansett

Limited Tickets Still Available for 11th Annual Fundraiser Supporting Johnny Mac Tennis Project’s Mission to Promote Equity, Access, and Opportunity for Underserved Youth

 Wimbledon finalist Milos Raonic is the newest addition to the 11th Annual JMTP Pro Am taking place Saturday, August 16, 2025, at SPORTIME Amagansett. Raonic will join John and Patrick McEnroe, Marion Bartoli, James Blake, Bob and Mike Bryan, Mary Joe Fernandez, and Tommy Haas for a fun afternoon of friendly competition with a serious purpose.

 The fundraiser, recognized as the world’s largest one-day Pro Am, pairs tennis legends with amateurs across eight competitive flights to raise critical funds for the Johnny Mac Tennis Project (JMTP). JMTP, a not-for-profit organization, helps to eliminate economic and social barriers for children in under-served and under-resourced neighborhoods by providing access to the sport as well as scholarships to the John McEnroe Tennis Academy (JMTA). Since its founding in 2012, JMTP has introduced the sport of tennis to over 16,000 New York City youngsters and provided over 500 means-tested scholarships that have allowed young players to attend JMTA.

 Amateur and spectator tickets are available for purchase at proam2025.givesmart.com. Doors open at 1:00 pm; the event begins at 2:00 pm. In addition to the tournament, attendees can bid on rare auction items and experiences and connect with the tennis community in a lively and vibrant atmosphere. Space is limited. Food and refreshments will be available.

 “We’re so excited to have Milos Raonic joining this year’s Pro Am,” said Ryann Cutillo, Executive Director of the Johnny Mac Tennis Project. “These legendary players show up not just because they love the game, but because they believe in what we’re doing – making tennis accessible to kids who wouldn’t otherwise have the opportunity to play. Their support sends a strong message about the importance of access and opportunity in tennis.”
