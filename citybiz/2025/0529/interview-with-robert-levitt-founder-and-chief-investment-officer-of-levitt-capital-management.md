# Interview with Robert Levitt, Founder and Chief Investment Officer of Levitt Capital Management

Robert Levitt is the founder and CEO of Levitt Capital Management, a boutique investment advisory firm headquartered in Nice, France. With decades of experience in financial services, Levitt has carved out a unique niche specializing in advising American expatriates living in Europe. His firm addresses the complex financial and regulatory challenges faced by U.S. citizens abroad, including dual taxation, restrictions on investments, and compliance with both U.S. and European laws.

 Levitt previously operated a successful investment advisory firm in Florida, managing private accounts and hedge funds with a membership threshold of $3 million. In 2007, he expanded operations into Europe to serve South American clients seeking alternatives outside the U.S. However, following regulatory shifts and the global financial crisis in 2008, the European branch was closed. Recognizing an underserved market for American expats in Europe, Levitt reestablished operations in 2021 to meet growing demand for specialized financial advice.

 An expert in international taxation and investment regulations, Levitt has been deeply involved in policymaking discussions as the Deputy Chair for Tax Policy of the Democratic Party’s Americans Overseas Taxation Task Force. He has access to legislative developments affecting expatriates, including proposals like residence-based taxation that could eliminate double taxation for U.S. citizens abroad.

 Levitt’s firm currently serves clients across nine European countries and is rapidly expanding to meet demand from regions such as Sweden and the Czech Republic. His expertise spans navigating country-specific tax treaties, understanding local retirement products (e.g., French IRAs), and ensuring compliance with European regulations like MiFID II and FATCA. Fluent in French, Levitt has passed rigorous exams required to operate legally within European financial markets.
