# David Schneider Interviews Aric Coffman, CEO of P3 Health Partners

Dr. Aric Coffman is a dynamic physician leader with a deep-rooted passion for physician enablement and healthcare transformation. His unique blend of clinical expertise and business acumen, coupled with a relentless dedication to advancing healthcare, underscores his commitment to shaping the future of medicine.

 Dr. Coffman’s journey spans across the healthcare continuum, beginning with his surgical residency at Lovelace Medical Group in Albuquerque, NM, where he later assumed roles as Chairman of Surgery, Chief Medical Officer, and President of DaVita Medical Group New Mexico. It was during this time that he began to hone his leadership and passion for guiding organizations from fee-for-service to value-based care.

 His career trajectory led him to the Pacific Northwest, where he integrated The Everett Clinic, a large multispecialty practice, with an independent physician association, driving remarkable growth and profitability.

 Dr. Coffman’s journey continued as he navigated the complexities of healthcare mergers and acquisitions, spearheading growth initiatives along the I-5 corridor from Oregon to Canada. His tenure included the Optum acquisition of DaVita Medical Group by Optum, adding The Polyclinic, a large Seattle-based multispecialty practice, to the portfolio of accountabilities. His tenure in the Pacific Northwest showcased his ability to drive organizational success through shifts from fee-for-service to value-based care models.

 His quest to revolutionize healthcare delivery led Dr. Coffman to lead Honest Medical, a startup dedicated to empowering patients and clinicians. As CEO, he led the company from inception to significant milestones, securing substantial funding and scaling operations to serve more than 120,000 Medicare lives across two states. Under his leadership, Honest Medical implemented innovative clinical care models, resulting in tangible improvements in patient outcomes and cost management.

 Through his work, Dr. Coffman continues to inspire transformative change, empowering healthcare professionals to realize their full potential and driving meaningful impact across communities.

 Consistent record of outperforming benchmarks regardless of style. David Schneider‘s skillsets include strong fundamental analysis, macroeconomics, and unusual quantitative skills. These tools are applicable within all sectors. Independently created an embedded expectations system in 1985, prior to the widespread acceptance of the concept by Wall Street. Established #1 performance record in the nation for 1, 3, and 5 year returns at Pacific Century Advisors in San Diego – a combination never duplicated by any firm. Hedge Fund in 1999 was also #1 in USA. Specialties: Exceptional knowledge in small cap, quantitative screening, and “embedded expectations” investing in multiple sectors with a particular expertise in healthcare. What is unusual is that I have helped create index beating results in both value and growth styles.

 Interview questions:

 Q1: Most people are not familiar with P3. What people are familiar with are their primary care doctors, Medicare, and insurance companies. Can you explain where P3 fits in this mix?

 Q2: You have not been with the company for all its history, so can you explain how you got involved and the changes you have already made and what you plan to do going forward?

 Q3: Medicare has migrated from the fee for service model to a per member per month paradigm. What would motivate a primary care provider to work with you and do you have any role when the primary care doc tells refers people to a specialist?

 Q4: The company has not been profitable in the past. Did covid have an effect on the company’s operations?

 Q5: What can investors look at to see signs that the company is moving towards profitability? Are there any specific metrics?

 Q6: As people get older, they generally need more medical care. The government stratifies Medicare enrollees into risk categories. If you can work with primary care doctors to keep patients as healthy as possible, that saves Medicare money – we can all understand that. What knowledge or processes do you bring to the table that changes the medical care of patients that the primary care doctor would not have without you?

 Q7: Are there trends in your physician retention rate? Have they changed since you came on board?

 Q8: Any changes to your business plan with a new administration in the white house?

 Q9: People find it hard, sometimes almost impossible to find good primary care physicians. Some of this is from what is referred to as physician burnout, leading to a doctor shortage. That is alarming given the “ageing” of our population. Is there any role for P3 in addressing this issue?

 Q10: P3 is an “under the radar company”. If investors are looking at enrollment growth, revenues per full time employee, or something else…what should we focus on that will give us a “heads up” that you would be breaking into profitability?

 

 P3 is a patient-centered and physician-led population health management company. Founded and led by physicians, P3 is a team of doctors, clinicians and support service professionals with a shared passion for delivering value-based care. We leverage our deeply integrated and capital efficient care model, data and technology, physician leadership and community outreach tools to create enhanced patient outcomes and experiences, greater satisfaction for providers and caregivers and lower care costs.
