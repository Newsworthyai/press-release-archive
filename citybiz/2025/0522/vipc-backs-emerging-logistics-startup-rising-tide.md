# VIPC Backs Emerging Logistics Startup Rising Tide

The Virginia Innovation Partnership Corp., the nonprofit operations arm of the state-run Virginia Innovation Partnership Authority, has announced a strategic investment in Rising Tide, a Richmond, Va.-based SaaS startup using AI and intelligent automation to streamline last-mile delivery and home services logistics. VIPC said the investment was made through its venture capital program, Virginia Venture Partners (VVP), and was part of the company’s $1.2 million seed round.

 “VIPC’s investment in Rising Tide aligns with our commitment to fostering technology that strengthens Virginia’s innovation economy,” said VIPC President and CEO Joe Benevento. “Rising Tide offers a unique solution that solves a shared pain point in the complex logistics and supply chain industry. We are thrilled to see this innovation emerge from the Richmond, Virginia startup ecosystem.”

It is building a platform that intelligently automates dispatch, routing and administrative tasks, replacing outdated batch systems.

 “We built Rising Tide to solve the systemic inefficiencies plaguing logistics,” said Rising Tide founder and CEO Jeff Corbett, who previously ran T.W. Franchise Holdings “With support from VIPC, we’re accelerating our ability to get this dynamic technology into the hands of route owners, franchise leaders, and home services businesses who need better tools to compete and thrive.”

 Rising Tide’s “technology addresses a massive and underserved market, and their ability to deliver real operational improvements and cost savings is already clear. This is the kind of technology innovation we strive to support at VIPC,” said Jennifer O’Daniel, senior investment director for VIPC’s venture capital program VVP.

 Since its inception in 2004, VVP has invested in more than 300 startups and attracted more than $2 billion of private industry capital into Virginia.
