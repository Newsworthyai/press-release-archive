# Raskin Raises, Banks Millions, Far Outstripping Other Maryland Delegation Members

With more than a year to the next elections, members of Maryland’s congressional delegation and their would-be challengers had raised $6.2 million this year and already put almost $12 million aside — with nearly half of both amounts attributable to Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th).

 Raskin raised more than $2.5 million in the first six months of the year, according to the latest campaign finance reports from the Federal Election Commission, four times the amount raised by the second most-prolific fundraiser in the state, Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), who brought in $609,303.

 And Raskin had nearly $5.9 million in cash on hand as of June 30, more than 2.5 times Sen. Chris Van Hollen’s (D-Md.) $2.2 million.

 Raskin was the 20th-biggest fundraiser of the 919 House incumbents and challengers who reported raising any money this year, according to the FEC. A high-profile and vocal critic of President Donald Trump (R), he received donations from 44 states, although the largest share was from Maryland.
