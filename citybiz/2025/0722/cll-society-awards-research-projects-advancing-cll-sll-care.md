# CLL Society Awards Research Projects Advancing CLL/SLL Care

SAN DIEGO, July 21, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — CLL Society, the world’s leading authority for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma patients, has announced the recipients of its 2025 Research Program awards. This year, three outstanding researchers have been honored across key categories including the Integrative Medicine Award, Clinical Scholar Award and Young Investigator Award.

 CLL Society is committed to transforming the lives of patients through groundbreaking research, advocacy, and support. Its Research Program funds novel projects that aim to improve outcomes and quality of life for those living with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). The 2025 recipients reflect bold innovation across clinical, scientific, and integrative approaches.

 The 2025 Research Program recipients are as follows:

 Integrative Medicine Awards: Created to support research that investigates the clinical impact or biological mechanisms of integrative medicine therapies for individuals with CLL and SLL, this year’s award honors Dr. Nancy Musoke, a Hematology/Oncology fellow at Cleveland Clinic Cancer Institute. Dr. Musoke’s project, “Curcumin, Exercise and Placebo Effects on CLL/SLL Progression and Immune Function,” explores whether non-pharmacologic interventions, specifically curcumin supplementation and increased physical activity, can improve immune health, enhance quality of life, or potentially slow disease progression for patients in the early, treatment-free “watch-and-wait” phase. The study aims to close a critical research gap surrounding integrative approaches commonly requested by patients but rarely studied in a clinical setting. This award is made possible through generous community donations and a matching grant from Vigyan Singhal.

 Clinical Scholar Award: Dedicated to supporting exceptional physician-researchers working to advance treatment for CLL/SLL, this year’s Clinical Scholar Award honors Dr. Matthew S. Davids, Director of Clinical Research in the Lymphoma Division at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. His project, “Optimizing Glofitamab Combination Therapy in Richter’s Transformation,” explores new non-chemotherapy treatment approaches for Richter’s transformation (RT), a rare and aggressive progression of CLL. The study evaluates glofitamab, an FDA-approved bispecific antibody for lymphoma, alone and in combination with other novel agents, aiming to uncover more effective and less toxic therapies. With broad eligibility criteria and cutting-edge laboratory analysis, Dr. Davids’ work seeks to personalize treatment strategies for RT and improve outcomes for patients facing one of the most difficult complications of CLL.

 Young Investigator Award: This award supports early-career researchers with a focus on breakthrough science that can improve the understanding and treatment of CLL/SLL. Dr. Quinlan Sievers, a medical oncology fellow at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, is recognized for his research project, “Discovery and Overcoming Mechanisms of Resistance to BTK Inhibitors.” With BTK degraders emerging as a promising new class of therapy for CLL/SLL, Dr. Sievers’ study investigates how and why resistance to these treatments develops. Using genetic sequencing and laboratory models, the project aims to identify resistance pathways and inform the next generation of BTK-targeted therapies. Dr. Sievers’ research has the potential to guide more durable and personalized treatment options for patients who relapse after current BTK-directed therapies.

 “Since launching in 2022, our Research Program has grown significantly, expanding from a single award to multiple annual grants that target critical gaps in CLL/SLL care,” said Robyn Brumble, Senior Director of Scientific Affairs at CLL Society. “This year’s awardees represent the cutting edge of clinical care, scientific discovery and integrative approaches.”

 The CLL Society’s Research Program is made possible by individual contributions. For more information on the research that CLL Society is funding, please visit cllsociety.org/what-we-fund/.
