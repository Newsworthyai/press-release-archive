# Vital Impulses: CHROMA 2025 Readies Its Boldest Miami Art Week Showcase Yet

As the international art world turns its gaze toward Miami for December’s Art Basel Miami Beach and Miami Art Week, Lucid Design District is proud to announce the return of its acclaimed group exhibition: CHROMA 2025 – Vital Impulses in Contemporary Art. This fourth edition of CHROMA will take place from December 3–17, 2025, with the Opening Reception set for Wednesday, December 3, from 4:00–7:00 PM. The Opening Reception is FREE with RSVP. 10 NE 41st Street, Miami, FL 33137.

 This year’s exhibition will unfold inside Lucid Design District’s expansive 3,700-square-foot gallery, one of the largest independently owned venues in the Miami Design District, a neighborhood globally renowned for its luxury fashion houses, fine dining, museums, and large-scale public installations.

 CHROMA 2025 features a compelling mix of 22 artists—8 returning and 14 new—representing regions as far-reaching as Australia, Argentina, Canada, Ecuador, and Venezuela, in addition to the United States. This year’s curatorial theme, Vital Impulses in Contemporary Art, explores the instinctual drive behind artistic creation and the power of bold expression across mediums such as painting, sculpture, ceramics, functional design, murals, and kinetic art.

 “I believe that art matters,” comments Payal Tak, owner of Lucid Design District. “It is a conduit through which an artist’s energies flow to the viewer and open up our minds and hearts, allowing for new ways for us to see everything around us, including ourselves. At Lucid, creativity is always in progress. I welcome art lovers to experience this year’s exhibition, and soak in the imaginations of the exhibiting artists.”

 “This year’s selected artists create and present works that express authentic expressions of what moves, transforms, and intensifies existence,” adds Graciela Montich, curator of CHROMA and participating artist. “We have sought works that provoke reflection, awaken an emotional, intellectual, and a sensory reaction in the audience.”

 Live mural performance and entertainment details to be announced in September. Inquire about sponsorship opportunities.

 FREE with RSVP to the Opening Reception: Email info@luciddesigndistrict.com. Passes will also be available soon on Eventbrite.

 General exhibition hours will be open for walk-in visits; dates and times to be announced.

 About Lucid Design District

 Founded by Payal Tak in 2021 and located at 10 NE 41st Street, Lucid Design District debuted as a gallery during Art Basel 2022. The space has since become a cornerstone of the Miami Design District’s art scene. Featuring 8 solo-curio spaces, an expansive reception gallery, and an outdoor installation wall, Lucid is dedicated to showcasing bold voices across all career stages. CHROMA continues to be its flagship exhibition during Miami Art Week.

 “After retiring from a high intensity career in technology five years ago I traded corporate America for an art gallery,” comments Payal Tak. “My mission was simple – to make available an easily accessible wall space for artists in a prime location. CHROMA continues to attract thousands of visitors during Art Week and Lucid continues to showcase the artists’ creations well into the following year, making it a very desirable platform for the artists to participate in and for art lovers to discover the undiscovered.”
