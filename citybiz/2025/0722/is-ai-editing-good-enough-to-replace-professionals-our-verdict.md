However, when it comes to conveying complex stories or projects where emotional pacing, cinematic detail, and brand tone are the top priorities, human editors still work the best. Why? This is simply because AI can identify patterns, but it lacks emotional responses. It can’t scan a room, grasp subtlety, or make decisions based on taste like a good creative can.
