# Kwikset Debuts Brentford™ Handleset in Signature Series™ Collection

Kwikset®, a trusted leader in residential security and a registered trademark of ASSA ABLOY Americas Residential Inc., an ASSA ABLOY Group Company, has introduced Brentford, a new front door handleset that pairs transitional design with reliable durability and security.

 With its graceful curves and clean lines, Brentford delivers a look that complements both modern and classic exteriors. Designed for maximum versatility, Brentford is available in keyed and dummy functions, making it an ideal finishing touch for single or double front doors. It pairs seamlessly with a range of Kwikset interior knobs and levers, including Sora, Trafford and Sedona, and is available in Matte Black and Satin Nickel finishes. Both finishes feature Microban® antimicrobial protection, which keeps surfaces 99.9% cleaner than unprotected hardware — an added benefit for high-touch entryways.

 Like all products in the Kwikset Signature Series, Brentford is engineered for performance and reliability. Each keyed handleset features Kwikset’s SmartKey Security®, which is bump- and pick-resistant and allows homeowners to re-key the lock themselves in seconds. As the inventors of SmartKey Security, Kwikset continues to lead the industry in advanced DIY re-key technology, helping homeowners maintain control and peace of mind without calling in a professional.

 Brentford is certified Grade AAA by the Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association (BHMA) for security, durability and finish, ensuring it meets the highest performance standards. Each handleset includes a fully adjustable throughbolt to accommodate a wide variety of existing door preps and easily installs with just a screwdriver.

 “Brentford is transitional by nature — clean and elegant, yet adaptable to nearly any style of home,” said Amanda Archer, group manager of product marketing at Kwikset. “It’s designed to deliver on both form and function, all while offering the security of SmartKey re-key technology.”

 Beginning at $112.99, Brentford is available now through Kwikset’s professional distribution partners and is rolling out to major retailers and online platforms.
