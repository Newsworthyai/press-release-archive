# Rising Phoenix Royalties Closes Tactical DJ Basin Divestiture in Weld County

Rising Phoenix Royalties, a privately held mineral and royalty acquisition firm, announced the closing of a strategic divestiture in Weld County, Colorado, at the heart of the DJ Basin. The deal highlights the firm’s real-time operational model and ability to act quickly on drilling and development signals.

 The asset, located under PDC Energy-operated acreage (now part of Chevron), was originally acquired after Rising Phoenix identified five (5) drilled but uncompleted wells (“DUCs”) that had been sitting idle for over 18 months. Once a frack crew was confirmed on location, the firm moved quickly to negotiate and close on the asset.

 “This was a classic Rising Phoenix deal,” said Jace Graham, CEO and Founder. “We saw DUCs, verified field activity, and moved fast to secure the acreage. Part of the position was allocated to our Maroon Bells Fund, and we immediately monetized the balance by reselling to a group of institutional buyers. That’s our model: move with conviction, maximize value, and stay flexible on how we deploy and return capital.”

 The transaction was executed through Rising Phoenix’s RP Royalties platform, which focuses on basin-specific execution and repositioning underdeveloped mineral assets with near-term catalysts.

“Our team knows this basin cold,” said Adam Lapucha, VP of Engineering. “This wasn’t luck. We knew the wells, understood the risk, and acted fast when the timing was right.”

 This deal builds on a string of recent successes in the DJ Basin, where Rising Phoenix Royalties continues to leverage its ground game strategy—a combination of boots-on-the-ground brokers, local intelligence, and technical underwriting—to source high-quality minerals before they hit the broader market.

 The firm remains active in the DJ, Permian, and Mid-Con basins and is currently pursuing both producing and undeveloped assets where clear operator signals align with internal risk models.
