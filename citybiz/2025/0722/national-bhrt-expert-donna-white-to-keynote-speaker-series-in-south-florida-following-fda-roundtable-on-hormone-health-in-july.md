# National BHRT Expert Donna White to Keynote Speaker Series in South Florida Following FDA Roundtable on Hormone Health in July

On the heels of the FDA’s highly anticipated July 17th Roundtable on Hormone Therapy, one of the nation’s most recognized voices in hormone health will take center stage in South Florida. Donna White, Founder of the BHRT Training Academy and International bestselling author of The Hormone Makeover, will headline the Million Dollar Message: The Future is Now — AI & Wellness event at the Boca Raton Innovation Campus on August 29.

 As the conversation around women’s health and hormone therapy continues to escalate on a national level, Donna White’s keynote couldn’t be more timely—or more vital. With more than 30 years of expertise and an unwavering commitment to education, advocacy, and transformation, Donna is widely considered one of the leading pioneers in the bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT) space.

 “Women have been misled for far too long,” says White. “The FDA roundtable signals an important shift—but now it’s time to take the truth mainstream. That’s what The Hormone Revolution is all about.”

 While the Million Dollar Message event explores cutting-edge innovations like artificial intelligence and how it’s reshaping industries, Donna’s presence ensures that the most personal aspect of health—hormones—gets the spotlight it deserves. She’s on a mission to empower both patients and practitioners with clear, evidence-based information and to break down the barriers of misinformation that have plagued hormone health for decades.

 White’s message is rooted not just in science, but in story. Her own experience with hormonal imbalance led her to seek answers, challenge outdated medical narratives, and ultimately build a training academy that has educated hundreds of medical providers across the country. Her message at Million Dollar Message promises to offer both professional insight and heartfelt motivation.

 Attendees can expect to hear firsthand about:

 * The real implications of the WHI study that derailed hormone therapy for a generation
* The critical difference between synthetic and bioidentical hormones
* The latest research and how it can be applied in real-life clinical and personal settings
* How wellness entrepreneurs and practitioners can lead the charge in reshaping healthcare from the inside out

 White will be joined by other powerhouse keynote speakers, including bestselling author and leadership expert Heather Monahan and international AI strategist Phil Stringer. Together, the trio represents a powerful trifecta of wellness, tech, and personal growth.

 Held at the iconic Boca Raton Innovation Campus, the event is expected to attract a vibrant mix of entrepreneurs, TEDx speakers, tech founders, wellness professionals, and high-impact influencers. With both General Admission and VIP tickets available, attendees can choose their level of access, with VIP perks including priority seating, speaker meet-and-greets, and premium networking.

 And for those eager to dive in before the event, Donna White recently launched The Bioidentical Hormone Revolution—a no-strings-attached, downloadable eBook that’s already making waves. It’s a powerful, myth-busting guide designed to inform and inspire anyone ready to understand their hormones and take charge of their health.
