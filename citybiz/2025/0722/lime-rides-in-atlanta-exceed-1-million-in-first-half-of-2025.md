# Lime Rides in Atlanta Exceed 1 Million in First Half of 2025

* Ridership grows 45% from 2024
* Atlantans took 205,348 rides in June alone
* Lime continues to invest in Atlanta, including deploying new Gen LimeBikes and Lime Glider, Pride initiatives and community events

 In the first half of 2025, Lime riders have taken over 1 million trips, an increase of 45% compared to the same period last year. June alone saw 205,348 trips, marking 18% growth year over year. Even in the heat of the Georgia summer, Atlantans are enthusiastic about micromobility.

 “The remarkable growth we’ve seen in Atlanta, now hitting one million rides in the first half of 2025, showcases how deeply integrated Lime has become into the fabric of daily life here,” said Carol Antunez, Senior Manager of Government Relations at Lime. This success directly fuels our continued investment in the city, from supporting community initiatives like our Pride campaign to launching new, inclusive options like LimeBike and Glider, and offering essential rider education through First Ride Academies. We’re proud to provide an affordable, accessible, and enjoyable way for Atlanta, contributing to a more connected and greener future.”

 Pride in Atlanta

 

 As part of its broader commitment to supporting communities of all backgrounds and identities, Lime celebrated Pride Month in Atlanta through its global ‘Ride Forward’ campaign. As part of this initiative, Lime provided financial support and amplified the mission of Out Front Theatre, Atlanta’s only theater solely dedicated to LGBTQIA+ voices. To promote visibility and celebration across the city, a selection of Lime’s e-scooters and e-bikes were wrapped in Pride flag colors.

 “We are beyond ecstatic to partner with Lime for pride to help bring awareness to the work that we do at Out Front Theatre Company to center and highlight LGBTQIA+ stories on stage. Our community’s stories are the foundation that supports our continued push for understanding and empathy, and it is heartwarming that a company like Lime is willing to stand shoulder to shoulder with us. I hope everyone takes advantage of these fabulous Lime scooters in June and makes their way to the theater for some joyful shows to celebrate Pride month!” said Paul Conroy, Founder & Producing Artistic Director at Out Front Theatre.

 On June 1, Lime partnered with Schaf Shop, a queer-owned coffee shop, for a vibrant community event offering complimentary drinks and sweet treats. This celebration underscores Lime’s ongoing commitment to uplifting LGBTQIA+ small businesses and fostering safe, welcoming spaces for the Lime community to connect. By spotlighting local queer-owned establishments, Lime continues to invest in inclusive partnerships that elevate underrepresented voices and strengthen community bonds.

 Lime Continues to Invest in Atlanta

 In May, Atlanta became the first city in the U.S. to officially launch LimeBike, Lime’s newest and most inclusive model of e-bike. Designed to make micromobility more accessible for women, older riders, and commuters, the LimeBike was a natural fit for Atlanta’s growing and diverse rider base. Now, with a small fleet of LimeGliders, Atlanta is the only city in the US to have both of Lime’s latest models of vehicles.

 Further expanding accessibility, Lime recently announced a new partnership with the Atlanta Beltline Partnership to launch no-cost First Ride Academies (FRAs). The first session took place last Saturday, June 21. These monthly classes, held directly on the Atlanta Beltline, are designed to help riders become familiar and comfortable with Lime’s e-bikes.

 Offered twice per month through the winter, these free and public FRAs provide hands-on instruction in e-bike handling, safe riding techniques, local regulations, and best practices for navigating city streets and trails. As an added bonus, all attendees receive a helmet from Lime at no cost.

 

 Lime recently announced that it has achieved an astonishing 66.8% reduction in company-wide carbon emissions intensity in 2024 from its 2019 baseline, keeping it on track for net-zero by 2030. This accomplishment is driven by comprehensive efforts across shipping logistics, powering all facilities and fleets with 100% renewable energy, reducing parts-associated emissions through durability and recycling, and pioneering second-life motor innovations with new partners.

 Lime’s consistent success in Atlanta and other cities stems from its ability to combine global expertise with a hyperlocal approach. This means hiring local staff and working collaboratively with city officials and communities to develop micromobility programs tailored to each neighborhood’s unique needs. The company’s financial stability also enables long-term investment in cities, delivering reliable, sustainable service for riders and non-riders alike, contributing to a greener and more connected urban environment.
