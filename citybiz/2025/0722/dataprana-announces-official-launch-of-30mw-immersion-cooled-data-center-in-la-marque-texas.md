# Dataprana Announces Official Launch of 30MW Immersion-Cooled Data Center in La Marque, Texas

Dataprana, Inc., a US-based data center developer and operator focused on high-performance, energy-intensive infrastructure for digital asset mining and AI workloads, has officially launched its flagship 30MW immersion-cooled data center in La Marque, Texas.

 The facility became fully operational in early June, supporting next-generation mining operations in a modular setup with 30 state-of-the-art immersion mining containers by leading manufacturers Intelliflex and Arctic Systems.

 Initial deployment saw the connection of 1,280 Whatsminer M66S units across 10 Intelliflex pods, delivering a high-density, immersion-cooled environment optimized for performance and efficiency. The La Marque facility accepts the latest immersion ASICs from Bitmain, Whatsminer, and Canaan, with a total capacity exceeding 5,000 units.

Initial hardware deployment saw a collaborative effort between Dataprana and Intelliflex, with both parties providing on-site and remote engineering and technical support. The facility includes an on-site operations center, around-the-clock monitoring, and advanced physical and cyber security measures to ensure uptime and performance integrity.

 This launch marks the completion of a flagship greenfield development project which commenced in late 2024, and a key milestone for Dataprana’s newly expanded infrastructure division. From land and power acquisition to design, permitting, and construction management, the project highlights the company’s end-to-end execution capabilities in building large-scale, load-intensive digital infrastructure in strategic US locations, such as Texas.

 “The completion of the La Marque project is not only a significant milestone for Dataprana, it’s a blueprint for what’s to come. This facility embodies our expertise in delivering reliable, future-ready data center solutions from the ground up. We’re proud to set a new standard for digital asset mining in the United States and look forward to developing several similar projects in the near future.”

 — Arseniy Grusha, CEO and Co-Founder of Dataprana
