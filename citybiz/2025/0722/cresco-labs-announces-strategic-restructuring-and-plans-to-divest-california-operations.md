# Cresco Labs Announces Strategic Restructuring and Plans to Divest California Operations

CHICAGO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Cresco Labs, today announced a strategic restructuring that includes plans to sell its California operations. This restructuring is part of the Company’s broader strategy to strengthen its balance sheet, increase cash flow, and prioritize markets with the highest margins and long-term growth potential.

 The Company is in active discussions with prospective buyers interested in acquiring its California assets, including cultivation, manufacturing, and select distribution operations. It expects to finalize the transaction within the next several quarters, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. Cresco Labs will retain full ownership of its premium FloraCal® brand and continue producing and marketing the brand across key U.S. markets.

 “Capital is increasingly precious in this environment, and our focus is on deploying it where it earns the strongest return,” said Charlie Bachtell, CEO and Co-founder of Cresco Labs. “While California is the largest cannabis market in the world, the structural challenges—ranging from fragmented retail to price compression and the illicit market—combined with our lack of scaled footprint in the state, make it extremely difficult to generate sustainable profitability. Exiting California allows us to reallocate capital and resources to our core markets and build out new markets where we see clear pathways for growth and shareholder value.”
