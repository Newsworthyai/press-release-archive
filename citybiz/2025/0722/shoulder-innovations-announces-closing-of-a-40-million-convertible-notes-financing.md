# Shoulder Innovations Announces Closing of a $40 Million Convertible Notes Financing

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., July 21, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Shoulder Innovations, a medical technology company exclusively focused on transforming the shoulder surgical care market, today announced the closing of a $40 million convertible notes financing by new investor Fidelity Management & Research Company.

 Proceeds from the financing will be used primarily to support continued commercialization of Shoulder Innovations’ advanced implant systems for anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA) and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA), as well as for new product development.

 Shoulder Innovations’ InSet Glenoid technology serves as the foundation for the company’s aTSA and rTSA implant systems and includes a novel biomechanical design that aims to reduce stress at the bone implant interface, improve fixation mechanics, enhance stability, and reduce micromotion to specifically address glenoid loosening, a primary problem in shoulder arthroplasty. Both implant systems leverage consistent surgical techniques and the same efficient, two tray instrumentation system.

 “Shoulder Innovations is transforming shoulder surgical care with a purpose-built ecosystem, designed to deliver predictable outcomes and procedural efficiency across all sites of care,” said Rob Ball, CEO of Shoulder Innovations. “We appreciate the support with this investment and believe these proceeds will help us to advance our mission to redefine shoulder arthroplasty and enable best-in-class outcomes for shoulder specialists and their patients.”
