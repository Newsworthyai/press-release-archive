# Free Fun Saturdays at The Schmidt Boca Raton History Museum

The Schmidt Boca Raton History Museum invites families to enjoy Free Fun Saturdays this fall. On the first Saturday of each month, through December, the museum offers free admission from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., plus a special hands-on children’s craft activity at 2 p.m.

 “Free Fun Saturdays are one of our favorite ways to engage children and families,” said Mary Csar, Executive Director of the Boca Raton Historical Society. “Each month kids have the chance to explore Boca Raton’s unique history and then get creative with a themed project they can take home.”

 Upcoming Free Fun Saturdays & Craft Activities

 * October 4, 2025 – Design a Welcome Sign If you could dream up a large sign to welcome visitors to Boca Raton, what would it look like? We’ll take inspiration from the historic Sanborn Square sign.
* November 1, 2025 – Fashion Design Learn about 1920s style and then design your own fashion look from the era.
* December 6, 2025 – Annual Holiday Greeting Cards Create festive cards with simple pop-up techniques and more—perfect to share with family and friends.

 Admission: FREE for all visitors (regular admission is $12 for adults, $8 for students and seniors, free for members and children 4 & under).

 Looking Ahead to 2026

 Free Fun Saturdays continue in the new year with even more creative activities:

 * January 3, 2026 – Boca Pioneers Discover the stories of early Boca residents like Imogen, who lived among swamps and mosquitos—and even kept raccoons and alligators as pets! Then make your own animal “stuffie.”
* February 7, 2026 – Valentine’s Day Cards Create a heartfelt handmade card for someone special.
