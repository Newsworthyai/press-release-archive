# Q&amp;A with Joanne DiGennaro, President of the Center for Excellence in Education

Joann DiGennaro co-founded the Center for Excellence in Education (CEE) in 1983 with Admiral H.G. Rickover, “Father of the Nuclear Navy” and a strong advocate for STEM. As president of CEE for more than four decades, she has helped thousands of students gain admission to top U.S. colleges and universities, such as Harvard, Princeton, MIT, and Cal-Tech. CEE alumni have gone on to become executives at top companies, such as BCG, CISCO, Citadel Securities. The Defense Department, Genentech, Google, Meta (Facebook), McKinsey & Company, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Open AI, Pinterest, SpaceX, and Tesla.

 Few knew Admiral Rickover as I did. He is the hero of his own “Horatio Alger story.”

 Joann has served on several university boards, including as chair of the U.S. Army War College Board of Visitors, to which she was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2005. She was also appointed to the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, where she served a five-year term, and the Commission on Higher Education Reform, Innovation, and Investment. Joann received her Bachelor of Science at Purdue University and her Master of Science at the University of Maryland. She studied law at Oxford University and received her Juris Doctor at George Mason University.

 Tell us about CEE. What is the organization’s mission?

 The Center for Excellence in Education (CEE) is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) organization that nurtures high school and university scholars to careers of excellence and leadership in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and encourages collaboration between and among scientific and technological leaders in the global community.

 Over the years, we have become a source of STEM talent for prestigious universities, such as Harvard, MIT, Cal-Tech, Princeton, Stanford, UCLA, and Yale, to name a few. Other alumni have gone on to shining careers at leading technology, financial services, and pharmaceutical and biotech corporations. CEE has proven itself to be a go-to source for STEM talent.

 How did you come to establish the Center for Excellence in Education (CEE) with Admiral H.G. Rickover? What was it like to work with him?

 Admiral H.G. Rickover was the longest-serving officer in the history of the U.S. Navy. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1922, served in World War II, and was known as the “Father of the Nuclear Navy” for developing the world’s first nuclear-powered submarine. He was a Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient, the first person honored with two Congressional Gold Medals, and he served under every U.S. president from Warren Harding to Ronald Reagan, including Jimmy Carter, whom Rickover had selected for the nuclear program.

 The admiral believed the American education system was failing current and future generations. He believed that nurturing careers of excellence and leadership in science and technology in young scholars was an essential investment for America and its future as a global leader. The admiral and I met with educators around the world to create a unique educational experience for high-achieving STEM students. The result was the Research Science Institute (RSI), a six-week research program collaboratively sponsored with MIT that launched in 1984. His legacy lives on at CEE today.

 Why is an organization like yours needed so much?

 * STEM education is considered crucial for the future of the United States. Educating more people in these disciplines also increases the probability of finding solutions to global challenges: disease, energy, environment, and technology issues.
* STEM subjects emphasize inquiry, evidence, and logical reasoning. Students learn how to analyze complex problems, test solutions, and adapt—skills that transfer to any career or life challenge. Additionally, STEM fields fuel nearly every major innovation, from medical breakthroughs to artificial intelligence to climate solutions. Many of the fastest-growing and best-paying careers (software development, data science, fintech, clean energy engineering, biotech, cybersecurity, etc.) in today’s economy require strong STEM skills. Countries with a strong STEM workforce are more competitive in global markets and better equipped to drive innovation. That’s why our mission is so important.
* STEM careers help underrepresented groups, including women, minorities, and first-generation students pursue high paying jobs that enable economic advancement. In short, STEM education equips individuals with the skills for modern jobs, boosts innovation, and prepares society to tackle urgent challenges while expanding opportunity.

 What types of companies hire CEE graduates?

 CEE alumni have gone on to shining careers at companies like Apple, BCG, Cisco, Citadel Securities, Goldman Sachs, Google, Meta (Facebook), McKinsey & Co., Microsoft, NVIDIA, OpenAI, Oracle, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, SpaceX, and the U.S. Department of Defense.

 Who are some of CEE’s most successful alumni?

 We are particularly proud of our alumni of the RSI program at MIT. They include:

 * Diane Tang (RSI ’90), a Google Fellow with expertise in large-scale data analysis and infrastructure;
* Dr. Lauren Ancel Meyers (RSI 1990), a pioneer in the field of network epidemiology and the application of machine learning to improve outbreak detection, forecasting and control;
* Aaron Kesselheim (RSI ’91), Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School who leads an academic research center that focuses on pharmaceutical policy and evidence-based use of medicines;
* Ben Silbermann (RSI ’98), co-founder & CEO of Pinterest; and
* Feng Zhang, PhD (RSI ’99), a pioneer of the revolutionary CRISPR gene-editing technology.

 CEE recently hosted its annual Research Science Institute (RSI), the organization’s flagship program at MIT. What do the students take away from this program?

 I am proud and realize how worthwhile our work is. CEE alumni remain very connected with us. Whenever they win an award, they give credit to their experience at our RSI program.

 Who supports your organization?

 Many firms in STEM-related fields support CEE, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, technology companies, financial corporations, and foundations, including Akamai Technologies, Citadel Securities, Jane Street Capital, Lockheed Martin, Regeneron, and TC Energy Foundation, among others. We welcome other funders to support us, especially since CEE is a go-to place for corporations to find STEM talent.

 Looking back at your life’s work, did you ever expect to still be part of the organization 43 years later? What are your proudest accomplishments as president of CEE?

 I did not plan a career in education. My goal was to own the property that Bergdorf sits on and to become a real estate giant! Admiral Rickover presented me with an opportunity that I could not refuse. CEE has had three U.S. presidents on the Board and a U.S. Navy hero who was so historically significant. There are challenges, but I’ve never thought about doing anything else. I love what I do, and the success that it brings to our students. And I love my country and know that we need these students to research, invent, and achieve.

 I understand that I have written a biography of Admiral Rickover. What motivated you to author this book? What can you tell us about it?

 Few knew Admiral Rickover as I did. He is the hero of his own “Horatio Alger story.” He had a lot of challenges but ultimately became one of this nation’s brilliant engineers. He helped make this country No. 1 in defense.

 People need to know the real Rickover. His critics said he was mean and not a true engineer. I thought the truth needed to be told, and that’s why I wrote the book. Admiral Rickover was among the most read people in the humanities. He loved poetry, history, and other subjects. There is no great scientist who is not well-versed in the humanities. He had a dry sense of humor that didn’t come across to everybody. He could be hilarious.

 I hope the book can inspire people to do more, to go beyond their little cocoons. The admiral is a splendid example of someone who did that.

 How can people learn more about CEE, and what do you want them to know most?

 There are so many opportunities. Our volunteers and those involved are our lifeblood. They are guest speakers, they mentor underrepresented students and teachers and enrich STEM development, and they help students with their trajectory to have a successful career in STEM. Of course, any donations are appreciated. Contact us by visiting CEE.org, by phone at (703) 448-9062, or by mail: Center for Excellence in Education, 7918 Jones Branch Drive, Suite 700, McLean, VA 22102.
