# Lantern Hill’s Popular Two-Bedroom Residence is Perfect for Hosting Family

By Gregory J. Alexander

 When planning their move to Lantern Hill, the Erickson Senior Living community in New Providence, N.J., Bill and Betty Shapiro wanted to make sure the home they chose would work well for family gatherings and other get-togethers. The Garfield, a large two-bedroom, two-bath floor plan with a den and screened-in porch, fit the bill perfectly.

 Since they moved in, the couple have enjoyed hosting frequent visits with their children and grandchildren, as well as game nights and holiday dinners.

 “The Garfield has a large living room with lots of open space, which is perfect for the grandkids to play in. There are two bathrooms, and one has a bathtub. When we first visited and I saw the bathtub, I was so excited, as I knew it would be perfect for the children to enjoy bubble baths,” says Betty.

 “It’s a spacious floor plan, and I like how the two bedrooms are on opposite sides of the apartment, which is perfect when we have overnight guests,” notes Bill.

 The couple also enjoys the outdoor space that their balcony provides. “It’s such a beautiful view,” says Betty. “We both believe that it’s very important to be outside and see nature and green space.”

 Cooking in or dining out The Shapiros have found that the large, open kitchen is the perfect place for making meals.

 “When we have family visiting, especially for Thanksgiving, we like to cook together here,” says Betty. “We are all part of a delightful dance of happy, moving culinary parts.”

 It also works well when it’s just the two of them. “We also like to prepare our own breakfast and lunch here in the apartment, which is convenient,” adds Bill. “I also like how the Garfield has a designated dining area. We were able to bring the dining room table from our home.”

 Array of options Betty notes that they also love the convenience and quality of Lantern Hill’s restaurants. “I’m totally spoiled,” she laughs. “It’s so nice to simply go downstairs in the elevator and have a great meal where I do not have to cook.”

 Bill agrees. “It was not hard to give up cooking every night. I like the food here and eating in the restaurants is also a great way to engage with friends. Everyone is so welcoming and friendly, and the community is filled with such wonderful people. Moving to Lantern Hill was such an easy experience for us.”

 An active, social lifestyle Bill and Betty also enjoy Lantern Hill’s numerous opportunities for social engagement. Betty volunteers on the dining committee, cochairs the writing group, and attends a variety of lectures and workshops. She also participates in boxing, Qigong, art classes, and table tennis.

 Bill volunteers his time on the Resident Advisory Council, chairs the Health, Safety, and Security Committee, and plays pickleball and bocce. Together, the couple enjoys line dancing and leading a healing service.

 “Both line dancing and pickleball are great exercise, as well as provide a social opportunity to make new friends,” says Bill. “Between all of the activities and eating in the restaurants, it’s easy to stay busy and have an active social life.”

 “However, when you want privacy or maybe just want to sit outside and read a good book, you can do that too,” adds Betty.

 Close to family Bill and Betty were living in suburban Philadelphia when they decided that they wanted to move to a retirement community.

 “My father-in-law lived in a continuing care retirement community for many years, and he was very happy,” Bill says. Initially, the couple looked at Ann’s Choice, an Erickson Senior Living community in Bucks County, Pa.

 “We liked Ann’s Choice very much, and it was located close to where we lived, where our friends were, and where we had established doctors,” says Bill. “We talked about it, and decided that we wanted to be closer to our family. We went to the Erickson website and saw that Lantern Hill was very close to our family. It seemed like the logical choice.”

 “Being close to our family ultimately was the most important factor,” concurs Betty. “Since moving to Lantern Hill in August 2022, our son and daughter-in-law have had a second child, and our younger son and his partner have moved to the area,” says Bill. Betty adds, “We are delighted. It’s great being close to family and be able to easily see one another.”
