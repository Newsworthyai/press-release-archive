 MBK Rental Living, a preeminent lifestyle developer of apartment communities that has operated solely in California for more than a decade, announced that it has opened its first two luxury apartment communities in Colorado. Alexan Peña Station, located in Northeast Denver, was developed with joint venture partners Trammell Crow Residential and Tokyo Tatemono, and The Aven in Colorado Springs is in collaboration with Hines.

 “After much anticipation, we are pleased to open the doors of our two newest luxury apartment communities and usher in a new era of development in Colorado with the support of our JV partners,” said Ken McCarren, President of MBK Rental Living “This strategic expansion signals our growth to become a luxury developer in the Western U.S., with a keen focus on building communities that enrich the lives of residents and provide significant returns for partners and investors.”

 Alexan Peña Station in Northeast Denver features 578 units ranging from 686 to 1,350 square feet, with one-, two- and three-bedroom floor plans. The 20-acre site has a total of 14 three- and four-story buildings and a host of community amenities including two resort-style pools with sun shelves and cabanas, two clubhouses, co-working offices, community garden plots, and a beer garden with outdoor games. Developed with JV partners Trammell Crow Residential and Tokyo Tatemono, the community is centered around a two-acre public park that features large and small dog parks, a pickleball court, and a multi-use trail.

 Located in Northeast Denver, Alexan Peña Station is surrounded by urban conveniences and recreation spanning entertainment, shopping, dining, transportation, business, schools, and parks. Residents will enjoy walkability to popular destinations and neighborhood gatherings in and around the community, and convenient access to public transportation options for Denver International Airport and regional draws including the Denver Zoo and Dicks Sporting Goods Park.

 The Aven in Colorado Springs includes 284 units ranging from 606 to 1,429 square feet, with one-, two- and three-bedroom floor plans. Situated on 9.7 acres and developed with JV partner Hines, the three- and four-story buildings offer unobstructed mountain views and numerous amenities including a clubhouse with a resort-style pool, contemporary co-working spaces, a fitness center and dog park.

 Set in the heart of Briargate, one of Colorado Springs’ most desirable neighborhoods, The Aven offers a perfect blend of scenic living and everyday convenience. Its prime location provides residents with access to premier shopping, top-rated schools, and beautiful outdoor amenities including parks, bike lanes, and paved trails. It is minutes away from local landmarks like Briargate’s John Venezia Community Park and The Promenade Shops, an upscale destination for dining and retail, and in close proximity to Peterson Space Force Base and the United States Air Force Academy. The Aven also offers easy access to Highway I-25, Mountain Metro Transit Route 38, and available airport shuttles to Denver International Airport.

 “Colorado is a very dynamic market and a highly desirable place to live, and we are eager to introduce our best-in-class amenities, gathering spaces and activities that are personalized for each community to enrich the lives of residents,” McCarren noted. “The teams have already started to welcome residents home to Alexan Peña Station and The Aven.”

 “Based on our leasing activity and the community interest we have seen so far, I certainly envision additional projects in the state and others in the Western U.S. to announce in the future,” added McCarren.

 In addition to its two Colorado communities, MBK Rental Living is currently leasing several communities in California including Esperanza and Solana in Duarte, Zia in Anaheim, The Haven in Petaluma, Vida in Morgan Hill. Plans are also set for three new communities to begin pre-leasing in early 2026, Vintage Farms in Murrieta, The Sanctuary in Thousand Oaks, and Las Brisas in Santa Maria.
