# NOW Insurance Ranks No. 30 In Insurance on the 2025 Inc. 5000 List

Inc. revealed today that NOW Insurance is one of the fastest growing companies in America, making the Inc. 5000 list for the second consecutive year. The company achieved the 30th spot in insurance industry rankings. The list provides a data-driven snapshot of the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Past honorees include companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Chobani, Under Armour, Timberland, Oracle, and Patagonia.

 “Making the Inc. 5000 list for the second time is a proud milestone for NOW Insurance and a testament to the hard work, innovation, and customer-first focus of our team,” said Philip Cabaud, CEO of NOW Insurance. “This recognition reflects not only our rapid growth, but also our commitment to transforming the insurance experience with modern, accessible, and transparent solutions for our clients.”

 This year’s Inc. 5000 honorees have demonstrated exceptional growth while navigating economic uncertainty, inflationary pressure, and a fluctuating labor market. Among the top 500 companies on the list, the median three-year revenue growth rate reached 1,552 percent, and those companies have collectively added more than 48,678 jobs to the U.S. economy over the past three years.

“Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” says Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm—they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”
