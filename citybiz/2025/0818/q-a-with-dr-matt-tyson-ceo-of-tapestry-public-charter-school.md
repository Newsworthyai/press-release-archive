# Q&amp;A with Dr. Matt Tyson, CEO of Tapestry Public Charter School

Dr. Matthew M. Tyson is an educational leader and researcher based in Atlanta who currently serves as Principal and CEO of Tapestry Public Charter School, an inclusive charter school with an equal population of neurotypical and special needs students.

 Dr. Tyson is a passionate advocate for educational equity and expanding access to high-quality educational programming. His goal is to create additional inclusive charter schools throughout the nation. Dr. Tyson was an early proponent of artificial intelligence in the classroom and his work on the impact of AI on educational leadership has been published in the Journal of Educational Leadership.

 While studying for his doctoral degree, he was selected to represent Georgia State University at the David L. Clark National Graduate Student Research Seminar, and he is a 2023 GSU 40 Under 40 Award Recipient. Dr. Tyson has presented at numerous education conferences across the nation and has helped his school achieve awards such as Georgia Charter School of the Year and a Building Hope Impact Award for Student Empowerment.

 Let’s start with the big picture — why do you believe public school choice is at a crossroads right now?

 We’re in a moment that will shape American education for decades. Over the past ten years, more parents have realized that their zoned school might not be the best fit for their child. They’re hungry for options that respect their child’s individuality. Unfortunately, many traditional systems see this as competition rather than an opportunity to better serve families. Too often, policy decisions are driven by fear of losing influence or funding rather than what’s best for students.

 There’s a lot of misunderstanding about charter schools. How do they differ from traditional public schools?

 First, charters are public schools: free, open to all, and funded with public dollars. But unlike traditional schools, they operate with more flexibility and can adapt to the needs of their communities. They’re also held to higher accountability standards. If a charter doesn’t meet expectations, it can be closed quickly something rarely seen in the traditional system. The irony is that the districts who authorize and evaluate charters are often the same ones that see them as a threat. Imagine asking McDonald’s if it’s okay to build a Wendy’s next door.

 Tell us about Tapestry Public Charter School and what makes it unique.

 Tapestry was founded by parents of children on the autism spectrum who wanted an authentically inclusive environment. About half of our students have special needs compared to roughly 12% in our district, yet all students learn together in a rigorous, individualized, college-prep setting. Despite this neurodiversity, our students consistently outperform peers in traditional public schools when it comes to academic growth.

 You’ve faced some significant challenges trying to replicate Tapestry’s model. What happened?

 In 2022–23, after more than a decade of success in academics and finances, we approached Atlanta Public Schools about opening a second campus in their district. We knew APS had struggled to meet the needs of diverse learners. More than 700 parents signed intent-to-enroll forms, but the board denied us unanimously, citing reasons like a “nationwide teacher shortage.” We tried again the next year, met every requirement, and were denied again.

 Did these setbacks change your strategy?

 Absolutely. We connected with families, advocates, and legislators. We weren’t alone: no district in Georgia had approved a charter in seven years. That helped fuel support for SB-82, a bipartisan bill with incentives and penalties for districts reviewing charter petitions. Then we found a committed group of parents in Clayton County who wanted more inclusive schools. We partnered with them, and in June 2025, the Clayton County Board of Education voted to authorize a second Tapestry campus, the first locally-approved charter in Georgia in seven years, and the first district-to-district replication in state history.

 That’s a huge milestone. What does it mean for the future?

 It’s proof that change is possible. Families want and deserve choice, and charters can deliver innovative, adaptive education models. Our work is just beginning but our journey shows that persistence, collaboration, and a focus on students over politics can lead to breakthroughs. Education should fit the child, not the other way around.

 Finally, what’s your message to parents and policymakers?

 Listen to families. Give schools the flexibility to innovate. Support policies that make it easier — not harder — for great models to grow. In a rapidly changing world, we can’t afford to cling to one-size-fits-all systems. Our kids deserve schools that prepare them for the future, not the past.
