# Nika Kurdiani, TBC Uzbekistan CEO, Receives Presidential Award for Contribution to Economic Development

TBC Uzbekistan, the leading digital banking ecosystem in Central Asia, announces that its CEO Nika Kurdiani has been awarded presidential honours for his contribution to Uzbekistan’s economic development.

 This prestigious recognition, awarded by President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev in honour of the country’s annual “Entrepreneur’s Day”, demonstrates TBC Uzbekistan’s continued work in raising the benchmark for financial services in the country, as well as its role in attracting increased international investment and driving economic growth.

 President Mirziyoyev also acknowledged TBC Uzbekistan’s role in supporting small and medium enterprises, a crucial part of the country’s economy. Over the past 12 months, TBC Uzbekistan has rolled out Uzbekistan’s first fully digital business banking service, adding business loans to its offering in April of this year. In June 2025, the company also announced the acquisition of BILLZ, Uzbekistan’s leading retail management SaaS platform, to further strengthen its TBC Business offering.

 Nika Kurdiani, CEO of TBC Uzbekistan, commented: “It is a great honour for me to receive this presidential award and I perceive it not as a personal achievement, but as recognition of the work and contribution of our entire team. In just five years, TBC Uzbekistan has managed to build an ecosystem that is changing the perception of financial services in the country. We are incredibly proud of what we have achieved, not just for TBC but also in terms of our contribution to Uzbekistan’s development and growth. We will continue to launch new products and implement innovative technologies to meet the highest international standards and live up to the expectations of our millions of users.”

 TBC Uzbekistan is the leading digital banking ecosystem in Central Asia with 21 million unique registered users – more than 50% of Uzbekistan’s population. It comprises a range of high-growth digital businesses: TBC UZ, the country’s largest digital bank; Payme, a digital payments app for individuals and small businesses; Payme Nasiya (Payme Instalments), a fast-growing instalment credit business, and TBC Insurance, its fully digital insurance offering.

 The digital banking ecosystem is also investing significantly into strengthening its AI capabilities, having allocated $10 million to the development of its own proprietary Speech Tech and Uzbek language LLMs. AI agents have already been rolled out across various use cases, including sales and collections, delivering significant efficiency gains. TBC Uzbekistan plans to further expand the use of AI, with its Virtual Assistant set to be launched later this year.
