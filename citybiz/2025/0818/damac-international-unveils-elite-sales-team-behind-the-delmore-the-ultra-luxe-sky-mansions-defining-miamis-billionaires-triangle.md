# DAMAC International Unveils Elite Sales Team Behind The Delmore — The Ultra-Luxe Sky Mansions Defining Miami’s “Billionaire’s Triangle”

Douglas Elliman, the project’s exclusive broker, taps top producer Tara West to lead as Director of Sales, joined on-site by Erik Schneider and Farid Moussallem

 Ryan and Max Farbstein named Ambassadors to support global high-net-worth buyer engagement

 As momentum builds around The Delmore, the ultra-luxury oceanfront condominium designed by Zaha Hadid Architects (ZHA), DAMAC International today announced the full sales team representing the landmark Surfside development. The reveal comes on the heels of a series of major construction milestones recently reached at the project site.

 Tara West, a top-producing agent with a longstanding reputation for leading South Florida’s premier residential launches, is at the helm as Director of Sales. Assembled by Douglas Elliman – The Delmore’s exclusive sales and marketing partner – the core on-site team also includes Erik Schneider and Farid Moussallem, both bringing deep experience and relationships within the ultra-luxury market.

 In addition, Ryan and Max Farbstein have been appointed as official Ambassadors, tasked with introducing the project to key high-net-worth audiences and supporting sales efforts in off-site markets around the globe.

 “This is a deeply seasoned, exceptionally respected team that brings together market insight, international reach, and a reputation for integrity,” said Jeffery Rossely, Senior Vice President of Development for DAMAC International. “We’re thrilled to have each of them represent The Delmore – a one-of-a-kind offering for both Miami and the U.S. market as a whole.”

 The announcement coincides with continued construction progress at the 8777 Collins Avenue site. In July, The Delmore secured its foundation permit from the Town of Surfside, marking a significant milepost in the build. Deep-soil mixing (DSM), led by Keller North America, has been underway for several months to reinforce the site’s perimeter, with work now more than one-third complete. To date, over $25 million has been invested in on-site construction, with vertical construction anticipated to begin in Q3 2026.

 “Timing and follow-through matter greatly in today’s market,” said Jeffery Rossely, Senior Vice President of Development for DAMAC International. “The Delmore’s progress reflects our belief that buyers deserve certainty and results – not just promises.”

 With only 37 full- and half-floor “mansions in the sky,” The Delmore is the most expensive new-build condominium currently on the market in Miami-Dade – and a centerpiece of what’s referred to as Miami’s “Billionaire’s Triangle,” where the exclusive enclaves of Indian Creek, Surfside, and Bal Harbour converge. Residences range from four to five bedrooms, start at $15 million, and average approximately 8,000 square feet – with overall pricing averaging $40 million.

 All homes at The Delmore are fully finished, featuring private elevator entries and sweeping views of the Atlantic Ocean, Intracoastal Waterway, and Downtown Miami. Penthouses begin at 10,000 square feet and offer expanded layouts across the top floors of the 12-story boutique building.

 Sales activity is being driven by private showings at The Delmore’s new 4,500-square-foot sales gallery, located at 301 71st Street in Miami Beach. The by-appointment-only space offers an early look at the craftsmanship and scale of the ZHA-designed tower, featuring an overhead digital projection of the project’s translucent sky-high pool and an impeccably finished model living area.

 The development will offer more than 55,000 square feet of amenities, including the 75-foot sky-high translucent pool, a state-of-the-art fitness center, an indoor lap pool, and an immersive meditation garden. A Michelin-caliber restaurant, exclusive to residents and guests, further distinguishes the property. Each of The Delmore’s two wings will feature no more than two residences per floor, maximizing privacy and prestige.

 Completion is anticipated in 2029. For more information, or to schedule a private appointment, visit thedelmore.com.
