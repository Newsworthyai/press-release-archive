# Q&amp;A with Hakan Yurdakul, CEO and Co-Founder at Bolt Insight

Hakan Yurdakul launched BoltChatAI with his Co-Founders in May 2018. A passion for wanting to create a ‘direct line’ to consumers and a vision ‘as if you were sitting next to them’, leveraging AI to efficiently compile qualitative customer feedback, yet uncovering subtle and significant details to help teams to gain a deeper understanding of their customers. This feedback proved invaluable in placing customer insight at the core of businesses.

 What is Bolt Insight and what does it do?

 Bolt Insight is a global research company built for the speed and complexity of modern business. Our AI-moderated ‘Qual at Scale’ platform, BoltChatAI, is redefining how brands run qualitative research.

 We use conversational AI to engage directly with consumers in real time, across 50+ markets, allowing clients to gather high-quality insights quickly, across markets and formats. From testing early ideas to refining creative concepts or exploring new markets, BoltChatAI delivers the depth of qual with the efficiency of tech.

 When was Bolt founded and what inspired you to create the BoltChatAI platform?

 We launched Bolt Insight in 2019 with a mission to bring the voice of the consumer closer to decision-makers. Having worked client-side at one of the world’s largest FMCG companies myself, I saw how difficult it was to get deep insight quickly.

 Research was often too slow, too expensive or too rigid to support agile decision-making. That’s what inspired BoltChatAI, a platform that combines the depth of qualitative interviews with the agility of AI. Our goal was to make it easier for teams to listen, learn and act, faster.

 What is your role and what impact have you seen from how insights are perceived? How valuable do you think it is for customers?

 As CEO and Co-Founder, I work closely with both our product and client teams. What we’re seeing is a real shift in how insights are valued. Insight teams have long been essential, but what’s changed is how visible and influential their work has become across the business.

 Marketing, product and commercial teams are now building insight directly into their workflows. When insight is delivered in the right format, at the right time, it becomes a strategic asset.

 How have you seen AI for consumer insights evolve over the last few years?

 It’s gone from automation to augmentation. A few years ago, AI in research mostly meant speeding up analysis. Now, it’s powering real-time conversations, generating summaries, identifying themes and even building dynamic personas that learn and evolve with each new study.

 With BoltChatAI, teams can create audience segments from real data, interact with them in real time and compare how motivations shift over time or across markets.

 The biggest leap is in usability. Platforms like ours are built by researchers for researchers. That means tools are designed around how real qualitative work happens, making it easier to go from data to decision.

 Do you have examples of customer success stories where insights have played a crucial part?

 Absolutely. One global brand recently used BoltChatAI to test a series of unbranded product ideas across the US market. They needed to understand reactions across different demographics and identify any early red flags.

 Within days, they gathered hundreds of in-depth responses, uncovering not only which ideas resonated most, but why. That depth allowed them to refine their concepts quickly and align internal teams around a clear direction.

 Which industry do you feel is most benefitting from consumer insights?

 FMCG is one of the fastest-moving sectors and continues to be a major adopter of agile insight. Brands need to stay on top of shifting behaviours, cultural trends and product expectations.

 But we’re also seeing strong growth in healthcare, retail and financial services, where empathy, speed and regulatory confidence all matter. Any industry that needs to understand people in context will benefit from the kind of qual-at-scale approach we offer.

 What fundamental shifts are you seeing in how members of the Board are perceiving insights and is this helping companies in their decision-making?

 There’s growing recognition that good insights drive competitive advantage. Board-level leaders are asking more questions about consumers, not fewer. They want evidence, clarity and speed.

 Insight teams that can deliver this in the language of the business are earning a seat at the table. AI is helping here by turning complex qual data into executive-ready narratives. That shift is raising the profile of insights across organisations.

 What’s next for AI in consumer insights and what excites you most in this space?

 We’re heading towards truly conversational intelligence. Where brands can engage with living, learning consumer personas, test ideas in real time and explore sentiment shifts across time and regions. What excites me most is how insight is becoming always on and self serve.

 You no longer need to commission a new study for every question. Platforms like BoltChatAI let you explore past data, track trends and generate hypotheses in minutes. That changes the role of research from reactive to continuous.

 What’s the secret to your success?

 Staying close to the problem. We’re researchers at heart. We built BoltChatAI by listening to what wasn’t working in traditional qual and reimagining it through the lens of AI and real-world research practice.

 Our team combines deep research expertise with product and AI talent, and we’ve never lost sight of the human side of insight. The secret is empathy, speed and relentless curiosity.
