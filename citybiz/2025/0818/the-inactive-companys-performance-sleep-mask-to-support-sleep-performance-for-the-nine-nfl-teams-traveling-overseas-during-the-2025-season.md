# The Inactive Company’s Performance Sleep Mask to Support Sleep Performance for the Nine NFL Teams Traveling Overseas During the 2025 Season

The Inactive Company will supply its patented Inactivators Performance Sleep Masks to nine NFL teams traveling overseas for games during the 2025 season. Each team will receive 75 masks, giving players a scientifically supported, drug-free way to improve sleep, enhance performance, and support recovery during international travel.

 Since March 2022, The Inactive Company has worked with the NFL Players Association (NFLPA), integrating Inactivators into key initiatives such as the NFL Draft, NFLPA Rookie Premiere, the NFLPA PAIR Program for injured reserve players, the IR Guide, and other health and wellness programs. This is the second year the NFLPA has chosen Inactivators as a performance and wellness tool for teams competing abroad, reflecting the increasing recognition of sleep as a vital factor in athletic success.

 The Inactivators were designed for elite athletes, featuring patented Tru-dark technology for full light blocking, pressure-free eye zones to protect REM sleep, thermoregulation to prevent overheating, self-adjusting straps, and an anatomical fit. With team permission, masks can be customized with team logos, highlighting their role as essential performance equipment.

 “Players tell us they know sleep is the ultimate performance enhancer, impacting everything from reaction times to injury prevention and recovery,” said Lori Oliver, co-founder of The Inactive Company. “But they struggle to prioritize it, especially with late-night device use and demanding schedules. Inactivators give them a simple, effective tool to achieve high-quality sleep, whether at home or on the road.”

 Scientific research underscores the importance of sleep for athletes. Studies show that poor sleep impairs reaction times, decision-making, and immune function while increasing injury risk. A 2023 study in Sports Medicine found that sleep interventions, like those provided by Inactivators, improve performance and recovery in athletes.

 “Coaches have told us they need external reinforcement to emphasize sleep’s importance to players,” said Jill MacRae, co-founder of The Inactive Company. “By integrating team logos and making Inactivators part of the performance kit, we’re helping players see sleep as a competitive edge, especially during the challenges of international travel.”

 International games present unique challenges such as disruptions to circadian rhythms, unpredictable lighting conditions, and physiological stress from transatlantic flights. Inactivators’ ergonomic, travel-friendly design ensures consistent, high-quality sleep, supporting melatonin production and uninterrupted REM cycles essential for memory consolidation, reaction time, and physical recovery.

 By providing players with Inactivators, the NFLPA emphasizes maintaining competitive integrity and player safety worldwide. This collaboration highlights a commitment to using advanced, science-based tools to help NFLPA player members perform at their best, properly recover and return home healthy.

 The nine teams playing overseas during the 2025 season include Pittsburgh Steelers, Minnesota Vikings, Cleveland Browns, New York Jets, Los Angels Rams, Atlanta Falcons, Indianapolis Colts, Miami Dolphins and Washington Commanders.
