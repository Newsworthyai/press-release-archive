# SRS Real Estate Partners Announces $9.35 Million Sale of a Newly Developed KinderCare Property in Broomfield, CO

SRS Real Estate Partners has completed the $9.35 million sale of a KinderCare property located at 1101 Spring Place in Broomfield, CO. With construction completed in early 2025, the nearly 12,000-square-foot property is situated on 1.42 acres and has a 15-year corporate-guaranteed, triple net lease in place.

 SRS Capital Markets Vice President Ryan Tomkins represented the seller, a Denver-based private developer. The buyer was a Kansas City-based private investor who was in a 1031 exchange.

 “This KinderCare property offers the new owner a favorable combination of limited management responsibilities, a secure national tenant, and a brand-new long-term lease — all positioned in a booming master-planned community. With its proximity to the new Center St development within the Baseline community, this location is primed for exceptional long-term value,” said Tomkins.

 Headquartered in Portland, OR, KinderCare operates more than 2,400 locations in 40 states and is the nation’s largest private provider of child care.

 Broomfield is approximately 18 miles north of Denver and is the fastest growing city in Colorado and is one of the fastest growing cities in the United States.

 This year, SRS Capital Markets has completed more than $1.2 billion in deal volume comprised of more than 350 transactions across the nation. SRS currently has in excess of 845 properties actively on the market with a market value surpassing $3.7 billion.
