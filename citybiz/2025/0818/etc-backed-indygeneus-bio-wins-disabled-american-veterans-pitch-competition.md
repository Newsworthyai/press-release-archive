# ETC-Backed IndyGeneUS Bio Wins Disabled American Veterans Pitch Competition

A Baltimore life sciences startup, a portfolio company of Emerging Technology Centers, has won national recognition for its work in genomics. IndyGeneUS Bio, led by founder and chief executive Yusuf Henriques, took first place in the Disabled American Veterans Pitch Competition, which spotlights veteran-owned companies.

 Henriques, a U.S. Army veteran, launched IndyGeneUS Bio with the mission of making genomic research and data more inclusive, particularly for underserved and minority populations. The company is building a global genomics data repository designed to close long-standing gaps in medical research and improve health outcomes for diverse communities.

 Emerging Technology Centers, Baltimore’s technology and innovation incubator, counts IndyGeneUS Bio among its portfolio companies. ETC officials said the firm’s win highlights both the strength of Baltimore’s startup ecosystem and the potential for veteran entrepreneurs to play an outsized role in emerging industries.

 IndyGeneUS Bio’s recognition comes at a time when precision medicine and genomics are drawing increased investor attention. Venture funding in life sciences has remained resilient despite market volatility, with startups focused on health equity and data diversity attracting particular interest.
