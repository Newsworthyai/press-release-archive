# Energy Products Earns a Spot on The Inc. 5000 List of Fastest Growing Private Companies in America for the Second Consecutive Year

Inc. has revealed that Energy Products has once again secured a spot on the annual Inc. 5000 list of the fastest-growing private companies in America, marking their second consecutive year receiving this prestigious honor. The Inc. 5000 provides a data driven look at the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment of independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Microsoft, Facebook/Meta, Chobani, Under Armour, Timberland, Oracle, Patagonia, and many other name brands have gained national exposure as honorees on the Inc. 5000 previously.

 Brett Smith, President of Energy Products, stated, “To earn a place on the Inc. 5000 list two years in a row is an incredible accomplishment. This achievement reflects the dedication, drive, and relentless effort of our entire team. I am proud of what we have built together and excited for the growth we still have ahead.”

 “Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” says Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm, they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”

 Headquartered in Madison Heights, Michigan, Energy Products Inc. has experienced significant growth in recent years, leading the battery distribution industry. With a focus on adding value to the supply chain and an entrepreneurial mindset, the company has expanded its footprint to include locations in Michigan, Indiana, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Minnesota, and Mississippi.
