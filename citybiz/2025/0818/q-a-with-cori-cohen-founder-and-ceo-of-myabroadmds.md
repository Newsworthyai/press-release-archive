# Q&amp;A with Cori Cohen, Founder and CEO of MyAbroadMDs

Cori Cohen is the Founder and CEO of MyAbroadMDs, the premier proactive digital platform designed to connect international travelers with top-tier, English-speaking medical care across the globe—before they need it.

 The idea was born from Cohen’s firsthand experience helping her children access reliable healthcare while studying abroad. In an age where remote work, global mobility, and travel flexibility are the norm, Cohen recognized a critical need: a bespoke and sophisticated tool to help individuals feel secure and informed when it comes to their health abroad.

 Since its start, the biz has evolved as a tool for anyone who is planning a family vacation, working remotely from another country, preparing for a destination wedding, and so much more. MyAbroadMDs equips travelers with curated healthcare resources and verified provider access—so users can feel confident, supported, and prepared no matter where they are in the world. For those managing medical conditions, the platform facilitates direct introductions to English-speaking specialists before departure to ensure continuity of care. The platform also offers corporate benefits packages, white labeling, and licensing solutions for organizations.

 In a world that no longer operates within borders, MyAbroadMDs offers a tailored, affordable solution that supports wellness through every stage of travel—empowering users to go further, live healthier, and explore with confidence. This proactive approach makes healthcare preparation an essential part of travel planning. Memberships range from $49-$499 with customized pricing for corporate clients depending on your needs, as well as concierge offerings.

 MyAbroadMDs was born from your personal experience helping your children access reliable healthcare while studying abroad. Can you walk us through that moment when you realized there was a gap in the market and how it inspired you to create the platform?  Five years ago, my daughter was packing for her semester abroad. In addition to the clothes and textbooks, she carried something none of her friends had—a personalized network of English-speaking doctors mapped to every city on her European itinerary. I didn’t get that list from her school, from insurance, or from a Google search. I built it myself.

 I had spent years co-running MD Medical Navigators with my husband, Jonathan, so I had access to top doctors worldwide. But as a mom, my real fear wasn’t emergencies—hospitals handle those—it was the everyday health needs that could derail a semester: a UTI in Florence, an anxiety attack in Prague, running out of birth control in Madrid. Those moments often leave travelers stranded because they don’t know who to call.

 City by city, specialist by specialist, I built her a resource that worked. She shared it with friends. Their parents called me. Soon I was fielding requests for other countries, other conditions, other families. When my son’s fraternity at the University of Michigan went abroad, I expanded the list again—and watched it spread through Greek life, then campus-wide. That’s when I realized: this wasn’t just a safety net for my own kids. I had uncovered a massive gap in how we prepare travelers for their health abroad.

 Many healthcare solutions are reactive, but MyAbroadMDs takes a proactive approach. Why was it so important for you to design the platform this way, and how does that fundamentally change the travel health experience?  Because when you’re sick in a foreign country, you don’t have time for Google searches and trial-and-error phone calls. I learned quickly that reactive care creates chaos and delays—especially with language barriers. Our model flips that. Every MyAbroadMDs member leaves home with a doctor directory tailored to their exact destinations, and if they have preexisting conditions, we connect them with the right specialist before they even leave.

 This changes everything. Instead of crossing their fingers and hoping nothing happens, travelers know exactly where to go and who to call. They can advocate for themselves, avoid unnecessary ER visits, and get back to enjoying their trip faster. That shift—from uncertainty to confidence—is the heart of our value.

 The platform has evolved far beyond its initial focus on students studying abroad. What have been some of the most surprising or creative ways people are now using MyAbroadMDs?  We started with students, but today our members include corporate executives relocating overseas, honeymooners, retirees moving abroad, cruise travelers, and high-net-worth individuals managing complex medical needs. One of my favorites? Newlyweds getting our “Sickness & Health” membership as a wedding gift. Families tell me it’s “the gift you hope they’ll never need—but you’ll be glad they have.”

 We’ve also worked with companies who send teams abroad for months at a time, making sure every employee has the same healthcare continuity they’d have at home. And increasingly, concierge doctors and law firms are using us for their clients’ international moves.

 With your 25+ years in marketing, PR, and strategic partnerships, how have you leveraged that business background to differentiate MyAbroadMDs from other healthcare or travel assistance services?  From day one, I treated MyAbroadMDs like a brand that needed to stand apart, not just a service. That meant positioning us around proactive healthcare, not reactive crisis response. I built relationships in sectors that already value preparation and peace of mind—luxury travel, corporate benefits, global education—so that our model could be offered as part of a bigger lifestyle or business travel solution.

 I also leaned into storytelling. This isn’t just a tech platform; it’s a mother’s solution that became a global movement. When you combine that authenticity with a clear value proposition—healthcare that travels with you—you get traction across industries that traditionally haven’t touched travel health.

 You’ve built the company alongside your husband, Dr. Jonathan Cohen, who brings deep medical expertise. How do your business and medical perspectives complement each other in shaping the platform’s vision and execution?  Jonathan has spent decades building relationships with doctors and specialists around the world, and he’s the one who opened the door for me to connect with so many of them personally. Those introductions—especially to highly regarded specialists—were the foundation of our global network. From there, I took on the role of ensuring our directories are clinically sound, comprehensive, and easy for travelers to navigate. My background in marketing and operations allows me to package these medical resources in a way that’s intuitive, accessible, and scalable, while Jonathan continues to expand our reach through his professional connections. Together, we’ve created a bridge between trusted medical relationships and a traveler-friendly platform.

 Corporate benefits packages and white-labeling are unique offerings for a health travel platform. How do these partnerships expand MyAbroadMDs’ reach, and what industries are showing the most interest?  These partnerships allow companies, universities, and agencies to offer our services as part of their own programs. It gives them an instant global healthcare infrastructure without having to build it themselves. Industries most interested so far include global education, insurance, relocation services, luxury travel agencies, and professional associations with members who work abroad. It’s also resonating with companies that have a duty of care for employees but want to go beyond basic insurance.

 The app is launching early this fall—what new features or capabilities can travelers expect, and how do you see the platform evolving in the next few years?  The app will make our process even faster. Travelers can take a quick quiz, pay securely, and receive their curated doctor directory instantly via email. They’ll also have access to the PIMS Vault—a fully private space to store health and travel documents—and can request a doctor on the go without waiting for a third-party booking service.

 In the next few years, I see us integrating AI to make doctor recommendations even more precise, licensing our directory system globally, and partnering with more hospitals and educational institutions. But our mission will stay the same: make healthcare as portable as your passport.
