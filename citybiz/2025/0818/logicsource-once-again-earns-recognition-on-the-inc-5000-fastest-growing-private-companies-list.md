# LogicSource Once Again Earns Recognition on the Inc. 5000 Fastest-Growing Private Companies List

LogicSource, the leader in technology-enabled procurement services, is pleased to announce its placement on the Inc. 5000 list of fastest-growing private companies in America. This honor comes as LogicSource hits its single-year new business record, building on the momentum of the firm’s 103% growth rate over the last three years.

 The Inc. 5000 list is an exclusive annual ranking of the strongest businesses in America’s most competitive economic verticals. This achievement reinforces LogicSource’s position as a strategic partner to companies across consumer and healthcare sectors, especially amid complex global trade dynamics.

 “Our consistent growth reflects the strength of our team and the value we bring to clients across diverse industries, including retail, healthcare, and private equity,” said David Pennino, founder and CEO at LogicSource. “This year has been especially complex, but also rewarding, as organizations manage tariff policy changes, regulatory hurdles and trade disruptions. We’re walking alongside our clients, helping them make smarter sourcing decisions and securing financial and operational strength.”

 Since its first Inc. 5000 recognition in 2020, LogicSource has significantly expanded its client roster, executive leadership, and geographic footprint. The firm draws on more than $150 billion in managed spend and pricing data and a team of over 180 indirect spend category experts to help top brands recover costs and achieve greater levels of innovation.

 This rapid growth comes at a critical time as leaders must regain fiscal stability and supply chain resilience. LogicSource has become a trusted advisor on tariff policy through its routine tariff analysis reports, guidance on procurement best practices and risk mitigation strategies. The company continues to deepen its cross-industry spend benchmarks and expertise, providing clear data and insights for clients to renegotiate contracts, reduce indirect expenditures, and reinvest crucial dollars into high-value priorities.

 This announcement follows a long track record of industry leadership and success for LogicSource. The firm’s continued ranking on the Inc. 5000 list builds upon past accolades from Financial Times, Boston Globe, Modern Healthcare, Supply & Demand Chain Executive, Statista, Everest Group and Spend Matters.
