# The Newbury of Brookline Introduces Respite Care Program for Boston-Area Seniors

The Newbury of Brookline, the newest addition to Kisco Senior Living’s national portfolio of Signature communities, is pleased to announce its new respite care program.

 The program at The Newbury provides temporary accommodations for seniors, offering personalized care, spacious residences, chef-prepared meals that meet an array of dietary needs, a robust calendar of life-enriching programs and personalized concierge services. One example of programming is Tovertafel, also known as Tover, which is an interactive game projection system designed for complex and differentiated care needs, supporting social, physical, sensory, and cognitive wellbeing.

 “We are excited to introduce the respite program to our community,” said Frances Bates, general manager at The Newbury of Brookline. “Adult children who are caring for their parents often face significant challenges, and our respite program offers them peace of mind knowing their loved ones are in a safe and caring environment while they are away.”

 Caregiver stress is a growing concern in the U.S., with more than 11 million Americans providing unpaid care for individuals with dementia. Studies show that 70% of these caregivers find coordinating care to be highly stressful.

 “Programs like The Newbury’s respite care offer essential relief, giving caregivers the opportunity to rest and recharge,” said Bates. “This is something that is needed in our community and we can fill that void.”
