# Building Bonds and Giving Back: Miramar Park of Commerce Strengthens Support for “Hangin’ with 5-0” Police-Youth Camp

Beach Clean-Up and Barbeque Marks Growing Community Impact

 Campers from the Miramar Police Athletic League’s free summer program, “Hangin’ with 5-0,” joined Miramar police officers for a beach clean-up and celebratory barbecue at Hollywood North Park Beach. The event was proudly sponsored by Sunbeam Properties & Development and the Miramar Park of Commerce, long-time champions of the impactful youth initiative.

 Now celebrating more than 20 years of service, “Hangin’ with 5-0” offers underserved Miramar students, ages nine to 14, a summer of positive experiences, from beach days and Everglades tours to movie outings and mentorship, with the goal of building trust between youth and local law enforcement.

 To help the program grow and reach even more young people, Sunbeam Properties & Development and the Miramar Park of Commerce increased its support this year, continuing a legacy that began 16 years ago when Sunbeam stepped in to fund the camp following city budget cuts.

 “This program creates real, lasting impact for young people in our community,” said Ryan Goggins, Vice President at Sunbeam Properties & Development. “We’re proud to increase our support this year so more Miramar students can build strong, positive relationships with local law enforcement and enjoy a safe and enriching summer.”

 “Hangin’ with 5-0” is more than a camp, it’s a vital nonprofit community initiative that’s helped shape positive relationships between officers and at-risk youth for over two decades.

 Beyond this program, Sunbeam Properties & Development has long supported the City of Miramar through a variety of local causes and nonprofit organizations. Contributions have included funding for the Ansin Sports Complex, the Ansin Family Gallery at the Miramar Cultural Center, as well as hosting supply and toy drives for military families, local children and United Way of Broward County.
