# Ann’s Choice’s Drums Alive Classes Offer Fun, Fitness, And Friendship

At Ann’s Choice, an Erickson Senior Living community in Bucks County, Pa., residents can choose from a range of fun, creative ways to stay active.

 The community’s new Drums Alive program, which blends aerobic movement with rhythmic drumming, is one of them.

 “It’s really resonated with residents looking to enhance their well-being in a lively, social environment,” says Fitness Coordinator Kathleen Mish.

 Growing popularity

 Each 30-minute Drums Alive session includes a warm-up, an energizing main workout, and a cooldown. Using exercise balls balanced on buckets as drums, participants move in time to choreographed routines that are feasible yet challenging.

 Given the fun, lively nature of the classes, Drums Alive has quickly grown into one of the most sought-after activities on campus.

 “Classes started small with about five or six residents. In fact, we called it our best kept secret,” Mish recalls, with a laugh. “Once word spread, more residents became curious and wanted to participate. Now, there are around 20 people per class, and there is always a waiting list. We’re glad the secret got out!”

 For resident Ruth Worms, who has been a part of the Drums Alive program since its inception, the appeal is simple: “It’s a lot of fun, it’s exercise, and you meet nice people,” she says.

 This sense of enjoyment is what keeps Ruth–and many others–coming back week after week.

 Something for everyone

 Ann’s Choice currently offers three weekly Drums Alive classes: a standing class, a seated class, and a hybrid option. Each session is capped at 20 participants, and all necessary equipment is provided.

 And no experience is needed to join–just a willingness to try something new. “The program is designed to be inclusive and adaptable, making it accessible for all people, including seniors with varying physical and cognitive abilities,” says Mish.

 Ruth often encourages her neighbors to give it a try. “I’ve had people come to class because I said, ‘Just try it. It’s fun,'” she shares.

 Full-body benefits

 The Drums Alive program offers numerous health benefits.

 “Some of the key benefits of the class include improved cardiovascular health, enhanced mobility and coordination, strengthened muscles and joints, and improved balance and stability,” explains Mish. “Many of the moves involve the lower body, which can help reduce the risk of falls.”

 She continues, “Residents with arthritis or limited mobility have reported better movement in their arms and legs. Some have mentioned an increase in balance and coordination, leading to more confidence in daily activities.”

 Tara Beach, fitness manager at Ann’s Choice, notes that the classes deliver cognitive improvements

 as well.

 “Drumming has been found to increase the neurological connection between the two brain hemispheres, stimulating alpha brain wave activity, which can lead to higher levels of concentration and sensory and motor improvement,” she explains. “It’s also linked to enhanced neuroplasticity. The rhythm and movement stimulate neural connections, which can help delay cognitive decline.”

 Community connection

 Beyond the physical and cognitive benefits, Drums Alive fosters a strong sense of camaraderie.

 “Drumming in a group setting creates a shared experience, promoting teamwork and coordination,” says Beach. “Residents work together to create rhythms, fostering a feeling of unity and inclusion.”

 Ruth and her classmates credit the instructors with helping create such a lively environment. “They are so enthusiastic,” says Ruth.

 “Our instructors choose the music and choreograph a routine that prioritizes safety but encourages growth,” explains Mish. “Songs are rotated in and out all the time, so the classes stay fresh.”

 Looking ahead

 A variety of other exercise classes and amenities, like the fitness center and swimming pool, are available for residents to stay active, but Drums Alive participants emphasize that few other workouts are as engaging as drumming.

 As Ruth puts it, “It’s fun! And it just happens to sound good too.”

 “We’ve heard nothing but great things about the program,” says Mish. “We hope to improve upon and add to our offerings in the future to keep residents excited about staying active.”
