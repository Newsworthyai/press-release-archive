# Q&amp;A with Will Bartholomew, Founder of D1 Sports Training

Will Bartholomew founded D1 Sports Training in 2001 in his hometown of Nashville, TN.

 His passion for sport developed early, earning All-State honors in three sports in high school (football, wresting, and track). Will followed his passion for sport to The University of Tennessee where he played fullback for Peyton Manning. While at Tennessee, Will won the 1998 National Championship and captained the team in 2001. At Tennessee, he found his passion for lifting and the training foundation for D1 Sports Training.

 Will’s vision for D1 grew into a multi-million-dollar company with over 150 training locations across the country. Men’s Health recognized D1 as a TOP 30 Gym. D1 is acknowledged as one of the 50 fastest growing companies.

 There’s a growing desire among consumers to connect their fitness routines with a deeper sense of purpose and identity. I liken it to the YMCA’s mind-body-spirit approach

 Will’s involvement in his community goes beyond D1. He is a part of the Young President Organization. In his personal life Will is married to Shelly Bartholomew, former Miss Teen USA, and current model. They have three children Nolyn, Ty, and Mack.

 Can you share a bit about your background and what inspired you to found D1 Training?

 I grew up in Nashville in a household steeped in sports and discipline—my dad and grandfather were West Point grads and military veterans, and my mom was a minister, so service and structure were part of everyday life. I played multiple sports and earned All-State honors in football, wrestling, and track in high school. Then I went on to play fullback at the University of Tennessee alongside Peyton Manning, where I was fortunate to help our team win the 1998 National Championship and serve as team captain in 2001.

 I pursued a dream of playing in the NFL, but during my rookie training camp with the Denver Broncos, I suffered a knee injury that ended my playing career. Rehab exposed me to a glaring gap—there was nowhere to train like at a Division 1 school or pro facility when I came home. That’s when it clicked—I needed to create that place. In 2002, I founded D1 in Nashville to replicate elite-level training for athletes of all ages.

 What is D1 Training?

 D1 Training is an athletic-based fitness franchise built on the premise that anyone with a goal—be it sports performance or personal fitness—is an athlete. We operate facilities equipped like Division 1 training centers, offering small-group classes, semi-private, and one-on-one coaching.

 Our core programs—Scholastic (ages 7–18) and Adult—are built around five pillars: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength training, core & conditioning, and cool-down. D1 is more than just a gym; it’s “the place for the athlete”, providing both structure and community in a premium boutique setting—where clients are paying not only for equipment, but also coaching, accountability, and results.

 D1 operates as a franchise model and today we have over 150 open locations with hundreds more in development. We’ve trained professional athletes, college athletes, and thousands of others—all grounded in our belief that with the right environment, anyone can unlock their athletic potential.

 

 How are the needs of today’s franchisees evolving, and how is D1 meeting those changes?

 Franchisees today are asking for more than just a playbook — they’re looking for ongoing innovation, data-driven insights, and simplified operations. D1 is meeting those evolving needs in several ways:

 * Data-Led Innovation: With national reach and more robust data collection, D1 can now track trends across all locations. This allows them to deliver timely, strategic programming (like seasonal competitions) that aligns with what athletes want most at specific times of year.
* Dashboards and KPI Tracking: Every facility now has access to a performance dashboard showing key metrics in real time (red/yellow/green status), which helps owners and support teams identify strengths and areas for improvement.
* Simplification and Automation: D1 is streamlining the business model by pursuing national contracts, sponsorships, and simplifying operations — all with the goal of reducing the operational load on franchisees.
* High-Touch Onboarding Support: D1 has developed an intensive early-support program to ensure that new franchisees receive hands-on guidance during their critical first months, setting them up for long-term success.

 Where is D1 placing its bets next?

 D1 is investing heavily in digital infrastructure and education:

 * The Digital Home for the Athlete: D1 is positioning itself to be not just a physical location for training, but the digital home for athletes. The app is being built out to provide value beyond workouts — offering engagement, information, and tools athletes want to return to regularly.
* Coach Education & Certification: D1 is also investing in making D1 coaching a mark of quality. With frequent regional training events, the organization is creating a consistent, elevated standard for staff development — ensuring that being “D1 Certified” means something across the country.

 Why is there such strong demand for purpose-driven fitness concepts like D1 right now?

 There’s a growing desire among consumers to connect their fitness routines with a deeper sense of purpose and identity. I liken it to the YMCA’s mind-body-spirit approach:

 * Psychological Transformation: When people set physical goals and start to reach them, it activates a belief that they can transform any area of their life — not just their body.
* Mission-Driven Community: D1 resonates because it’s not just about fitness — it’s about athletic identity, achievement, and growth. That sense of belonging to something bigger creates a lasting impact, especially in today’s culture where purpose matters more than ever.

 What does it take to succeed as both a franchise system and an owner in today’s market?

 Success comes down to three key principles:

 1. Accountability — To ourselves, our team, the system, and our customers. Ownership requires showing up with consistency and integrity.
2. Staffing and Development — Just like building a great sports team, winning in business requires drafting the right people and developing them well.
3. Relationships — At every level, from coach to client to corporate support, strong relationships drive results. The best-performing D1 locations all have standout relational cultures that foster trust, loyalty, and performance.
