# State Roundup: June Heat Wave Kills Eight, Sends 472 For Medical Care; Field Of Candidates To Unseat Gov. Moore Grows; Bay Agreement Revised

JUNE HEAT WAVE DEATHS HIT 8 IN ONE WEEK, WITH 472 SEEKING CARE: A late June heat wave led to skyrocketing emergency room visits and boosted the number of heat deaths this year from one to eight in a single week. State Health Department data shows that 472 people had to seek emergency care for heat-related illnesses from June 22 through June 28, a week in which parts of Maryland saw a heat index of up to 110 degrees during the hottest parts of the day. That’s a significant increase from the previous week, when 93 people landed in emergency departments across the state, and trends higher than previous heat-related illness data from recent years.

 FIELD GROWS IN RACE TO UNSEAT GOV. MOORE: There’s a growing field of candidates vying to steal Democratic Gov. Wes Moore’s seat ahead of the 2026 primary election. Though only one candidate has officially filed with the State Board of Elections, four Republicans, two Democrats, and one Green Party candidate have publicly stated that they have their eyes on Maryland’s chief executive position.

 REVISED BAY AGREEMENT DATA-DRIVEN FOR TARGETS: When they last signed a Chesapeake Bay cleanup agreement in 2014, officials from seven jurisdictions set ambitious targets and a hard deadline of 2025. They didn’t quite make it. So as they drafted the next agreement, released to the public last Tuesday, they did things a little differently: Some targets shifted, deadlines were staggered and some goals have yet to be set, awaiting new computer modeling that will show the most up-to-date picture of bay pollutants.

 WITHOUT INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS, STATE ECONOMY OUT $1 BILLION: The Trump administration has created a hostile climate for students from foreign countries studying in the U.S. One result: International students are less and less likely to be able to — or want to — study in this country. If their presence decreases, that could be disastrous for Maryland. International students and recent graduates infuse $1 billion into the state’s economy, supporting 10,180 jobs, according to data from NAFSA: the Association of International Educators.

 HOWARD COUNTY’s NEW FLAG RAISED: Howard County officially raised its new flag Monday in front of the county’s George Howard Building. The design by long-time county resident and designer Esen Paradiso won a year-long competition that attracted 209 entries from 102 individuals. The new flag was approved by the County Council and signed into law by the executive in May. Len Lazarick/Maryland Reporter.

 * County Executive Calvin Ball praised the flag as “a new symbol of our government, our community, our future.” “I want to recognize the 56 years that the prior flag flew,” Ball said at the Monday event. “May it be retired to the annals of our history and may its successor wave wonderfully and evoke feelings and values upon which it was designed.” April Santana/The Baltimore Sun.

 BA CO COUNCILMAN SEEKS TO DE-POLITICIZE CHOOSING INSPECTORS GENERAL: Baltimore County Councilman Izzy Patoka said Monday that he will introduce legislation to amend the Baltimore County charter and establish an independent board to choose future inspectors general, instead of having the county executive choose them. The move is an effort to rebuild trust in what Patoka said has become a “politicized” process. Rona Kobell/The Baltimore Banner.

 BA CO COUNCIL REJECTS LOAN TO HOUSING DEVELOPER: The Baltimore County Council on Monday rejected giving the developer of a planned affordable housing complex in East Towson an additional $2 million loan to help the project get built. The council’s unanimous vote against giving the loan to Homes for America, the Annapolis-based nonprofit developer of Red Maple Place, comes a week after the council and residents shared their hesitations about granting the request for extra funding. Natalie Jones/The Baltimore Sun.

 * Council members took turns berating the project, a 56-unit affordable housing complex known as Red Maple Place, that has evolved since its 2018 origins into one of the most controversial land use deals in the Baltimore area. Hallie Miller/The Baltimore Banner.

 SUPREME COURT RULING ON MO CO SCHOOLS ‘OPT-OP’ NOT THE FINAL WORD: Harford County Public Schools Superintendent Sean Bulson knows that school administrators “should be thrilled that parents want to be involved” in their children’s education. He also knows that there can be a point when parents get too involved, acknowledging the potential administrative burden of trying to anticipate everything that a parent might find objectionable in the classroom. His comments were in response to the recent Supreme Court ruling that said Montgomery County schools need to notify parents when LGBTQ-themed books are used in the classroom, and give parents the chance to opt their children out.

 JUSTICE DEPT THREATENS TO DEPORT ABREGO GARCIA IF HE IS RELEASED: The Justice Department said it would deport Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia again — though not to his native El Salvador — if he is freed from federal custody as he awaits trial in Tennessee on human smuggling charges, a U.S. government attorney told a federal court judge Tuesday. “The plan currently is to remove him to a third country,” Jonathan Guynn, the attorney, told Maryland U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis. Jeff Barker/The Baltimore Sun.

 * “It’s like trying to nail Jell-O to a wall to figure out what’s going to happen next week,” Judge Xinis said during a three-hour hearing. She appeared incredulous over the administration’s lack of a definite plan for doing so, grilling Justice Department attorneys for details on what country officials are considering and how the deportation would proceed. Steve Thompson/The Washington Post.
* “We do need protection from the government waking up tomorrow and upon Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release from criminal custody, (removing him) to somewhere they haven’t identified,” said Andrew J. Rossman, of Quinn Emmanuel, the firm representing Abrego Garcia in his immigration case in Maryland. Ariana Figueroa/Maryland Matters.

 HAYDEN LANDS ROLE WITH MELLON FOUNDATION: Carla Hayden, the former head of the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore and the former librarian of Congress abruptly fired by President Donald Trump, has found a new position with the country’s largest philanthropic supporter of the arts, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Hayden joined the humanities grantmaker Monday as a senior fellow whose duties will include advising on efforts to advance public knowledge through libraries and archives.

 SUSPENDED FBI AGENT ON TRIAL FOR RAPES: On Monday, FBI agent Eduardo Valdivia, who was acquitted of shooting an unarmed panhandler three years ago, returns to the same courthouse in Montgomery County for an entirely new case. Prosecutors say the 41-year-old raped three women — one who had just turned 18 — inside an off-hours tattoo operation he quietly ran under the alias “Lalo Brown.” Dan Morse/The Washington Post.
