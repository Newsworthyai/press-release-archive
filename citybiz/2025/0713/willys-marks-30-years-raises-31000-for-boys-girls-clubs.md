# Willy’s Marks 30 Years, Raises $31,000 For Boys &amp; Girls Clubs

Anniversary Celebration Includes Loyalty Discount on July 13, Showcasing Winning Boys & Girls Salsa on July 15, and Continued Summer Happy Hour Specials

 WHAT: Willy’s Mexicana Grill is capping off its annual fundraising campaign with a week of flavor and community celebration to mark its 30th anniversary.

 To celebrate its 30th anniversary on Sunday, July 13, Willy’s is offering its Willy Good Rewards members a 30% discount on all orders placed in-store, online on Willys.com or in the Willy’s app. Guests must sign up to be a member online by July 12 to be eligible for the discount.

 On Tuesday, July 15, the winning salsa from this year’s Salsa, Salsa! showdown will be served at Willy’s Roswell location (660 West Crossville Road) while supplies last.

BGCMA members will be on-site during lunch to share their salsa and celebrate with guests.

 This year, Willy’s turned up the heat with a goal to raise $30,000 in just 30 days through it’s Give $5/Get $5 fundraiser, and this week’s celebrations mark the culmination of the giving campaign that raised over $31,000 to support youth wellness and leadership programs through the Boys & Girls Clubs in Metro Atlanta, Athens and Bartow County.
