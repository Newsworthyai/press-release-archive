# Redwood Logistics Tackles Scope 3 Emissions with New ESG Report

Redwood Logistics, one of North America’s fastest-growing fourth party logistics (4PL) providers, has indicated a shifting landscape of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) compliance, with regulations like California’s Senate Bill 253 (SB253) and the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) driving significant changes. These policies bring logistical and financial challenges, emphasizing the need for effective strategies and partnerships to ensure compliance.

 “While the topic of ESG has grown more politicized in recent years, market-specific regulations such as California’s and the EU’s demand businesses to address compliance with tangible action, regardless of political sentiment,” said Nate Greensphan, Director of Product Management at Redwood. “Companies working in California with revenues exceeding $1 billion must prepare for reporting deadlines beginning January 2026.”

 Upcoming requirements for emissions reporting, particularly Scope 3, present unique challenges. While most companies are equipped for Scope 1 and Scope 2 reporting mandates in 2026, Scope 3 remains a significant hurdle due to data and knowledge gaps across supply chains. In large enterprises, all upstream and downstream Scope 3 data collection and emissions calculation can be a massively complex and costly effort, adding to the difficulties for businesses trying to meet regulatory mandates.

 Domestically, California’s SB253 legislation sets the stage, initially affecting approximately 5,400 companies across the United States by meeting the senate bills criteria of annual revenue and doing business in the state. The ripple effects are expected to impact supply chain-connected businesses as future ESG mandates expand. International companies complying with EU CSRD regulations often have a head start, while U.S.-only enterprises face greater readiness challenges. This will become especially true for Scope 3 reporting, which SB253 currently has set to begin in 2027.

 “Navigating these evolving regulations requires both foresight and adaptability,” notes Greensphan. “Companies that proactively align with international standards now will find themselves better equipped to handle the expanding web of ESG mandates globally.”

 Meanwhile, Gartner ranks ESG regulations and policies as the #2 business driver, showing that sustainability is not just compliance-driven but also a growing market demand. Customers, investors, and other stakeholders increasingly expect businesses to prioritize sustainability, making ESG a critical component of competitive advantage.

 “The demand for responsible corporate practices doesn’t just come from regulations; it comes from the people you serve,” added Greensphan. “Your customers are paying attention and choosing companies that align with their values.”

 Meeting these regulatory requirements and customer expectations demands substantial commitment beyond technology adoption; though technology enablement can provide critical support. Successful compliance requires dedicated time, resources, and strategic partnerships to navigate the regulatory landscape effectively. While companies can begin their ESG journeys with basic assessments and training, progressing into complex Scope 3 reporting necessitates advanced solutions that measure specific emission categories, including upstream and downstream transportation, significantly reducing the time and cost burden of compliance.

 Redwood Logistics addresses these Scope 3 challenges through its proprietary and innovative Redwood Hyperion platform. Redwood Hyperion provides granular visibility into transportation emissions across supply chains. The platform’s load-by-load emissions tracking capabilities enable companies to move beyond spend-based estimates to operational-level data accuracy, directly addressing the data gaps that make Scope 3 compliance so challenging. By delivering precise measurement of transportation-related emissions – a critical component of most companies’ Scope 3 footprint – Redwood empowers businesses to meet regulatory requirements while gaining actionable insights that drive meaningful sustainability progress.
