# REI Utility Services Named to Inc. 5000 List of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies

Inc., the leading media brand and playbook for the entrepreneurs and business leaders shaping our future, recently announced that REI Utility Services is No. 2,355 on the annual Inc. 5000 list, the most prestigious ranking of the fastest-growing private companies in America. The list provides a data-driven snapshot of the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Past honorees include companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Chobani, Under Armour, Timberland, Oracle, and Patagonia.

 “Our growth directly reflects the trust our utility partners place in us and the dedication of our team,” said Mitchell Mayo, Chief Executive Officer of REI Utility Services. “Being named to the Inc. 5000 list is an honor that validates our mission of delivering high-quality engineering, field services, and technology solutions that help power electric utilities across the Southern United States. We’re just getting started. As we continue to grow, our focus remains on expanding our services and innovating to support the evolving needs of the utility industry.”

 This year’s Inc. 5000 honorees have demonstrated exceptional growth while navigating economic uncertainty, inflationary pressure, and a fluctuating labor market. Among the top 500 companies on the list, the median three-year revenue growth rate reached 1,552 percent, and those companies have collectively added more than 48,678 jobs to the U.S. economy over the past three years.

“Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” says Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm—they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”
