# Bradenton Couple Opens First Perspire Sauna Studio in Heritage Harbour

A science-backed wellness business that promises to make you sweat will open on September 5th in Bradenton. Located at 7819 SR 64 E in the Heritage Harbour neighborhood, the new Perspire Sauna Studio, the country’s largest sauna studio franchise, will serve the local area by providing a unique wellness experience. With its addition of the state-of-the-art SNØ Shower, the brand now offers contrast therapy, combining full-spectrum infrared sauna and red-light therapy technology to detox the body, burn calories, improve sleep, ease pain, and more.

 The Heritage Harbour studio is owned and operated by Mike and Pamela Polikretis, Florida residents who were first introduced to Perspire Sauna Studio during a visit to the University Town Center location in Sarasota. The experience left such a lasting impression that the couple decided to bring the brand to their own community, launching their first business venture together. The Bradenton location is the first of three studios the Polikretises plan to open across the region, with a second location already underway in Apollo Beach and a third site targeted for West Bradenton or West Palmetto.

 “We weren’t actively looking to open a business but Perspire made such an impact on us personally that we knew we had to be part of it,” said Mike. “The benefits speak for themselves, and we’re excited to introduce this experience to more people starting with our very first studio right here in Bradenton, where we hope to help others feel better, take care of themselves, and find a place to truly recharge.”

 The 2,165-square-foot studio features ten private infrared sauna suites, five SNØ Showers, and the premium hospitality and wellness services that have made Perspire a leader in the category nationwide.

 Bradenton-area residents can look forward to visiting the new Perspire Sauna Studio to learn about and experience the benefits of infrared saunas and red-light therapy firsthand. The franchise is intent on giving members an immersive infrared sauna experience through use of the latest in red-light therapy technology, providing concierge-level service and premium amenities to ensure a transformative sauna session.
