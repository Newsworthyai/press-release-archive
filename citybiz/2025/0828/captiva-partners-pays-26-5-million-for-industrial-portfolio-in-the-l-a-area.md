# Captiva Partners Pays $26.5 Million for Industrial Portfolio in the L.A. Area

Confirming investment demand for small bay industrial properties in the Los Angeles area, Lee & Associates, the largest broker-owned commercial real estate firm in North America, announced today that its LA North/Ventura office has brokered the sale of a six-building industrial portfolio totaling approximately 107,000 square feet on 8.6 acres in Calabasas, California to Captiva Partners for $26.5 million.

 The portfolio consists of three separate projects with a total of 47 suites ranging in size from approximately 1,300 to 5,200 square feet, located at 23907–23947 Ventura Boulevard, 23930–23978 Craftsman Road, 5101–5111 and 5115 Douglas Fir Road, and 23961 Craftsman Road in Calabasas. Each building features functional layouts with rear bay loading doors and strong freeway access.

 The Lee & Associates LA North/Ventura team of Principal Scott Caswell and Principal/Managing Director Erica Balin, represented the seller, Calabasas Investment Group and Craftsman Investment Group, as well as the buyer.

 “This well-maintained multi-tenant Industrial portfolio is the largest concentration of smaller space available in the Calabasas area offering very stable tenancy and future growth opportunity,” said Caswell.

 “Captiva Partners is excited to expand our portfolio with this acquisition,” said Brian Abers, Managing Partner of Captiva Partners. “We plan to invest in strategic upgrades to the buildings and continue providing high-quality space tailored to the needs of local businesses.”

 Balin went on to say “The successful sale of this industrial portfolio speaks volumes about the current state of industrial investment—locally, regionally, and nationally. We experienced strong interest from a wide array of buyers, reflecting a clear and sustained appetite for quality small-bay, multi-tenant industrial assets. The depth and diversity of interest highlight a market that remains competitive and optimistic about the future of this asset class.”

 This portfolio is ideally located just minutes from the US 101 Freeway, providing convenient access to neighboring communities.
