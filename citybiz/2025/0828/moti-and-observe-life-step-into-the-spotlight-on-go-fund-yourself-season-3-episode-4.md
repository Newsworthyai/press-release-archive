# MOTI and Observe Life Step Into the Spotlight on Go Fund Yourself Season 3, Episode 4

The entrepreneurial spotlight returns this week as Go Fund Yourself Season 3 continues its momentum with Episode 4, airing Thursday, August 28 at 7 PM ET on Cheddar TV. The show, which blends high-stakes business pitches with investor-driven insights, once again places founders face-to-face with a formidable panel of Titans: Rory Cutaia, David Meltzer, and Jayson Waller.

 This episode features two ventures at the intersection of business, technology, and human behavior: MOTI, a pro-focused video chat app turning conversations into revenue, and Observe Life, a privacy-first platform redefining digital memory preservation. Both companies represent fast-emerging sectors where monetization models and data ownership are undergoing rapid change.

 

 MOTI: Monetizing the “Time-is-Money” Economy

 Founded by Hugo, MOTI rethinks how professionals get compensated for their expertise. The app allows coaches, consultants, mentors, and creators to host video calls on-demand or by appointment, with instant in-app payments on a per-minute basis. Unlike traditional models relying on invoices, subscriptions, or delayed transfers, MOTI prioritizes seamless, transaction-first monetization.

 By positioning itself as the “Uber for knowledge,” MOTI addresses inefficiencies in the creator and expertise economy, where demand is strong but revenue capture is often fragmented. For investors, the attraction lies in MOTI’s potential to scale marketplace take-rates and create a standardized layer for professional-to-consumer video interactions.

 The Titans are expected to press on competitive differentiation against incumbents like Zoom, Calendly, and Patreon. Yet MOTI’s narrow focus on instant monetization gives it an opportunity to carve out a distinct position in a growing $100-billion-plus knowledge economy.

 Observe Life: Building Digital Legacies with Privacy at the Core

 Observe Life, led by founder Brandon Beard, enters the pitch stage with a bold proposition: what if memories and family legacies were built and owned outside of social media’s data economy?

 The company’s platform enables families and institutions to collaborate on secure timelines, capture daily prompts, and construct multi-generational digital storylines. Starting at $3.99 per month, its subscription model balances affordability for families with scalable licensing opportunities for institutional partners.

 What sets Observe Life apart for investors is its dual revenue approach. Beyond consumer subscriptions, the company is targeting licensing agreements with weddings, retirement communities, and event venues. This positions Observe Life not just as a memory-sharing tool, but as an end-to-end digital keepsake solution for significant life events.

 With successor permissions, private ownership features, and emphasis on data security, Observe Life directly addresses growing consumer concerns around privacy and permanence. The challenge—and opportunity—will be competing for market share in a space dominated by tech giants like Facebook and Google Photos.

 Why Investors Should Pay Attention

 The juxtaposition of MOTI and Observe Life underscores the broader narrative of this season of Go Fund Yourself: founders are tackling universal needs with focused, scalable solutions. MOTI speaks to monetizing professional time in real-time, while Observe Life taps into preserving personal history without compromising privacy.

 For investors and industry watchers, Episode 4 offers insight into two distinct but equally relevant markets—one addressing the economics of the present, the other safeguarding legacies for the future.

 As always, the Titans’ questions and critiques will push both founders to sharpen their models, clarify competitive edges, and demonstrate investor-ready growth strategies.
