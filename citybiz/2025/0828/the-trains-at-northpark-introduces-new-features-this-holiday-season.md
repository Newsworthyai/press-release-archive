# The Trains at NorthPark Introduces New Features This Holiday Season

The signature fundraiser returns for its 38th year to benefit the Ronald McDonald House of Dallas

 The Ronald McDonald House of Dallas (RMHD) is proud to host its 38th annual Trains at NorthPark, located on level one of NorthPark Center. The signature fundraiser and holiday tradition supports families from across Texas, the U.S., and around the world who travel to Dallas for critical medical care for their children and teens. Co-Chaired by Vanessa Fuquay and Elizabeth Anderson, this year’s event introduces several new features designed to enrich the visitor experience.

 One of the highlights is Art on the Rails (AOTR), an all-new auction component where fine art and train enthusiasts can bid on a stunning four-car train set, hand-painted by renowned reflectionist artist and Samuel Lynne Galleries owner, JD Miller.

 “I’m honored to be part of The Trains at NorthPark,” said Miller. “It’s a meaningful tradition that brings joy to so many. I’m proud to contribute through my art to an event that supports Ronald McDonald House of Dallas and the families it serves throughout DFW and beyond.”

 Another exciting addition is Choo-Choo Tales, the inaugural theatrical story-time experience featuring weekly live performances in NorthCourt. This interactive element is being produced in collaboration with Dallas Children’s Theater and Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts. The short play, written by recent Booker T. graduate Esau Price, will be directed by DCT Artistic Director, Emily Ernst.

 This year’s Sensory Hours, presented by Children’s Health, will take place Wednesdays from 6–8 p.m. and Sundays from 12–2 p.m., providing a welcoming environment for guests with sensory sensitivities.

 Presented by Bank of Texas for the 17th consecutive year, The Trains at NorthPark will return on Saturday, November 15, 2025, and run for eight weeks through Sunday, January 4, 2026. The 2025 season of The Trains aims to raise more than $1.1 million to help provide a home-away-from-home for families with sick children at no charge to them.

 “We are proud to welcome families back to the Trains at NorthPark,” said Jill Cumnock, CEO of RMHD. “This year, we’ve introduced exciting new features designed to make the experience event more interactive and accessible for all guests. Thanks to our incredible sponsors and help from the community, the magic of trains continues to bring joy and comfort during the holiday season.”
