# Highway Launches the Trusted Freight Exchange, Powered by the Triumph Network

The Industry’s First Secure Digital Freight Exchange for Verified Freight

 Highway, the leader in Carrier Identity® and compliance solutions, today announced the official launch of the Trusted Freight Exchange (TFX), the first secure digital freight exchange built exclusively for verified carriers and vetted brokers.

 At the core of TFX is Highway’s identity engine and powered by Triumph’s market rating, intelligence, payment, and credit capabilities. Together, they embed identity verification, compliance, pricing, and payments in a single platform. The result is a new era of trust, control, and speed for modern freight transactions.

 Unlike traditional load boards that create noise, inefficiency, and exposure to fraud, TFX delivers a purpose-built ecosystem where:

 * Brokers gain direct access to identity-verified, ELD-connected carriers.
* Carriers access legitimate freight from trusted brokers with no spam, no uncertainty, and no hidden fees.
* Every transaction is backed by real-time fraud checks, verified rate intelligence, broker credit assurance, and secure financial settlement.

 “From the beginning, our goal was simple: build a secure, transparent platform to move freight,” said Jordan Graft, Founder & CEO of Highway. “TFX delivers on that promise, powered by verified identity, assured payment, and a trusted network.”

 By addressing the industry’s most pressing challenges — impersonation, double brokering, fraud, non-payment, and poor visibility — TFX creates a foundation brokers and carriers can trust for every transaction.

 “We’re eliminating the fraud and fragmentation of traditional load boards and creating a digital freight exchange defined by trust,” said Jordan Graft. “This is freight the way it should be.”

 The launch of TFX marks a milestone for the freight industry, introducing a new standard of identity-first infrastructure for moving freight with confidence.
