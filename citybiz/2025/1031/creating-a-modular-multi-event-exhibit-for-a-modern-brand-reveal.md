# Creating a Modular, Multi-Event Exhibit for a Modern Brand Reveal

When Element Fleet Management sought a dynamic and versatile exhibit solution for its trade show presence, Adler Display stepped in to deliver a custom-designed 20×20 exhibit that could seamlessly reconfigure into 10×20 and 10×10 booth formats. The goal was to create a visually striking, highly functional space that elevated Element Fleet’s refreshed brand while offering adaptability across multiple event footprints.

 The Challenge

 Undergoing a major brand refresh, Element Fleet viewed its upcoming trade show schedule as the perfect platform to unveil its new visual identity. The company needed a modular exhibit system that could present a cohesive brand experience, whether set up as a 20×20 island or scaled down to 10×20 and 10×10 inline formats.

 * Maximizing brand visibility across different booth sizes
* An open floor plan in the 20×20 with two distinct seating areas, integrating technology for video demonstrations
* Maintaining a clean, modern aesthetic that reflected the rebrand

 Key Features Include:

 * 12′ Diameter Overhead Hanging Sign: Two-sided graphics ensure visibility from every angle.

* 36″ Bistro-Height Wireless Charging Table:Custom-branded tabletop with adjustable LED perimeter halo lighting for a modern touch.
* Curved Reception Counter:Recessed LED perimeter lighting, internal shelving, and locking doors combine style and practicality.
* Faux Wood Flooring: Adds warmth and sophistication to the overall environment.

 Comprehensive Project Support

 Beyond design and fabrication, Adler Display provided turnkey project management, including:

 * Exhibit property storage and maintenance
* Online inventory system for easy tracking
* Complete logistics and vendor coordination

 This comprehensive approach ensured seamless event execution, allowing Element Fleet’s team to stay focused on engaging prospects and clients, rather than managing booth logistics.

 The Impact

The combination of bold visuals, interactive technology, and thoughtful design positions the company to stand out and connect meaningfully with its audience.
