# Rotary Club of Boca Raton Sunrise Tees Up for 38th Annual Golf Tournament

The Rotary Club of Boca Raton Sunrise is gearing up for its 38th Annual Golf Tournament, happening Monday, November 10, 2025, at Boca Grove Country Club. Participants can look forward to an exciting morning of golf, camaraderie, and charitable giving — all in support of local education.

 “We’re especially thrilled about this year’s tournament being held at Boca Grove — a new and prestigious course for us that’s generating a lot of buzz,” said Dr. Steve Alman, Chairman. “Between the world-class setting, exciting silent auction, and the incredible generosity of our sponsors and golfers, we know this will be one of our most impactful and memorable tournaments yet.”

 This signature event brings together local businesses, community leaders, and golf enthusiasts for a day on the green — benefitting both the Rotary Club of Boca Raton Sunrise Foundation and the Boca Raton Chamber of Commerce’s Golden Bell Education Foundation.

 This year, the club is proud to honor Chuck Stout, Chair of the Golden Bell Education Foundation, whose leadership and dedication have made a lasting impact on education and youth development throughout the Boca Raton community. Chuck will be recognized for his outstanding service and commitment to supporting local schools and students.

 “Chuck exemplifies the Rotary spirit of ‘Service Above Self,’ and we are proud to celebrate his incredible contributions to Golden Bell and to education in Boca Raton,” Alman added.
