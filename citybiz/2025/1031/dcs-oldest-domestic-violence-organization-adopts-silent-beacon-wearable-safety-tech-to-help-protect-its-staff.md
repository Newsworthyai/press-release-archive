# DC’s Oldest Domestic Violence Organization Adopts Silent Beacon Wearable Safety Tech to Help Protect Its Staff

In a powerful blend of compassion and innovation, D.C.’s oldest domestic violence organization, My Sister’s Place, is taking a bold step to safeguard its team and the survivors they serve. The nonprofit has partnered with Maryland-based Silent Beacon to equip its staff with wearable safety devices that can call 911 and share their live GPS location, all at the touch of a button.

 The partnership marks a local collaboration between two mission-driven organizations working on the frontlines of safety and support. For the staff at My Sister’s Place, who often work in shelters, conduct home visits, and engage in community outreach, the device offers not only protection but also peace of mind.

 “At My Sister’s Place, our staff works with survivors of domestic violence every day; in shelters, in the community, and often in challenging or high-risk situations,” said Krista McDaniel, Interim Executive Director of My Sister’s Place. “It’s critical that our team can reach help the moment a problem arises, because every second matters in an emergency. Silent Beacon’s wearable panic button provides a simple, discreet way to alert emergency contacts or 911, giving our team greater peace of mind as they carry out this vital work.”

 The Silent Beacon device stands out for its “Silent Mode”, allowing users to send an alert without making a sound, preventing an abuser or attacker from realizing help has been summoned.

 “Safety is at the core of everything we do,” McDaniel added. “My Sister’s Place empowers survivors to take back control of their lives, and this partnership with Silent Beacon reflects that same value for our staff. Equipping our team with Silent Beacon’s panic button devices demonstrates the same philosophy we teach survivors: that safety and autonomy matter. It’s about leading by example and creating a culture of protection, empowerment, and care.”

 

 The timing is urgent. Domestic violence remains a national crisis affecting 1 in 3 women and 1 in 7 men in the U.S. According to national data, 24 people per minute experience rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner, which adds up to more than 12 million people each year. While most violent crime rates are falling, domestic violence incidents have risen 3% in the first half of the year, underscoring the need for innovative safety measures.

 “After equipping our staff with Silent Beacon, they’ve said they feel more confident conducting home visits, outreach, and community work with survivors of domestic violence,” said McDaniel. “Knowing they have a discreet, reliable way to reach help allows them to focus fully on supporting survivors, rather than worrying about their own safety. That added peace of mind makes a real difference in how effectively we can do our jobs.”

 

 Founded by entrepreneur Kenny Kelley, Silent Beacon was born from personal experience. After surviving a near-fatal motorcycle crash that left him unable to call for help, Kelley set out to develop a wearable device that could connect users to emergency assistance with the press of a button. The technology is now being used across industries, from healthcare, education, government, and construction to nonprofits like My Sister’s Place, to help protect workers and individuals in vulnerable or isolated environments.

 “Technology has the power to save lives, but only if it’s simple enough to use in an emergency,” said Kenny Kelley, Founder and CEO of Silent Beacon. “We designed Silent Beacon to help people feel safer and more connected, whether they’re a survivor, a social worker, or someone walking to their car late at night. Partnering with My Sister’s Place means our technology can help protect the very people who dedicate their lives to protecting others, and that’s exactly what our mission is about.”

 McDaniel hopes this partnership will inspire other social service organizations to follow suit. “We hope this sends a clear message to other organizations that prioritizing staff safety is essential,” she said. “Frontline staff are often the first to respond in moments of crisis, and their safety should always be a top concern. By investing in technology like Silent Beacon, we’re showing that caring for those who work directly with survivors is central to our mission, and that innovation can play a vital role in enhancing safety and supporting efforts to combat domestic violence.”

 Together, My Sister’s Place and Silent Beacon are proving that safety isn’t just a mission statement, it’s a practice. Their collaboration offers a model for how technology and advocacy can intersect to protect those who protect others.
