# Hi Auto Appoints Crystal Deaderick as Head of Sales

Hi Auto, a global leader in AI-powered voice ordering for drive-thrus, has announced the appointment of Crystal Deaderick as Head of Sales, signaling a new stage of expansion for the fast-growing company. The announcement, made on October 27, 2025, highlights Hi Auto’s continued commitment to helping quick-service restaurants (QSRs) achieve faster, more accurate, and more consistent service through automation.

 Deaderick brings more than 20 years of combined experience in restaurant operations and technology sales. Her deep understanding of both the front lines of restaurant service and the technical solutions that power efficiency makes her an ideal fit for Hi Auto’s next phase of growth.

 Crystal Deaderick’s Restaurant Background Shapes Her Leadership

 Before entering the tech world, Crystal Deaderick worked in restaurants for more than a decade, beginning at age 14 and continuing through college and early adulthood. This early exposure gave her firsthand insight into the daily challenges faced by restaurant teams, from managing high-volume service to ensuring customer satisfaction.

 Her time in restaurant operations later evolved into a successful career in technology sales. Deaderick held senior positions at Dragonfruit AI, Qu POS, and Revel Systems, where she consistently exceeded performance targets and led teams to close multi-million-dollar technology deals. Her combined background gives her a unique ability to understand the needs of restaurant operators and translate those needs into actionable technology solutions.

 Her leadership approach is rooted in helping restaurants run smarter and improve both customer and employee experiences. By aligning practical solutions with operational realities, she focuses on driving measurable results that benefit both franchise owners and their staff.

 Hi Auto Expands Its AI Order-Taking Platform Across the QSR Industry

 Hi Auto’s appointment of Deaderick comes at a pivotal time for the company. The company’s AI order-taking platform has rapidly expanded, serving nearly 1,000 drive-thru locations with a 93 percent order completion rate and 96 percent accuracy.

 These achievements demonstrate Hi Auto’s ability to deliver reliable, scalable technology to QSRs that demand high performance. The company’s AI voice system helps restaurants process orders faster and more accurately, reducing staff workload while improving customer satisfaction. By centralizing control over voice scripts and upselling prompts while allowing local flexibility, Hi Auto ensures that restaurants maintain both consistency and adaptability.

 Hi Auto’s leadership expressed that Deaderick’s appointment strengthens the company’s ability to build lasting partnerships with global QSR brands. Her proven track record in sales leadership and her operational understanding will play a crucial role in helping the company reach new markets and expand its presence among franchise operators.

 Growing Demand for AI Voice Ordering in Quick-Service Restaurants

 Automation is reshaping the quick-service restaurant industry, and AI-powered voice ordering is at the center of that transformation. According to Restroworks, drive-thrus account for more than 75 percent of all fast-food sales in the United States. The combination of labor shortages and customer demand for faster service has made AI adoption a key priority for major restaurant chains.

 Hi Auto’s 2025 Buyer’s Guide for QSRs identifies the core performance standards for AI drive-thru systems: a minimum of 90 percent order completion and 95 percent accuracy for commercial viability. Hi Auto exceeds these metrics, establishing itself as one of the most dependable and scalable AI solutions in the market.

 For restaurant owners, the benefits of automation are clear. AI systems reduce human error, improve upselling opportunities, and maintain consistent service quality. At the same time, employees can focus on other high-value tasks that enhance customer experience.

 Hi Auto’s Future Under Crystal Deaderick’s Strategic Sales Leadership

 As Hi Auto expands, one of its biggest challenges will be maintaining performance across diverse markets and franchise models. Scaling from hundreds to thousands of locations introduces variables such as background noise, regional accents, and unique menu configurations.

 Deaderick’s leadership will be central to addressing these challenges. Her operational background allows her to anticipate the concerns of QSR operators, while her experience in enterprise sales ensures she can deliver solutions that align with business goals. She will focus on building long-term partnerships and driving adoption across major franchise networks.

 Hi Auto’s strategy under Deaderick’s guidance is focused on sustained growth, customer success, and continued innovation in AI-driven voice ordering. The company’s mission to redefine drive-thru performance aligns perfectly with her vision of helping restaurants achieve measurable operational gains through technology.

 With proven results, strong industry momentum, and experienced leadership, Hi Auto is positioned to shape the future of how quick-service restaurants operate. The addition of Crystal Deaderick marks a strategic step toward that future, reinforcing the company’s commitment to smarter, faster, and more reliable service through AI innovation.
