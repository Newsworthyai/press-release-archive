# The Mall at Wellington Green Honors Local Veterans with Honor Wall and Tree of Joy

Community events celebrate and support Palm Beach County veterans and their families

 The Mall at Wellington Green, in partnership with Stand Down, a local nonprofit dedicated to supporting Palm Beach County veterans and their families in the fight against homelessness, will host two special community initiatives honoring local veterans this November and December.

 Honor Wall and Veterans Day Ceremony November 1–8

 City Furniture Court From November 1 through November 8, The Mall at Wellington Green will dedicate an Honor Wall in the City Furniture Court. Shoppers are invited to post an American Flag honoring a veteran or active military member, with the goal of watching the wall visually grow throughout the week.

 The commemoration will culminate in a Veterans Day Ceremony on Saturday, November 8, at 11 a.m. The event will feature The Palm Beach Lakes Community High School Ram Regiment Band performing The Star-Spangled Banner and America the Beautiful, the posting of the colors, the Pledge of Allegiance, and remarks from a veteran guest speaker. Light refreshments will be served.

 Tree of Joy November 1–December 10

 Grand Court The Mall at Wellington Green and Stand Down will also host the Tree of Joy, a charitable holiday tradition designed to bring warmth and joy to local veteran families in need.

 Located in the Grand Court, the Tree of Joy will display tags listing the names, ages, sizes, and holiday wishes of children from veteran families across Palm Beach County. Shoppers are encouraged to select a tag, purchase a gift, and drop off their donations at Starbucks by December 10. Each contribution helps ensure that every veteran family experiences a brighter holiday season.

 “The Mall at Wellington Green is proud to honor our local heroes and give back to the families who have bravely served our country,” said Asad Sadiq, General Manager of The Mall at Wellington Green. “Through partnerships like Stand Down, we can create meaningful experiences that celebrate gratitude, generosity, and community.”

 The Mall at Wellington Green is located at 10300 Forest Hill Blvd., Wellington. For more information, call (561) 227-6900 or visit shopwellingtongreen.com.
