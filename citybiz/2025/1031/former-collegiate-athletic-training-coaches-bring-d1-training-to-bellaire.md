# Former Collegiate Athletic Training Coaches Bring D1 Training to Bellaire

D1 Training, a leading fitness enrichment concept utilizing the five core tenets of athletic-based training, recently opened a new location in Bellaire at 5300 N. Braeswood Blvd, Suite 44. The new group fitness facility employs a sports-science backed training regimen led by certified trainers to help people of all ages achieve their sport and fitness goals.

 Hans and Jen Straub have joined a roster of impressive existing franchisees, including former professional and collegiate athletes. Additional D1 partners include NBA star Chris Paul and Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow.

 Hans brings over 20 years of collegiate strength and conditioning experience to his role. His career includes coaching stints at the University of San Diego, the University of Washington, and Stanford University, where he served as the top assistant Sports Performance coach for football and later as Director of Olympic Sports Performance, overseeing training for baseball, women’s swimming, and women’s gymnastics. He also worked at the University of South Florida before joining Rice University, where he was the head of strength and conditioning for the past seven years.

 Throughout his career, Hans has trained 65 NFL players, including six first-round picks like Houston’s Andrew Luck, who played at Stratford High School. He has also worked with 50 professional baseball players, including five first-round picks, and 10 Olympians, one of whom is gold medalist Simone Manuel, a graduate of Steven F. Austin High School.

 Jen brings valuable experience in the health and fitness space, having worked as an athletic trainer at Stanford for five years as well as two years at the University of Oklahoma. After relocating to South Florida, she transitioned to a clinical setting, taking on a managerial role. Her professional background spans primary care, orthopedics, and fertility.

 “We were drawn to D1 because it truly operates like a family,” said Jen. “With our new location, we will help youth athletes grow, develop, and reach their full potential. Whether they aspire to earn scholarships or simply want to improve, we’re excited to support these young athletes in achieving their goals.”

 D1 Training offers four age-based programs including Rookie (ages 7-11), Developmental (ages 12-14), Prep (ages 15-18) and D1 Adult. Each fitness program is based on the five athletic-based tenets: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down. Outside of group workouts, D1 Training offers group, semi-private, and one-on-one training with world-class coaches. The goal is simple: to continue to train athletes who are dedicated to their sport or fitness goals, regardless of age, or athletic background.

 Strategically expanding across the nation through franchising, D1 Training has more than 150 facilities open with over 100 additional locations in various stages of development. The brand is currently seeking financially qualified business builders, former athletes, and entrepreneurs, who share a passion for fitness and youth sports, who are ready to make a positive impact on their community.
