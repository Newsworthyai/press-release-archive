# Priority Capital Advisory Arranges $31.3 Million Loan for the Development of a 116-Unit, Affordable Housing Project in Los Angeles

Zachary Streit, Founder and President of Priority Capital Advisory, has arranged a $31.3 million loan on behalf of Six Peak Capital, a Los Angeles-based developer and investment firm. The senior debt financing is for the development of a 116-unit 100% affordable housing project located at 9033 Ramsgate in the Westchester neighborhood of Los Angeles.

 9033 Ramsgate is a Los Angeles Executive Directive 1 (ED1) project. ED1 projects enable developers to utilize California’s State Density Bonus Law to entitle affordable housing, offering substantial incentives such as increased density, building height, reduced parking requirements and accelerated review and permitting processes for 100% affordable projects.

 “Since this was an ED1 project, Priority Capital Advisory needed to identify a lender who was comfortable with some of the nuances of getting an ED1 project financed, including a significant property tax abatement and a limited parking ratio,” said Streit. “Despite these distinctions and some of the headwinds facing development in Los Angeles, this loan request attracted a significant number of bidders and we were able to deliver a successful and smooth closing.”

 The property will include a unit mix designed to attract both individuals and families, comprising 15 studios (13%), 31 one-bedroom/one-bathroom units (27%), and 70 two-bedroom/one-bathroom units (60%). All units will be fully furnished, offering tenants a seamless, move-in-ready living experience.

 Situated on a one-half acre site, the property is convenient to the 405 Freeway and sits adjacent to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), a major employment hub with roughly 59,000 workers and is a 10-minute drive from another massive employment and entertainment hub – Hollywood Park – a 300-acre mixed-use development that includes major venues such as SoFi Stadium, Kia Forum, Intuit Dome, and YouTube Theater. The property aims to provide the local workforce with a high-quality yet affordable housing option.

 “This loan and groundbreaking reflect Six Peak Capital’s continued expansion into the development of covenanted affordable housing in California,” said Chris Aiello, Partner with Six Peak Capital. “Our focus is on creating sustainable communities that meet the urgent demand for affordable housing, while building lasting partnerships across the state. As we continue to scale our affordable housing portfolio, our firm is actively seeking partnerships with landowners across California to deploy its innovative housing strategies and deliver long-term affordability.”

 With this loan in place, the project has now broken ground with completion anticipated for late 2027. Construction will be led by LV Construction LLC, Six Peak Capital’s affiliated construction company.
