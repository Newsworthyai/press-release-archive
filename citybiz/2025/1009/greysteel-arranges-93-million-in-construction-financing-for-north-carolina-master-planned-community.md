# Greysteel Arranges $93 Million in Construction Financing for North Carolina Master-Planned Community

Greysteel, a leading national commercial real estate and capital markets services firm, has arranged an approximately $93 million senior construction loan on behalf of a developer for horizontal infrastructure for a large-scale, master-planned residential community in Brunswick County, North Carolina. The project is set to deliver over 2,000 single-family lots, with five national and regional homebuilders already under contract for lot takedowns.

 The transaction was led by Greysteel Associate Landen Nix, with support from Greysteel Senior Director Daniel Hartnett, who worked with a New York-based lender to secure the financing. The complex deal involved refinancing a challenged legacy capital stack and upsizing the loan to accommodate the conversion and sale of paper lots during the development process. The final financing represents approximately 81% of the project cost.

 Greysteel navigated a competitive market by leveraging its deep relationships with a curated group of 10 to 15 qualified land development lenders, quickly sourcing multiple competitive term sheets. The team’s strategic guidance allowed the client to prioritize this time-sensitive transaction while structuring a flexible loan that met the project’s evolving needs. The successful execution highlights continued lender confidence in well-structured development projects with strong sponsorship.

 “In a capital markets environment defined by higher rates and lender selectivity, securing flexible financing for horizontal infrastructure is paramount. This transaction required a forward-thinking partner, and the lender delivered with certainty of execution. Their ability to upsize the loan and structure terms around future lot sales was instrumental in recapitalizing the project and unlocking its next phase,” said Nix, who marks the first closing of his career with this landmark deal.

 “I am grateful for the trust placed in us by the developer and lender,” he added. “This outcome is a testament to our firm’s collaborative platform and the power of persistence.”
