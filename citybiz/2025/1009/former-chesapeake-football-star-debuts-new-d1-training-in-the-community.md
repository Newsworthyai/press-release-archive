# Former Chesapeake Football Star Debuts New D1 Training in the Community

D1 Training, a leading fitness enrichment concept utilizing the five core tenets of athletic-based training, recently opened new location in East Chesapeake at 1011 Eden Way North on July 14. The new group fitness facility employs a sports-science backed training regimen led by certified trainers to help people of all ages achieve their sport and fitness goals.

 Marvin Brown will join a roster of impressive existing franchisees, including professional athletes like Kylie Fitts and Jordan Gay. Additional D1 partners include NBA star Chris Paul and Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow.

 Marvin attended Hickory High School before playing tight end at James Madison University from 2003 to 2008, where he was part of the 2004 national championship team and will be inducted into JMU’s Athletic Hall of Fame in 2024. Athletics run in the family, his father is a former professional baseball player with World Series appearances for the New York Yankees and San Diego Padres, and his sister Bonita is an Atlantic City High School Hall of Famer in basketball, softball, and tennis. Marvin has been coaching alongside his brother Donnell Brown, head football coach at Hickory High School. Donnell and his twin brother Ronnell, who played at JMU and went on to the NFL (Denver Broncos) and CFL (Hamilton Tiger-Cats), have long shared a passion for sports.

 After a 15-year career in healthcare leadership, Marvin sought to pursue his passions for athletics and family, which led him to D1 Training. He and his wife Ardaith have three children who are eager to help build a strong community around D1 Training East Chesapeake. Marvin and Donnell are partnering with longtime friend and Hickory High teammate Leland Cleland, who will open a second location in West Chesapeake in late 2025 or early 2026. Together, they’ll operate under one brand: ‘D1 Chesapeake’.

 “D1 stands out because it’s more than just a gym, it’s a training ground that builds character, discipline, and confidence,” said Brown. “D1 Training is known as “The Place of Athlete” but we want D1 Chesapeake to be known as the Home of the Athlete where they can grow physically, mentally, and spiritually.”

 D1 Training offers four age-based programs including Rookie (ages 7-11), Developmental (ages 12-14), Prep (ages 15-18) and D1 Adult. Each fitness program is based on the five athletic-based tenets: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down. Outside of group workouts, D1 Training offers group, semi-private, and one-on-one training with world-class coaches. The goal is simple: to continue to train athletes who are dedicated to their sport or fitness goals, regardless of age, or athletic background.

 “The Browns and Clelland are the ideal candidates to bring the D1 Training experience to Chesapeake,” said the brand’s Chief Operating Officer, Dan Murphy. “We’re thrilled to welcome them to the D1 family and are confident in their ability to show the East Chesapeake area what they’ve been missing out on. D1 is a one-of-a-kind fitness experience that’s built around the individual and meant to help people meet their athletic goals. Our strong network of franchisees embodies our core values to bring the D1 Training vision to life, and we know they will do just that in Chesapeake and its surrounding communities.”

 Strategically expanding across the nation through franchising, D1 Training has more than 150 facilities open with over 100 additional locations in various stages of development. The brand is currently seeking financially qualified business builders, former athletes, and entrepreneurs, who share a passion for fitness and youth sports, who are ready to make a positive impact on their community.
