# Q&amp;A with Siobhan Shaw, Founder of Cancer Bites &amp; Growing to Give

Siobhan Shaw is a nonprofit leader, storyteller, and patient advocate using the power of community and conversation to spark change.

 She is the co-founder of Growing to Give (G2G), home to the largest food forest in the nation, where she writes and speaks frequently on gardening, sustainability, and food justice. G2G’s model proves that yes, food really does grow on trees—and that communities can grow resilience along with nourishment.

 Building on that foundation of advocacy, Siobhan is also the founder of Cancer Bites, a podcast and community redefining how we talk about metastatic breast cancer. With candid, unfiltered conversations—sometimes raw, sometimes funny—Cancer Bites is quickly becoming a gathering place for patients, caregivers, and advocates who crave honesty and connection while navigating one of life’s toughest diagnoses.

 While her published work to date has largely focused on gardening and food systems, Siobhan’s next chapter is aimed squarely at cancer awareness, inspired healing, patient advocacy, and mental health—and Cancer Bites is poised to eclipse everything before it.

 With honesty, grit, and a dash of humor, Siobhan brings humanity to the hard stuff—because resilience is serious work, but it doesn’t always have to sound that way.

 Can you share your cancer story and how you’re doing today?

 In June 2025, I heard the words no one ever wants to hear: “You have stage four metastatic breast cancer. You have six years to live.” I like to say cancer bit me first—but I bit back.

 It’s got a good hold on me, spreading through my bones, and the scariest part so far was when my lung began filling with fluid as the cancer ate through the pleura lining. I was rushed to the ER with severe shortness of breath—and that’s when they found the cancer. My amazing medical team jumped on it. After a good 4 liters removed in hospital and 16 weekly thoracenteses (that’s where they stab me in the back and drain the fluid—fun, right?), I’m now down to check-ins every three weeks. Progress!

 Right now, I’m on chemo pills and estrogen blockers—no IVs, no hair loss… bonus! Though honestly, I’d still love to get my hair and nails done one of these days. To feel feminine and fierce once again.

 Living with stage four means there’s no “cure,” but there is life, laughter, and purpose. Some days are surprisingly easy, others are tough, and some are downright brutal—like the recent bout of high anxiety I’ve been working through. But I’ve learned that gratitude is a muscle, and I work it out daily.

 I’ve also got the best cancer coach and partner in the world—John Kendall, a 23-year cancer survivor himself. The first day I got out of the hospital, I could barely function, let alone walk. John got me up and moving—at the grocery store, of all places! He grabbed a cart for me to hold on to, and we made one slow loop around the outer aisles. Since then, we walk every day—three miles, still in that same store. My scans are showing improvement, and my energy shot off the charts the day I decided to create Cancer Bites.

 Tell us about Growing to Give.

 Growing to Give is our nonprofit focused on community food security—and just to clear things up, we’re not the farm in Maine! We love them, but we’re based in Washington State and sunny Arizona, and we’re growing everywhere else—from the desert to the neighborhoods that need it most. We started small in 2020—well, technically our registration came through on December 24, 2019 (a little divine timing if you ask me), just months before the world shut down. We literally started with seeds sprouting in spirals, and that first year, we grew 100,000 pounds of food for the community.

 Today, we’re growing produce, partnerships, and purpose across Phoenix, the nation, and beyond. Our Phoenix Food Forest Initiative, led by visionary and Navy veteran Christopher Macy, brings neighbors together to plant, harvest, and share fresh food right where it’s needed most. It’s about turning empty sidewalks and lots into living legacies—and proving that when a community grows together, everyone eats.

 Can you share what inspired Cancer Bites

 Cancer Bites was born out of my need to turn pain into power—and to laugh through the chaos that cancer brings. One day last September, I got this sudden download to create it. I didn’t overthink it; I just sat down, opened my desktop, and started a Facebook page.

 From there, it became a podcast and a movement for anyone touched by cancer who’s tired of the same sad soundtrack.

 We talk about the real stuff: treatment, identity, hope, dark humor, and the weird things people say when they don’t know what to say. It’s raw, funny, sometimes messy—but always real. Because cancer does bite—but we bite back harder.

 I also vlog about my personal journey to help others feel seen, not singled out.

 What else can we expect from Cancer Bites?

 We’re just getting started! We’re expanding into live conversations, collaborations, and bite-sized video series that mix storytelling with survivorship, advocacy, and laughter therapy. Expect more guest voices—from patients to caregivers to medical pros—talking honestly about what it means to live with cancer, not just fight it.

 You’ll also see more of my personal journey, with a dose of inspiration and attempts at humor. Think of it as equal parts therapy session, comedy hour, and love letter to resilience.

 How can we listen to the show and get involved with your organization?

 You can find Cancer Bites on the Growing to Give YouTube channel at youtube.com/@growingtogive/podcasts and join our Facebook page at facebook.com/cancerbitespodcast.

 Follow us on social media for new episodes, events, and ways to connect. You’ll also find my gardening tips podcast inspired by the many publications I contribute to—Homes & Gardens, The Spruce, Success Magazine, and Bob Vila.

 To get your hands dirty (literally), volunteer or donate at GrowingtoGive.org.

 And if you want to help us grow Cancer Bites, we’ve got a “Titty Committee” (yes, that’s the real name!) of helpers we’re building—everything from social media, show production, to design and merch. We’re also seeking sponsors for both our community gardens, food forests, and our Cancer Bites gift bag campaign—launching this holiday season to deliver joy and swag to breast cancer patients and beyond.

 Every dollar, every seed, and every act of kindness helps grow hope where it’s needed most.

 Anything else to add?

 Yes—hope is contagious. Spread it.
