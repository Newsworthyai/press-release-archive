# Former College Athlete Opens D1 Training in Clearwater, Bringing Elite Athletic Fitness to the Community

D1 Training, a leading fitness enrichment concept utilizing the five core tenets of athletic-based training, will be opening a new location in Clearwater at 2265 Gulf to Bay Blvd on October 13. The new group fitness facility employs a sports-science backed training regimen led by certified trainers to help people of all ages achieve their sport and fitness goals.

 St. Petersburg native Jeff Ritch and his wife Lauren join a roster of impressive existing franchisees, including former professional and collegiate athletes. Additional D1 partners include NBA star Chris Paul and Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow.

 Both born-and-raised Floridians, Jeff and Lauren are thrilled to be bringing a business they believe into their home community. Jeff, a fourth generation St. Petersburg financial advisor, and Lauren, a pharmaceutical representative by trade, look forward to combining their financial and customer service expertise to run a business together. As a former collegiate football player at University of Richmond, Jeff resonates with D1 Training for its mission to help athletes take the next step in their athletic careers. He knows what it takes to be a college athlete and wants to ensure all athletes in the area get the attention and training they need to succeed.

 “There was nothing like this for me growing up, and if there was, I would have felt much more prepared for college football,” said Jeff Ritch. “Being able to prep kids and show them what it takes to be a D1 athlete, while also having fun and promoting teamwork, is something that I am looking forward to.”

 D1 Training offers four age-based programs including Rookie (ages 7-11), Developmental (ages 12-14), Prep (ages 15-18) and D1 Adult. Each fitness program is based on the five athletic-based tenets: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down. Outside of group workouts, D1 Training offers group, semi-private, and one-on-one training with world-class coaches. The goal is simple: to continue to train athletes who are dedicated to their sport or fitness goals, regardless of age, or athletic background.

 “Jeff and Lauren are the ideal candidates to bring the D1 Training experience to Clearwater,” said the brand’s Chief Operating Officer, Dan Murphy. “We’re thrilled to welcome them to the D1 family and are confident in their ability to show the Clearwater area what they’ve been missing out on. D1 is a one-of-a-kind fitness experience that’s built around the individual and meant to help people meet their athletic goals. Our strong network of franchisees embodies our core values to bring the D1 Training vision to life, and we know Jeff and Lauren will do just that in Clearwater and its surrounding communities.”

 Strategically expanding across the nation through franchising, D1 Training has more than 150 facilities open with over 100 additional locations in various stages of development. The brand is currently seeking financially qualified business builders, former athletes, and entrepreneurs, who share a passion for fitness and youth sports, who are ready to make a positive impact on their community.
