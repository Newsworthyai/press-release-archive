# Road to Responsibility and PLAN of MA and RI Renew Partnership

Third year of partnership, support doubled

 Road to Responsibility (RTR), one of the region’s largest and most successful nonprofit organizations supporting individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, is pleased to announce its renewed partnership PLAN of MA and RI, now in its third year.

 The partnership between the two nonprofit organizations was established in October of 2023. Over the course of the past two years PLAN of MA and RI has worked with RTR to help educate individuals, families, staff, and community members about the benefit of special need trusts.

 In support of the continued partnership, PLAN of MA and RI has granted $50,000 to RTR, doubling its contribution from 2024.

 “We’re delighted to once again partner with PLAN of MA and RI, and deeply grateful for this generous grant in support of our programs,” said Christopher T. White, Ed.D., president and CEO of Road to Responsibility. “This collaboration has provided many individuals and families served by RTR with a deeper understanding of available government assistance programs and the merits of special needs trusts.”

 About Road to Responsibility, Inc.

 Celebrating more than 37 years of making lives better, Road to Responsibility, Inc. (RTR) was established in 1988 with the overarching belief that individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities deserve to have full, rich, and rewarding lives in the community, and therefore works to provide the means, the opportunity, and the support necessary to allow citizens with disabilities to take their place as productive members of the community. RTR offers residential, work/employment, day habilitation and other day supports to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. RTR supports individuals with very diverse needs, including those with significant challenges who would otherwise go unserved if not for RTR. It succeeds where other organizations often fail, through the use of an integrated clinical behavioral approach. This model has proven successful and yielded positive results for the organization and the individuals served.

 Road to Responsibility offers services to almost all the towns and communities throughout the South Shore and South Coast of Massachusetts, operates 49 residences as well as co-operative and supportive living apartments, and manages nine day-service locations that focus on education, employment, and community enrichment.
