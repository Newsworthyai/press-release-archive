# State Roundup: Shutdown Highlights Maryland Dependence On Federal Dollars; Trying To Quit A Federal Job, But Unable To And Lawsuits On Pause; Demolition Of Pimlico In Photos

SHUTDOWN PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON MARYLAND DEPENDENCE ON FEDERAL FUNDING: As the federal government shutdown stretches into another week, Maryland’s deep dependence on Washington dollars is once again under the microscope — raising questions about whether state leaders have done enough to diversify the economy and protect taxpayers from the fallout of federal instability.

 FEDERAL SHUTDOWN CAUSES DELAYS EVEN FOR THOSE TRYING TO QUIT: Rebecca Ferguson just wanted to be done with the government, but it seems nothing is easy during a federal shutdown. Not even obtaining the termination papers needed to finalize her departure from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Like countless others seeking government services this week, Ferguson learned firsthand that the world of a federal shutdown is a bleak place characterized by hellish hold times, dead-end calls and emails, and partisan messaging.

 SHUTDOWN PAUSES NOTABLE MARYLAND CIVIL LAWSUITS: The federal government shutdown has put many civil lawsuits involving the Department of Justice on hold. Several notable civil cases in Maryland have been paused amid the shutdown, which began Oct. 1. The shutdown means delayed access to justice in civil cases that seek systemic reform and accountability; it also means some of the administration’s efforts to weaken its perceived enemies are on hold, too. Ian Round/The Daily Record.

 UNAFFILIATED VOTERS ASK JUDGE TO CONTINUE SUIT TO OPEN PRIMARIES: A lawyer representing five unaffiliated voters is asking an Anne Arundel County Circuit Court judge to deny a motion to dismiss their suit challenging a state law that limits the participation of unaffiliated voters in Maryland primary elections. Bryan Sears/Maryland Matters.

 IN PICTURES: PIMLICO RACE COURSE DEMOLITION: Talk of demolishing Pimlico Race Course and building a new racetrack has a long and complicated history all its own. Now that a plan is finally coming to fruition after years of stops and starts, it’s truly something that must be seen to be believed. Baltimore Banner photographer Jerry Jackson has documented the tear-down from the start. Jerry Jackson and Brandon Weigel/The Baltimore Banner.

 STATE-RUN CANNABIS INCUBATOR PROGRAM SEEKS APPLICANTS: Maryland opened applications Tuesday for sites to participate in the nation’s first state-run cannabis incubator program. The program, overseen by the Maryland Cannabis Administration in partnership with the Maryland Economic Development Corporation will “support micro licensees, which include the new subset of licenses issued under the most recent social equity license round, both for microprocessors “]and micro dispensaries.” Mathew Schumer/The Baltimore Sun.

 MARYLAND JOINS CALL FOR SUPREMES TO REVERSE VOTING RIGHTS RULING: Maryland joined 22 other jurisdictions urging the U.S. Supreme Court to take up, and reverse, a ruling that would prohibit individuals from challenging election laws and redistricting issues under the Voting Right Act. The states’ brief, filed Monday, said the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals finding that only state and local governments can file challenges under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 takes away an essential tool in protecting voting rights. Section 2 prohibits racial discrimination in voting laws and policies. William Ford/Maryland Matters.

 MOORE MUM AS NEWSOM, PRITZKER THREATEN TO LEAVE BI-PARTISAN GOVS GROUP: After two of Gov. Wes Moore’s Democratic counterparts threatened to leave the bipartisan governors group of which he is vice chair, Moore has not taken a public position. Moore’s office punted on questions Tuesday about California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker threatening to withdraw their states from the National Governors Association if the group does not condemn President Donald Trump’s deployment of the National Guard to major cities. Mennatalla Ibrahim and Carson Swick/The Baltimore Sun.

 ACTIVISTS OPPOSE NOMINEE, FIRED IN 2014, TO HEAD PG ENVIRO DEPT: Prince George’s County Executive Aisha Braveboy says she has the utmost confidence in her nominee to run the county’s Department of the Environment, even though he was terminated from the department in 2014 for “gross negligence.” A group of environmental and community activists in the county is not so sure. And they’re likely to be on hand Thursday when Samuel Belsham Moki’s nomination comes up before a County Council committee. Christine Condon/Maryland Matters.

 McCORMICK SPICE PROJECTS $140 MILLION IN ‘TARIFF EXPOSURE:’ For a spice giant like McCormick & Co., which relies on many products that can only be grown abroad, tariffs have been top of mind all year. The Hunt Valley-based company said this summer that it expected tariffs to cost them roughly $90 million annually, but after President Donald Trump’s administration enforced more tariffs in August, that number has jumped – to a projected $140 million. Hayes Gardner/The Baltimore Banner.
