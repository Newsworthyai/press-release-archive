# RRE Co-Leads $11M Series A for Crypto Startup True Markets

Cryptocurrency startup True Markets has announced the closing of a $11 million Series A round co-led by Boston-based Accomplice and New York-based RRE Ventures, with participation from Reciprocal Ventures, Variant and PayPal Ventures. The New York company has so far raised $20 million from investors such as Paxos Ventures and Switzerland-based Solana Foundation.

 Along with the raise, the company launched the True Markets app on Apple’s App Store. True Markets said the app would run exclusively on Solana and combines powerful tools designed for retail users, providing a “stablecoin-native DeFi trading experience.” True Markets is a so-called non-custodial platform, meaning it does not hold client assets, eliminating a key risk affecting cryptocurrency startups.

Gupta and Patrick McCreary. At Coinbase, Gupta served as head of exchange, expanding asset coverage and launching two derivatives exchanges. He has also worked at Goldman Sachs and Circle, where he led the launch and growth of the USDC stablecoin. McCreary was a senior engineering leader at Coinbase, helping build Coinbase’s international exchange.

 “We built True Markets to evolve beyond the current state of both traditional and crypto finance,” said Gupta, who has a BS in Computer and Systems Engineering from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. “Retail traders have been stuck with clunky workflows, unclear pricing, and fragmented liquidity. Our goal is to deliver a fairer and more transparent experience that makes asset discovery simple, shows real-time market momentum, and feels as intuitive as the best apps on your phone.”

 True Markets supports Solana-native assets, and uses Turnkey’s secure key infrastructure. It touts low-cost and high-speed access to cryptocurrency traders.

 “Security and simplicity are often at odds in crypto, but True Markets bridges that gap elegantly,” said Bryce Ferguson of Turnkey. “By integrating Turnkey’s secure key infrastructure, they’ve created a platform where users can trade confidently, without ever compromising on control or convenience. We’re proud to support a team that’s pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in decentralized finance.”
