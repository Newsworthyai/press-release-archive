# Devin Noir Brings Devil May Cry Tattoo to Philadelphia

Philadelphia is about to welcome a new creative force. Tattoo artist Devin Noir, the visionary behind Devil May Cry Tattoo, has announced plans to immerse himself in the city’s culture and community this fall. Known for his innovative cyber-sigilism style, Noir is eager to fuse Philadelphia’s rich traditions with his own futuristic aesthetic.

 For Noir, the move is about more than geography. After years of working in New York, he felt drawn to Philadelphia’s authenticity. “I’ve never really felt like New York was home. Philly does,” he explained. Unlike New York, which he describes as variations on the same theme, Philadelphia offers a broad spectrum of experiences that feel genuinely distinct. “In Philly, people are themselves. It’s not performative, and that’s something I’ve been missing.”

 Inspiration from History

 Part of what excites Noir about Philadelphia is its deep connection to the past. From colonial-era houses to centuries-old details like Pennsylvania stars, the presence of history inspires him to imagine new directions for his work. He envisions blending cyber-sigilism with traditional tattoo elements, creating hybrid styles that pay homage to the city’s roots while pushing tattoo art into the future.

 A Thriving Community

 Noir is equally energized by the tattoo community he’s joining. Unlike the sprawling scene in New York, Philadelphia’s tattoo world is close-knit and imaginative. Artists here honor traditional tattooing while reinventing it for modern audiences. “It’s not just copying Sailor Jerry flash; it’s Baby Yoda in trad style, or something equally out of the box, but done beautifully,” Noir said. That kind of creativity, rooted in respect for tradition but fearless in experimentation, is exactly where he wants to be.

 Neighborhood Connections

 When asked about where he feels most at home, Noir pointed to Fishtown and Port Richmond. Both neighborhoods resonate with his vision of community and artistry. “Fishtown is definitely at the top of my list. I love the energy there, and I feel like I fit in without standing out like a sore thumb,” he shared. Port Richmond’s sense of closeness, with its row houses and strong neighborhood bonds, also appeals to him.

 Upcoming Residency

 Noir will begin his Philadelphia chapter this fall with a month-long stay from October 15 through November 15. This window will give him time to wrap up projects in New York before fully embracing Philadelphia’s scene. For local tattoo enthusiasts and collectors of Noir’s work, this marks the first chance to connect with him directly in the city.
