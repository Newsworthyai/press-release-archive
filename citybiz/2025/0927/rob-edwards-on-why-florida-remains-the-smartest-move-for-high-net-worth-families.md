# Rob Edwards On Why Florida Remains the Smartest Move for High-Net-Worth Families

In the rarefied world of wealth management, every decision has lasting consequences. For high-net-worth families, navigating tax structures, estate planning, and real estate ownership can feel overwhelmingly complex. That’s where Rob Edwards stands apart.

 As a nationally recognized advisor and the Managing Director and Senior PIM® Portfolio Manager at Edwards Asset Management, Edwards has built a reputation for simplifying the complexities of wealth. His philosophy, reflected in the firm’s guiding principle “Wealth Simplified,” is rooted in helping affluent families unlock their wealth’s full potential through strategies that balance lifestyle, protection, and legacy.

 With offices in Naples and Fort Lauderdale, Edwards Asset Management is embedded in one of the nation’s most wealth-friendly environments. It’s no coincidence. Edwards has long recognized that Florida offers unique advantages for preserving and transferring wealth, and he has made it his mission to ensure his clients maximize those opportunities.

 “Florida checks a lot of boxes when it comes to preserving wealth,” Edwards explains. “No state income tax, no estate tax, and strong homestead protections. For high net worth families, those are all advantages and opportunities for planning.”

 Florida’s Tax Advantages and Wealth Preservation

 Edwards sees Florida’s appeal as more than its sunshine and lifestyle. The legal and tax framework of the state becomes even more valuable when directly connected to real estate.

 “What makes it even more powerful is how those benefits tie directly into real estate. Your primary home can support your residency claim, limit your property taxes, and, in some cases, provide creditor protection. When structured correctly, owning a home in Florida becomes not just a place to live but a part of your overall wealth strategy.”

 This insight underscores Edwards’s brand promise: clarity in the face of complexity. For families who may see a property only as a residence, Edwards reframes it as a strategic instrument, one that supports both financial goals and generational planning.

 Why Property Title Matters in Florida Estate Planning

 Despite the advantages, Edwards emphasizes that Florida real estate must be structured with precision.

 “One of the most overlooked steps is checking how your Florida property is titled,” he notes. “That means, who legally owns it, how it’s held, and whether it aligns with your estate plan. If your name is the only one on the deed, and you haven’t thought about what happens next, that could create unnecessary taxes, delays, or complications later on. A quick review by your attorney and advisor can help ensure that the way you own your home aligns with what you want.”

 It’s a small detail with an outsized impact. And it’s exactly the kind of overlooked complexity that Edwards is known for simplifying on behalf of his clients.

 Florida Real Estate as a Tool for Protecting and Transferring Wealth

 Florida’s financial framework provides an unmatched environment for wealth preservation. Its lack of income and estate taxes, paired with strong homestead protections, means real estate is far more than a lifestyle purchase; it’s a financial safeguard.

 By connecting these advantages to each client’s broader financial and estate plan, Edwards helps transform properties in Naples or Fort Lauderdale into strategic assets. For his clients, often families with significant wealth at stake, this kind of foresight ensures their success outlasts them.

 Expert Guidance for Select Families

 Edwards’s approach is intentionally selective. His firm accepts only a limited number of new families each year, ensuring every relationship receives the level of focus and personalization it deserves. For those families, the value goes far beyond portfolio management.

 “The opportunity is there, but it’s not automatic,” Edwards explains. “Florida’s laws create the environment, but it’s up to families to make sure their property ownership and estate planning take full advantage of it. That requires coordination between financial advisors, attorneys, and tax professionals.”

 Edwards sees his role as the bridge, simplifying the decisions, orchestrating the strategy, and providing clarity where wealth is most complex.

 “When structured correctly, owning a home in Florida becomes not just a place to live but a part of your overall wealth strategy,” he concludes.
