# How Bigleaf Networks Quietly Became the Go-To Network Redundancy Solution for Internet-Dependent Brands

As businesses increasingly rely on cloud-based services, internet downtime has become a direct threat to revenue. From hospitals to restaurants, even a few minutes of disruption can derail operations. Despite that urgency, many organizations still lack a true network redundancy plan or assume their existing setup is “good enough.”

 That’s where Bigleaf Networks has found its niche. Rather than compete on noise, the Oregon-based company focused on solving the core problem of keeping businesses connected with zero disruption.

 “We built Bigleaf with a clear goal: to help businesses stay connected no matter what,” said Lori Stout, CMO at Bigleaf Networks. “Our platform keeps critical cloud applications running by intelligently optimizing and routing internet traffic across multiple connections, with no need to rip and replace existing systems. That reliability and ease of use have earned trust from industries where downtime simply isn’t an option.”

 Plug-and-Play SD-WAN: A Simpler Approach to Multi-ISP Connectivity

 Legacy SD-WAN solutions often require ripping out firewalls, changing ISPs, or layering on expensive, complex tools. Bigleaf reversed that approach with a non-intrusive deployment model: install in minutes, outside the firewall, and fully compatible with any internet provider.

 “Most legacy or enterprise-focused solutions require replacing or reengineering parts of your existing infrastructure,” said Stout. “Bigleaf was built to be easy from the start. We install in minutes, run outside your firewall, and optimize connectivity across any ISP. That makes us ideal for organizations that want redundancy without complexity.”

 This ease of use has positioned Bigleaf as the preferred SD-WAN choice for organizations with lean IT teams or dozens, sometimes hundreds, of branch locations to manage.

 Solving the Connectivity Challenges of Multi-Location and Remote Businesses

 As distributed workforces grow and applications move to the cloud, consistent connectivity is more important than ever. IT teams must ensure uptime across remote sites, call centers, retail locations, and home offices, often with limited staff.

 “There’s a rising demand for reliable performance across distributed environments, especially with remote teams and cloud applications,” said David Idle, Chief Product Officer at Bigleaf. “Customers need visibility, automation, and a solution that doesn’t burden already thin IT resources, and that’s what we’ve built our platform around.”

 Bigleaf’s intelligent routing, real-time performance visibility, and same-IP failover offer a turnkey solution for exactly these use cases, without overhauling your existing infrastructure.

 5G and Wireless Failover: Bigleaf Edge 800W for Always-On Internet

 To support wireless-first and hybrid network deployments, including in rural and underserved areas, Bigleaf launched the Edge 800W, a plug-and-play router with built-in 5G wireless backup. This product is especially valuable for industries where downtime isn’t just a risk, it’s an operational threat.

 “In many rural and underserved areas, wireless isn’t just a backup; it’s often the only reliable option,” said Idle. “We’re seeing strong growth in wireless-first and hybrid connectivity models, especially when paired with SD-WAN and satellite. With Edge 800W and Wireless Connect, we offer a plug-and-play solution that brings enterprise-grade reliability without requiring a full infrastructure overhaul. It’s a practical path to uptime for businesses where traditional connectivity just doesn’t cut it.”

 With same-IP failover, dynamic QoS, and cloud-based monitoring built in, the Edge 800W makes it possible for small and mid-sized businesses to achieve enterprise-level internet reliability.

 Bigleaf Networks Is the Internet Failover Solution Brands Rely On

 Uptime isn’t theory; it’s the difference between sales closing, patients checked in, or calls going through. Bigleaf’s platform keeps that baseline steady by running outside the firewall, optimizing traffic across any ISP, and failing over without changing IPs.

 For retailers, clinics, and franchises spread across dozens of sites, it’s the kind of reliability that shows up in fewer support tickets, smoother cloud sessions, and operations that stay invisible to the end user. In other words, not just redundancy on paper, continuity you can count on in the field.
