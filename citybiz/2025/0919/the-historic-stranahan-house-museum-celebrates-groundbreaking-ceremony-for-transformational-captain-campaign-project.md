# The Historic Stranahan House Museum Celebrates Groundbreaking Ceremony for Transformational Captain Campaign Project

On Wednesday, Sept. 17, the Historic Stranahan House Museum – the oldest house in Fort Lauderdale and the epicenter of Broward County’s long and fascinating history – celebrated the groundbreaking of the museum’s campus-wide transformation into the “Center of Community,” a return to its original role in 1901 as Fort Lauderdale’s first gathering place. Florida State Representative Chip LaMarca, Florida Senator Rosalind Osgood, Broward County Commissioner Lamar P. Fisher, City of Fort Lauderdale Commissioner Ben Sorensen, City of Fort Lauderdale Commissioner Steve Glassman and City of Fort Lauderdale and Broward County dignitaries joined the Stranahan House’s Executive Director Jennifer Belt, incoming Board President Maggie Gunther, Board of Directors and donors for the celebration.

 In 2018, the Stranahan House embarked on a transformational capital improvement campaign to further protect the historic site and create new opportunities for locals and visitors alike. The Capital Campaign aims to enhance Stranahan House’s facilities and offerings, ensuring its continued significance as a vital cultural institution. Accomplishments to date include the new seawall, the New River Patio, and updated historic porches donated by Old Florida Lumber. The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2026.

 “We’re proud to break ground on our transformational Capital Campaign project, transforming the Historic Stranahan House Museum into the ‘Center of Community,’ a return to its original role in 1901 as Fort Lauderdale’s first gathering place,” said Executive Director Jennifer Belt. “These enhancements will allow residents and visitors of all ages to learn about Fort Lauderdale’s fascinating history, furthering the community’s social, cultural and historical viability. This would not be possible without the vision and generosity of our dedicated donors, partners and community stakeholders who are committed to creating a space that will serve the Fort Lauderdale community and inspire generations to come.”

 This innovative expansion, led by architect Leo Hansen, Miller Construction, EDSA, and Brizaga, marks the official start of construction for the Capital Campaign improvements, ensuring the Stranahan House continues to serve as a vibrant gathering place for generations to come.

 The renovation of the administration building will include The Egret Classroom, a state-of-the-art education center funded by a Private Family Foundation, and the Kitchenworks Hospitality Center. New ADA-compliant facilities, including restrooms, as well as an on-site archival and storage facility, will enhance the museum’s ability to serve the community and preserve its collections for future generations. The Mosser Family Education Planning Center, funded by John and Pamela Wilkes, will ensure the creation of new, dynamic programming.

 The east side of the property will be home to a new welcome center featuring a ticketing window and gift shop, funded by the City of Fort Lauderdale, and an event pavilion, funded by Broward, Palm Beaches, and St. Lucie Realtors. The Rogers Family Foundation donated the Virginia and Dwight Rogers Courtyard, an additional location for community gatherings and celebrations.

 Spearheaded by committed supporters and patrons, the Stranahan House kicked off the $3.3 million capital campaign by announcing it had raised $2.7 million from generous organizations, including the Broward County Cultural Division, the Fritch Foundation, the R.O. Powell Family Foundation, the Salah Foundation, and the Ted Drum family. Wayne and Lucretia Weiner ignited momentum and enthusiasm within the community with a $100,000 match donation in 2024. Lead gifts were generously provided by Tripp Scott and the Hudson Family Foundation. This campus-wide improvement plan has been met with great support from partners and community stakeholders. The recent state appropriations have allowed the Stranahan House to reach almost 75% of its funding goal.

 “The Stranahan House is a cornerstone of Fort Lauderdale’s history and a symbol of our community’s resilience. This transformation will preserve our rich heritage while creating a vibrant space for generations to come,” said Florida State Senator Rosalind Osgood.

 “The Stranahan House is a special gem in our community, and the Broward County Commission, along with Fort Lauderdale residents, understand the importance of maintaining this historical portion of the city alive. This renovation will only enhance the museum’s vitality, and I cannot wait to be at the ribbon cutting to see it in all its glory,” said Broward County Commissioner Lamar P. Fisher.

 “I’m so excited about the groundbreaking of Stranahan House’s museum and welcome center. It’s extremely important that we maintain Fort Lauderdale’s rich history even as the city grows and matures,” said Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis. “The museum and welcome center will take the property to the next level as one of the city’s most important historical elements. It also has the added bonus of boosting the Las Olas portion of our downtown and the whole Riverwalk area. I look forward to its opening.”

 “Stranahan House is a Fort Lauderdale treasure, and the City of Fort Lauderdale is a proud supporter as we take this historic site into the future,” said Fort Lauderdale Commissioner Steve Glassman.
