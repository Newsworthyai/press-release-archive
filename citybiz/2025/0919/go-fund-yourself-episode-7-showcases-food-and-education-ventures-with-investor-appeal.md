# Go Fund Yourself Episode 7 Showcases Food and Education Ventures with Investor Appeal

Episode 7 of Go Fund Yourself on Cheddar TV highlighted two fast-growing companies aiming to disrupt very different industries: Want Italy, a modern Italian dining concept at New York City’s Oculus, and MVP Kids, a social-emotional learning platform helping children build resilience and character.

 For both startups, the national spotlight represents more than a televised pitch. Appearing on Go Fund Yourself brings exposure to millions of viewers, mentorship from the show’s Titans, and direct access to investors through campaigns.

 Want Italy: Premium Pasta at Speed

 At the bustling Oculus/World Trade Center, Want Italy is redefining fast-casual dining. Its Pasta & Go concept features chefs preparing dishes to order, paired with espresso and curated Italian retail products. The model is designed to combine theater-style preparation with impulse retail and delivery integrations—creating multiple revenue streams beyond traditional dining.

 Investors see potential in Want Italy’s ability to scale the experience to other high-traffic locations while retaining authenticity. Challenges remain in consistent chef training and sourcing authentic Italian ingredients, but the concept has already proven appeal in one of the most competitive restaurant markets in the world.

 MVP Kids: Building the Next Generation

 MVP Kids takes a mission-driven approach, creating children’s books, puppets, and toolkits that deliver social-emotional learning (SEL) content. Its Inspire Character® brand is built around four pillars—Nurture Literacy, Cultivate Mentorship, Expand Education, and Enrich Entertainment—to help children develop empathy, integrity, and community skills.

 With 77 published titles, family and classroom kits, and partnerships across education and retail channels, MVP Kids is positioned as both an impact-focused and commercially scalable venture. The challenge now lies in broad distribution and curriculum adoption at scale. Learn more about investment opportunities for MVP Kids here.

 The Value of the Platform

 The Go Fund Yourself format continues to prove its value as a launchpad for entrepreneurs:

 * Visibility – National television exposure introduces companies to customers and investors.
* Mentorship – Guidance from Titans such as Rory Cutaia, Jayson Waller, and David Meltzer adds immediate strategic value.
* Capital Access – Direct Wefunder links give viewers the chance to participate in each startup’s growth journey.

 For Want Italy, this could accelerate expansion into new markets. For MVP Kids, it means distributing SEL tools to more classrooms and families nationwide.
