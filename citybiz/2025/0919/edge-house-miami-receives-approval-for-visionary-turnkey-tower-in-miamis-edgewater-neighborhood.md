# Edge House Miami Receives Approval for Visionary Turnkey Tower in Miami’s Edgewater Neighborhood

Grupo T&C, a leading international developer, announces that Edge House Miami, a 56-story luxury home-sharing tower designed by Kobi Karp, has officially received approval from the City of Miami’s Urban Development Review Board. The decision paves the way for the transformative project at 1825 NE 4th Avenue in Miami’s Edgewater neighborhood, setting the stage for the next phase of development.

 “This marks a major milestone as we move closer to bringing a first-of-its-kind living experience to one of Miami’s most desirable neighborhoods,” said William Ticona, Founder & CEO of Grupo T&C. “Edge House Miami represents the future of urban living with a fusion of luxury, flexibility, and thoughtful design that responds to how today’s residents want to live, work, and invest.”

 Envisioned as a forward-thinking community hub, Edge House Miami will feature 608 turnkey units ranging from studios to three-bedroom homes, with fully furnished interiors by Adriana Hoyos Design Studio. Residences span from 410 to 1,242 square feet and will showcase high-end finishes, floor-to-ceiling windows, nine-foot ceilings, private outdoor terraces, and Smart Building technology.

 “Edgewater has quickly become one of Miami’s most dynamic neighborhoods, and Edge House Miami will add to that momentum in a meaningful way,” said Carlos Lago, Shareholder of the Greenberg Traurig Miami Land Use & Land Development Practice. “We are proud to have worked alongside Grupo T&C and Kobi Karp Architecture & Interior Design to make this beautiful project a reality. Congratulations on Edge House’s approval by the City of Miami’s Urban Development Review Board!”
