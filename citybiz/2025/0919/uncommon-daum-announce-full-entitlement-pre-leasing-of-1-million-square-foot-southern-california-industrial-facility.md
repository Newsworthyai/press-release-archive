# Uncommon, DAUM Announce Full Entitlement, Pre-Leasing Of 1 Million+ Square-Foot Southern California Industrial Facility

DAUM Commercial Real Estate Services, a leading provider of commercial real estate services including brokerage, tenant representation, consulting, leasing, sales, and property management, announces the full entitlement and pre-leasing of the Apple Valley AV One Million Distribution Center in Apple Valley, California. The state-of-the-art industrial facility is the first phase in a 550-acre master-planned project by Los Angeles-based real estate group Uncommon Developers, according to Rick John, SIOR, Executive Vice President and Branch Manager at DAUM’s Inland Empire Office.

 “The Apple Valley One Million Distribution Center’s features and location, including its expansive footprint, modern infrastructure, and excellent connectivity to major transportation routes, will support large-scale distribution, manufacturing, and logistics operations,” says John. “We’re proud to serve as Uncommon’s partner in bringing this building to market. The property offers an ideal solution for any business seeking to optimize their supply chain and operations, an increasingly rare opportunity in Southern California.”

 John and Dan Foye, Executive Vice President and Principal at DAUM’s Inland Empire Office, represent Uncommon in leasing the soon-to-be-built property.

 “The High Desert North Inland Empire region is attracting industrial development due to the business-friendly environment and growing skilled labor pool it offers, while still being within 100 miles, or under 2-hour drive, to the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach,” explains Foye. “More affordable land and lease rates compared to Los Angeles and other Inland Empire markets and reduced congestion drive cost savings and efficiencies for developers, owners, and occupiers.”

 John notes that in addition to providing direct access to Interstate 15, State Route 18, and US Route 395, the development is near Southern California Logistics Airport (SCLA), a major cargo hub with air freight capabilities, and the upcoming Barstow International Gateway (BIG), which will be an approximately 4,500-acre new integrated rail facility on the west side of Barstow.

 “The positioning of this property in Apple Valley facilitates highly efficient regional and national distribution capabilities,” continues John. “The facility is an exciting part of the growth and economic development of the High Desert, and what is planned to ultimately be a 550-acre project leveraging the location, scalability, and access to power rare for the market.”

 Apple Valley One Million Distribution Center is planned to have a total building area of 1,080,078 square feet with 40-foot minimum building height, 219 dock-high doors, four ground-level doors, EV charging stations for cars and trucks, 8,000 amps of power expandable to 16,000 amps, and office and mezzanine space situated on a 72-acre site with ample car and trailer parking.

 With the completed entitlement process, groundbreaking and vertical construction can move forward rapidly to meet desired occupancy date.
