# State Roundup: Audit Says Agency May Have Housed Foster Kids With Sex Offenders; Lawmakers To Schedule Hearings; Community Blasts Landfill Discharge Request

AUDIT: SSA MAY HAVE HOUSED FOSTER KIDS WITH REGISTERED SEX OFFENDERS: Maryland failed to protect children under state care from being placed in homes where registered sex offenders lived. It’s one of numerous findings listed in an audit of the Social Services Administration that came out Wednesday. The audit documented additional problems ranging from lack of medical care for foster children to children living in hotels instead of homes. Pamela Wood and Brenda Wintrode/The Baltimore Banner.

 * The 70-page audit released Wednesday includes a slate of concerning findings dating back to 2008 and new findings that include nearly $700,000 in penalties for failing to meet federal foster care service requirements. Bryan Sears/Maryland Matters.
* According to the audit, from May 2020 to May 2024 the SSA did not ensure criminal background checks were conducted on workers interacting with children. One employee was charged with sexual assault of a minor and with crimes related to the children in his care. Chevall Pryce/The Baltimore Sun.

 CRITICAL SOCIAL SERVICES AUDIT PROMPTS LEGISLATIVE HEARINGS: Maryland lawmakers plan to hold hearings in coming weeks on reports that the Social Services Administration may have let children in its care be housed with registered sex offenders, just one of many allegations in an audit of a “broken” agency.

 FERGUSON HESITATES ON REDRAWING CONGRESSIONAL MAPS: Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said Tuesday it’s too early to commit to legislation to redraw the state’s congressional districts before the next Census.

 NEW STATE PARK TO CELEBRATE FAMILY WHO FOUNDED AFRO NEWSPAPER: For more than 60 years, the dense forests of Patuxent River State Park have cradled a secret.

 BALTIMORE COUNTY LACKS FREE PUBLIC POOLS: Baltimore County does not have a single public pool that is free to residents, while the city of Baltimore has 16 — several of which are newly renovated, thanks to $41 million in Covid-19 relief funds. Rona Kobell/The Baltimore Banner.

 NEW MICROSOFT CENTER PART OF STATE QUANTUM SCIENCE PUSH: Microsoft is opening a new quantum research center near the University of Maryland, part of a push to make the state a hub for quantum science.
