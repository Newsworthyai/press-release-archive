# Georgia’s Own Expands Partnership With University of Georgia Athletics

Georgia’s Own Credit Union, the third-largest credit union in Georgia, is announcing an expansion of its partnership with the University of Georgia (UGA) athletic program, putting an increased focus on women’s sports. The centerpiece of the new agreement includes the painting of the Georgia’s Own Credit Union logo on the softball field at Jack Turner Softball Stadium, marking the first time a corporate partner has had an on-field logo at any UGA facility.

 “As we’ve seen through Caitlin Clark storming the WNBA and ESPN partnering with Athletes Unlimited Softball League, women’s athletics are driving fan interest nationwide at never-before-seen levels,” said Dave Preter, president and CEO of Georgia’s Own Credit Union. “Both of those leagues rely on stars forged at the collegiate level, so we are thrilled to be making a sizable investment in one of the best women’s college athletics programs in the nation.”

 The new agreement also makes Georgia’s Own the presenting sponsor of the 2026 UGA softball team. Head Coach Tony Baldwin is entering his fifth year with the program, which drew a record 56,921 fans to Jack Turner Softball Stadium in 2025 and was just one win shy of its sixth trip to the Women’s College World Series in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

 “What Georgia’s Own Credit Union has done here is tremendous for our program. To see softball at the center of this historic first for Georgia Athletics shows just how far the game has come and how bright the future is,” said UGA Softball Head Coach Tony Baldwin. “The investment Georgia’s Own is making in our team through a program-wide NIL deal not only provides life-changing opportunities for our student-athletes, but it also validates the hard work, commitment, and excellence they bring to this University every day. This is a milestone moment for our program, and we’re grateful to Georgia’s Own for leading the way.”

 In addition to having a ubiquitous presence at UGA softball events, Georgia’s Own will continue to be featured at football and men’s basketball games. The Credit Union is also increasing its visibility at gymnastics meets and women’s basketball games, with the new pact including more appearances on digital signage boards at Stegeman Coliseum. The Credit Union has been in partnership with UGA Athletics for over a decade.

 “This partnership with Georgia’s Own Credit Union represents a significant moment for Georgia Athletics. To have the first on-field logos at UGA placed in support of women’s sports sends a powerful message about the value, visibility, and growth of our female student-athletes and programs. Georgia’s Own is not only investing in our tradition of excellence, but also in the future of women’s sports by helping us create a milestone that will be remembered for years to come,” said J. Reid Parker Director of Athletics Josh Brooks.
