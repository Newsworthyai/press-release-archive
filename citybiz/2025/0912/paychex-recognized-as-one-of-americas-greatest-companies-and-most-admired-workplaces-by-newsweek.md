# Paychex Recognized as One of America’s Greatest Companies and Most Admired Workplaces by Newsweek

Paychex, Inc. (Nasdaq: PAYX), an industry-leading human capital management (HCM) company, has recently been named one of America’s Greatest Companies 2025 by Newsweek. Through an in-depth analysis across four key pillars of success, Newsweek and Plant-A Insights Group compiled the list after evaluating and rating each company on performance, dedication to the American workforce, track record of innovation, and commitment to environmental sustainability and corporate ethics.

 Paychex was also recognized among Newsweek and Plant-A Insights’ America’s Most Admired Workplaces. The inaugural list highlights companies that successfully attract and retain employees – organizations that jobseekers would like to work for and that employees respect. To compile the list, more than 250,000 U.S. employees were surveyed, and the ranking was based on three dimensions: inspirational factor, aspirational factor, and overall company performance.

 “We are honored to be recognized by Newsweek as one of America’s Greatest Companies, a distinction that reflects our strong financial performance, ongoing product innovation, and commitment to ethics – all in support of our mission to help businesses succeed,” said John Gibson, president and CEO of Paychex. “Being named among Newsweek’s Most Admired Workplaces list further underscores the critical role our 19,000 employees play in driving our success. They are the foundation of our achievements, and these accolades are a testament to their dedication, talent, and shared commitment to excellence.”

“A great workplace is one that strives to make all its employees feel respected and appreciated. But ensuring that employees are comfortable and valued is something only some companies excel at,” said Newsweek Editor-in-Chief Jennifer H. Cunningham.

 For over 50 years, Paychex has empowered businesses through a purpose-driven culture rooted in six core values: integrity, partnership, accountability, respect, innovation, and service. This commitment to responsible business practices has earned the company many recognitions in 2025, including Ethisphere’s World’s Most Ethical Companies and Fortune’s America’s Most Innovative Companies.
