# Parenting Tech Meets Craft Spirits: Illoominate and Hook Hand Rum Headline Go Fund Yourself Season 3, Episode 6

On September 11, 2025, two very different companies will take center stage on Cheddar TV’s Go Fund Yourself: Illoominate, a parenting companion app, and Hook Hand Rum, a California-based craft spirits startup. Both ventures reflect sectors undergoing rapid change — digital wellness and consumer packaged goods — and both are seeking capital to scale.

 

 Illoominate: Capturing the Parenting-Tech Market

 Illoominate was launched out of Bright Start Ed-Tech with a focus on one of the fastest-growing categories in wellness and education: parenting technology. The app integrates multiple features — daily inspiration, curated blogs, interactive activities, and private reflection tools — into a single platform designed to boost parental confidence and strengthen family connections.

 But what separates Illoominate from other apps is its dual growth strategy. On the B2C side, the company targets direct downloads and retention through content and community engagement. On the B2B side, it aims to partner with corporations as part of employee wellness programs and with school systems as supplemental family support tools.

 The model places Illoominate in a strategic position within a sector where employers are investing heavily in family-friendly benefits. As organizations compete for talent, child and family support tools are increasingly viewed as differentiators. Illoominate’s moderated, measurable approach is designed to make it a fit for enterprise adoption. Learn more about investment opportunities at https://www.illoominate.net/investors

 Hook Hand Rum: Competing in Craft Spirits

 In contrast, Hook Hand Rum represents a traditional consumer packaged goods play in the highly competitive spirits market. Founded in Dana Point, California, by two bartenders with hospitality backgrounds, the company is positioning itself as a premium lifestyle brand anchored by a distinctive infusion of blood orange and Madagascar vanilla.

 The U.S. craft spirits industry surpassed $7 billion in annual sales and continues to expand. However, distribution remains a bottleneck for emerging players. Hook Hand Rum’s growth strategy will depend on securing wholesale relationships, expanding retail footprint, and gaining placement in high-traffic restaurants and bars.

 From an investment standpoint, the key questions will revolve around production scalability, unit economics, and brand differentiation in a crowded market where hundreds of new products are introduced each year. Investment information is here.

 Strategic Value of Go Fund Yourself

 What makes Go Fund Yourself noteworthy is not just the pitch format but the panel. The three Titans — Rory Cutaia, David Meltzer, and Jayson Waller — evaluate companies not only on product but also on scalability, strategy, and market timing. Their feedback often reflects investor concerns that extend far beyond the show.

 * Cutaia focuses on infrastructure and long-term vision.
* Meltzer pushes founders to articulate purpose-driven positioning.
* Waller zeroes in on execution, sales, and operational discipline.

 For Illoominate, national exposure could accelerate partnerships in the corporate and education sectors. For Hook Hand Rum, the visibility provides leverage in negotiations with distributors and investors in the crowded CPG space.

 Both companies represent sectors where consumer demand is strong, but execution will determine who captures market share.
