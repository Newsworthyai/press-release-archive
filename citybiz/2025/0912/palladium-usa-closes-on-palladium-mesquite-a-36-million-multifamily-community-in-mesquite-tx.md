 “We closed our equity and debt placement on August 28, 2025, and construction began. This project represents Palladium USA’s ongoing commitment to providing high-quality, mixed-income housing in Mesquite, Texas, and for the surrounding community. Palladium Mesquite will deliver 111 thoughtfully designed homes in two five-story buildings with a great amenity package. We are grateful to our partners and the City of Mesquite for helping bring more housing options to Dallas County,” says Tom Huth, President and CEO of Palladium USA.

 “We are excited to once again work with Palladium on bringing workforce housing to Mesquite! This has been a high priority of the City Council in our efforts to provide a variety of housing choices for our growing community. Palladium has proven their commitment to developing quality communities, and we look forward to welcoming another project to our downtown area,” Mayor Daniel Alemán Jr. said.

 Palladium Mesquite was designed by HEDK Architects, and BBL Building Company will serve as the general contractor in partnership with Operation Community Care Living. The financing structure for this placement included $17.6m in equity from Redstone, a $14m FHA 221(d)(4) loan arranged by Walker & Dunlop, a $13.1m equity bridge loan from Bridgewater Bank, $4m in TDHCA MFDL, and $500 in City of Mesquite local participation.
