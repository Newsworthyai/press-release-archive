# City of Miami Declares Coconut Grove the Official “Brunch Capital”

Coconut Grove has officially earned its latest claim to fame: “The Brunch Capital of Miami.” In a recent proclamation, the City of Miami recognized the neighborhood’s dynamic culinary scene, celebrating its diverse brunch offerings and lively weekend atmosphere. The designation reinforces Coconut Grove’s status as a premier destination for both locals and visitors in search of a top-tier brunch experience.

 The recognition comes as the neighborhood continues to experience a culinary boom, boasting over 20 popular restaurants within the Coconut Grove Business Improvement District (BID). From classic American favorites to globally inspired dishes, the area’s brunch scene showcases the creativity and variety that have made it a standout in South Florida’s food landscape.

 To commemorate the new title, Coconut Grove will launch its inaugural “The Grove Brunch Club” for National Brunch Day on Saturday, September 21, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Participating restaurants will offer signature brunch specials at unbeatable prices, giving guests a flavorful reason to explore the district and celebrate its latest accolade.

 The City’s proclamation also highlights the ongoing efforts of the Coconut Grove BID, which plays a central role in supporting local businesses, enhancing the district’s appeal, and attracting culinary tourism. Through events like The Grove Brunch Club and continued investment in the area’s growth, the BID is helping to shape Coconut Grove into a vibrant destination.

 “We’re not only thrilled to be named Miami’s Brunch Capital by Miami New Times, but we also love any opportunity to spotlight the incredible culinary talent here in the Grove,” said Coconut Grove BID’s Executive Director, Mark Burns. “To us, it’s about building Coconut Grove’s identity as a year-round brunch haven that locals and tourists will continue to cherish!”

 The celebration is set to further position Coconut Grove not only as a hub for brunch lovers but also as a model for community-driven economic development through food and hospitality. As the neighborhood gears up for the upcoming event, excitement is building among restaurateurs, residents, and food enthusiasts eager to toast to Miami’s newly crowned brunch hotspot.
