# GBC Issues RFI to Design Private Capital Strategy to Support Neighborhood Revitalization

Baltimore initiative seeks partners to mobilize private investment in largest neighborhood reinvestment program in city history

 The Greater Baltimore Committee (GBC) has released a Request for Information (RFI) inviting partners to help design and implement a private capital strategy that will guide billions of dollars in investment to eliminate vacant properties and rebuild Baltimore’s neighborhoods.

 The RFI represents the next major step in the city’s historic 15-year, multi-billion-dollar vacant housing and community redevelopment effort supported by the State of Maryland, the City of Baltimore and BUILD Baltimore, and coordinated through Reinvest Baltimore, established by Governor Wes Moore’s 2024 Executive Order.

 “Maryland’s strength has always been in its ability to bring the public and private sectors together to solve complex challenges,” said Mark Anthony Thomas, President and CEO of the Greater Baltimore Committee. “This is our moment to apply that same ingenuity to Baltimore’s most historically disinvested neighborhoods — and to design bold, practical ways to deploy, align, and administer capital so it truly drives lasting change. We’re seeking great ideas and capable partners who can help us build the financial architecture that makes neighborhood reinvestment work at scale.”

 The RFI seeks responses from investment firms, banks, CDFIs, philanthropies and financial experts capable of designing and managing investment vehicles that align with public funding commitments and local priorities. The selected partner or consortium will play a key role in developing strategies to attract and deploy private investment, strengthen disinvested neighborhoods and ensure financing approaches complement public priorities.

 “This process will help Baltimore build the financial infrastructure to support block by block redevelopment,” said Jennifer Vey, Executive Vice President of GBC. “Our goal is to bring together civic and financial partners who understand that rebuilding Baltimore’s housing market is essential to the Region’s economic future.”

 The RFI outlines opportunities to establish a new set of pooled financing structures to provide working capital loans, construction loans, rental term debt, and shared appreciation mortgages to support the redevelopment of vacant housing and surrounding communities.

 Key RFI dates include:

 * Questions due: October 25, 2025
* Responses to questions published: November 1, 2025
* RFI submissions due: November 21, 2025

 The full RFI and submission guidelines are available online here.

 As the private-sector lead for this initiative, GBC is eager to identify partner organizations that can help mobilize private and philanthropic investment that aligns with public commitments, using financing strategies that reflect both market realities and community goals.
