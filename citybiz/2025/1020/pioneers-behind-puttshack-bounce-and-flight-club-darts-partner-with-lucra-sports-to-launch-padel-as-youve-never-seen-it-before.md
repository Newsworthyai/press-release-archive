# Pioneers Behind Puttshack, Bounce and Flight Club Darts Partner With Lucra Sports To Launch Padel as You’ve Never Seen It Before

Lucra, the leading social competition platform, today announced its first venture into the Padel space through a strategic partnership with No Strings, Inc, a tech-enabled padel club concept still in stealth that is marrying smart-court hardware with hospitality-grade social spaces. The collaboration embeds Lucra’s white-label technology directly into No Strings’ mobile ecosystem, in-venue kiosks, and on-court screens, empowering players to compete in head-to-head matches, knockout tournaments, and group play for everything from $5 cash to limited-edition sponsored products—all verified and settled in real time.

 “Padel is exploding worldwide, yet technology is only just beginning to amplify the on-court fun,” said Michael Madding, Chief Operating Officer at Lucra Sports. “By partnering with No Strings’ computer-vision scoring, we turn every rally into a trackable datapoint and every friendly wager into a friction-free settlement—no spreadsheets, no IOUs. It’s the perfect launchpad for Lucra’s expansion into racket sports, where we can plug directly into existing infrastructure to unlock new revenue streams while being additive to the play experience.”

 For Dov Penzik, Chief Executive Officer of No Strings, Inc, a successful multi-time founder within the competitive social entertainment industry, the partnership cements the company’s position as a first mover in the sport: “our technology is built to foster local community and competition through world-class facilities and cutting-edge tech. Lucra lets us amplify that ethos —imagine neighbourhood ladders on Monday, company tournaments on Tuesday, and a $10,000 invitational streamed live on Saturday, all finalized in-app before players even hit the snack bar. Together we’re proving that the future of padel is as much about software as it is about hardware––this partnership marks an exciting and significant step forward for the sport.”

 First-of-Its-Kind Advantages

 * More Visits, Longer Stays — Venues running Lucra contests typically see guest frequency and average dwell-time increase, thanks to replay features, auto-generated scoring, and live leaderboarding keeping players climbing for that top spot.
* Configurable Prizing — Operators can toggle between cash pots, credits, or (sponsor funded) rewards, driving up average per customer spend
* Zero Operational Drag — Lucra manages identity verification, geolocation, compliance, and risk, integrating with the Concept’s booking and POS systems in just weeks.

 For No Strings, the partnership represents an investment in modern, behavior-driven customer engagement. By leveraging Lucraʼs technology, the platform can reward players for participating in fun, social experiences that drive loyalty and ongoing connection with others.

 Through this partnership, Lucra continues its expansion into new verticals, demonstrating the flexibility of its technology to support a wide variety of applications and industries. By meeting players where they are, Lucra is rapidly growing its addressable market and broadening its brand appeal across physical and digital spaces.

 With launch planned in the coming months, both companies aim to deliver a best-in-class social competition layer that reminds everyone of the joy of competition and makes every game more meaningful and rewarding for players.

 No Strings Co has now opened its Series A round to fund its launch of and expansion into new clubs across North America. Inquiries can be sent to dov@no-strings.com.
