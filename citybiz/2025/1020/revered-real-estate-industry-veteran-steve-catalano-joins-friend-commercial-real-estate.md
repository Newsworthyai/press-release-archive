# Revered Real Estate Industry Veteran, Steve Catalano, Joins Friend Commercial Real Estate

Friend Commercial Real Estate (Friend) is pleased to announce that Steve Catalano, a commercial real estate industry veteran, has joined Friend to focus on continuing to provide best-in-class brokerage services for his rolodex of clients.

 Mr. Catalano, who was first licensed in 1977, has over 45 years of real estate experience and joins Friend from Commercial 100, a Prince George’s County based real estate brokerage he founded in 1989.

 Throughout his career, Mr. Catalano has completed over $170,000,000 in commercial transactions, encompassing both sales and leasing. He has won numerous awards related to real estate sales including, earlier in his career, having been recognized as the number one salesperson in Prince George’s County by the Prince George’s County Board of Realtors for his commercial real estate sales volume.

 “We are thrilled to welcome Mr. Catalano to Friend Commercial Real Estate,” said Joseph Friend, founding partner and broker at Friend. “You’d be hard-pressed to find someone with comparable transactional experience and years under his belt. Steve brings not only deep market knowledge and a loyal client base, but also a reputation of success – he’s inherently a winner. Steve shaped and continues to define the role of a commercial real estate agent/broker in Maryland. His contributions to the evolution of our local economies would be historic if it wasn’t for his best work being yet to come. Steve’s addition further strengthens our presence across Maryland, and we’re excited to see the continued success he’ll bring to our growing team.”

 “I’m excited to join Friend Commercial Real Estate,” said Mr. Catalano. “I’ve long been familiar with Friend’s strong market presence and stellar reputation. Their experienced team and comprehensive in-house resources provide the ideal platform to continue delivering exceptional results for my clients.”

 In addition to his busy commercial practice, Mr. Catalano is a past President and Board of Director for the Maryland / DC CCIM Chapter and earned a CCIM designation in 1986.
