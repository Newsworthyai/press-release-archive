# GCON Acquired by Webcor LP in New Strategic Relationship

Webcor LP, a full-service commercial builder headquartered in San Francisco, announces the acquisition of GCON, a construction management firm based in Phoenix. The transaction is expected to close in Q4 2025, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

 This strategic relationship enables Webcor to leverage GCON’s expertise in critical environments – including data centers and semiconductor projects­­­ – to expand into high-growth technology markets.

 “This is an exciting opportunity for Webcor to expand our portfolio and enter previously untapped markets,” said Webcor President and CEO Matt Rossie. “GCON brings deep expertise in the technology sector. Together, we’ll be able to pursue new opportunities while respecting each of our unique strengths and capabilities.”

 GCON will benefit from Webcor and its parent company Obayashi’s depth of experience and increased bandwidth to pursue larger projects in GCON’s current local and regional technology, healthcare, aviation, commercial and public works markets.

 “We’re thrilled to be launching our strategic relationship with Webcor,” said GCON CEO Mike Godbehere. We’re joining forces with a respected California construction firm that aligns with our steadfast commitment to safety, quality, innovation and community. We’re excited to continue growing and serving our clients with the support of Webcor’s resources and capabilities.”

 GCON will continue operating as a separate company, retaining its leadership, employees, vision, brand and Arizona headquarters. GCON and Webcor remain deeply committed to their clients, project partners and valued teams. This strategic relationship sets the stage for a more robust competitive advantage as both companies look forward to mutual growth, strengthened capabilities and expanded reach.

 RBC Capital Markets served as GCON’s exclusive financial advisor for this transaction, and BaseRock Partners represented Webcor.
