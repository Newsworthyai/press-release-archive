Arrive AI (NASDAQ:ARAI), an autonomous delivery network anchored by patented AI-powered Arrive Points, today announced its inclusion in the Russell 2000® and the Russell 3000® Indexes.

 “Arrive AI’s addition to the Russell 2000® and 3000® Indexes elevates our visibility within the broader institutional investment community and showcases our positively disruptive strategy to revolutionize last mile delivery with smart mailboxes and a Mailbox-as-a-Service, or MaaS, platform,” said Arrive AI Founder and CEO Dan O’Toole. “It also enhances our credibility and widens participation across the investing spectrum. This is a huge, galvanizing milestone that validates everything that we have worked for and that we continue to reach for every, single day. This means that Arrive AI is one of the 3,000 largest publicly traded companies, and that is gratifying beyond words.”

 The Russell Indexes are among the most widely used benchmarks for U.S. small-cap equities by the investment community, spanning diverse asset classes and investment objectives. Inclusion opens access to a broad base of institutional investors, index funds and ETFs that track these benchmarks, supporting increased liquidity and long-term shareholder value.

 ARAI’s ranking is based on the company’s market capitalization, financial performance and growth trajectory.
