# Q&amp;A with Harshith Vaddiparthy, Head of Growth at JustPaid

Harshith Vaddiparthy is the Head of Growth at JustPaid. JustPaid is the AI-powered revenue automation platform built for B2B companies. From invoicing to collections, JustPaid helps startups automate financial workflows, gain deep revenue insights, and scale without engineering effort. Backed by Y Combinator, JustPaid powers some of the most innovative companies redefining their industries.

 You’ve said AI is becoming ‘the front door to enterprise software.’ How do you envision this shift changing the way finance teams work in the next 2–3 years?

 AI is replacing complex dashboards with natural conversation. Instead of clicking through five different screens to check payment status, finance teams just ask: “Which invoices are overdue?”

 In 2-3 years, finance professionals will spend 70% less time on manual tasks and focus entirely on strategic decisions. At JustPaid, we’re already seeing this shift. Teams using our AI Agent spend their mornings asking questions, not opening spreadsheets.

 The AI Agent and the AI Reminder Bot, both bring a real-time, conversational layer to finance workflows. What were the biggest user pain points you were trying to solve with these features?

 The biggest pain was fragmentation. Finance teams were juggling CRMs, accounting software, email platforms, and spreadsheets with no connection between them.

 Our AI Billing Agent solves this by understanding full customer context. It has different personas depending on the situation. For a first reminder, it’s friendly and helpful. For overdue payments, it becomes more assertive but still professional. The AI knows payment history, relationship status, and even industry context when crafting messages.

 Users love that they never have to write another collection email or wonder which customers need follow-up.

 With so many companies claiming to ‘automate finance,’ what makes JustPaid’s approach to intelligent automation fundamentally different?

 Most automation breaks when something unexpected happens. JustPaid’s AI actually thinks through problems.

 When a customer pays 80% of an invoice, traditional software throws an error. Our AI understands this might be a disputed line item, researches the invoice history, and either resolves it automatically or escalates with full context.

 We’re automating decision-making, not just task execution. The AI handles exceptions intelligently instead of kicking everything back to manual mode.

 JustPaid recently embraced a product-led growth (PLG) model. What have you learned so far about how finance teams prefer to explore and adopt tools today?

 Finance teams want to see results with their actual data, not sit through demos. They start with one specific pain point, usually collections or invoicing, and expand from there.

 We’re seeing 85% trial-to-paid conversion rates because users can immediately test our AI Agent with real invoices. Once they see their DSO improve by 20-25%, they become advocates who naturally expand usage.

 The PLG model lets teams prove value in weeks, not months.

 You’ve made AI a core part of the user journey—from onboarding to compliance reminders. How do you balance automation with the need for human nuance in financial decision-making?

 We use “graduated automation.” The AI handles routine decisions confidently but escalates complex situations with full context.

 Our AI Billing Agent can send the first two collection reminders automatically. But when it detects signals that a customer might be struggling financially, it immediately involves the human team with a complete briefing.

 Users get granular control over automation boundaries. Some want AI to handle small invoices autonomously but require human approval for large accounts. The key is transparency: users always see why the AI made each decision.

 Can you share any early results or user insights that show how the AI Agent is driving adoption, retention, or operational efficiency?

 The numbers are compelling:

 * 45% reduction in time spent on AR processes
* 15-25% DSO improvement in the first quarter
* 85% trial-to-paid conversion rate
* Founders are saving 10-15 hours per week on collections and invoicing tasks

 The behavioral shift is most telling: finance teams now start their day checking in with the AI Agent instead of opening spreadsheets. When one person in a finance team starts using JustPaid, we typically see 2-3 additional users from the same company join within 90 days.

 The upcoming JustPaid Marketplace sounds like a game-changer. What kinds of apps or services are you most excited to see emerge from this ecosystem?

 Three categories excite us most:

 * Industry-specific tools: Construction companies need lien management, SaaS companies need subscription revenue recognition, professional services need project-based billing. The Marketplace lets specialists build these on our AI infrastructure.
* Cross-functional integrations: Apps that bridge finance with other departments, like automated purchase order approvals that understand budget constraints.
* Predictive services: Third-party apps that leverage our transaction data for credit risk assessment, cash flow forecasting, and market trend analysis.

 The magic happens when these apps communicate through our AI Agent, creating a unified financial intelligence system.

 How do you see the Marketplace impacting the role of financial service providers—like accountants and fractional CFOs—in a world where software is increasingly intelligent and autonomous?

 It’s elevating them, not replacing them. Accountants and CFOs are moving from data entry to strategic advisory roles.

 A fractional CFO who could previously serve 3-4 companies can now use our AI Agent to monitor cash flow across dozens of clients, getting alerts only when intervention is needed. They’re building “playbooks” that the AI executes while they focus on high-level strategy.

 The providers who embrace AI as a force multiplier will dramatically expand their reach. Those who resist will find themselves competing with increasingly sophisticated automation.

 You’ve described JustPaid as becoming the ‘central nervous system’ of B2B finance. What does success look like when that vision is fully realized?

 Success means finance teams operate at a fundamentally different level. They spend less than 20% of their time on manual processes, with the AI Agent handling all routine transactions while humans focus on strategic decisions.

 Every financial interaction flows through JustPaid’s intelligence layer. When a sales rep updates a deal in Salesforce, the AI automatically adjusts invoicing schedules, updates cash flow projections, and prepares collection strategies.

 The ultimate goal is proactive financial management. The AI should predict cash flow issues before they occur and recommend strategic decisions based on comprehensive financial intelligence.

 If you could give one piece of advice to finance leaders who are hesitant to adopt AI, what would it be?

 Start small, but start now. Pick one task that costs your team 2-3 hours per week, like chasing invoice approvals or crafting collection emails. Test AI on that single workflow for 30 days.

 The hesitation usually comes from fear of losing control, but AI actually gives you more control. You get complete visibility into every decision and can start with high oversight, gradually increasing automation as you build confidence.

 The finance leaders who embrace AI now will have a significant competitive advantage. Those who wait will find themselves trying to catch up in a marketplace where AI-powered efficiency is the baseline expectation.
