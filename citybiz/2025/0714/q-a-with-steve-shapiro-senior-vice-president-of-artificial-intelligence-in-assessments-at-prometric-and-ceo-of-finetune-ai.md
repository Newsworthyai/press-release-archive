# Q&amp;A with Steve Shapiro, Senior Vice President of Artificial Intelligence in Assessments at Prometric and CEO of Finetune AI

Steve Shapiro is the Senior Vice President of Artificial Intelligence in Assessments at Prometric and CEO of Finetune AI, a Prometric-owned technology company acquired in 2022. Finetune AI specializes in AI-assisted assessment and learning solutions across credentialing, licensure, workforce readiness, and education. In his role, Shapiro develops highly innovative, patent-pending technology involving AI-enabled products that can organically and creatively produce new content and intelligently classify and meta-tag content.

 A serial entrepreneur and three-time founder in the edtech and workforce training sectors, Shapiro brings a deep understanding of how technology can transform the way people learn and grow professionally. He is actively involved in the startup ecosystem as a member of Launchpad Venture Group and Cornell Red Bear Angel Group, and as a partner with LearnLaunch, a leading edtech accelerator in Boston.

 What is Prometric, and what role does it play in the education and assessment space?

 Prometric is the world’s largest credentialing, assessment, and skills development company. We work with organizations responsible for credentialing in healthcare, finance, insurance and many other industries where that credential is the gold standard for performance. Prometric also partners with those organizations to provide psychometric and test-development expertise and services.

 What is Finetune AI, and how does it fit into Prometric’s overall business and strategy?

 Finetune AI, Prometric’s proprietary AI solution, is redefining the development of assessments to make them increasingly secure, scalable, and psychometrically sound. We were the first company in our industry granted early access to Large Language Models at OpenAI. This allowed us to begin the research to invent our two core solutions, Finetune Generate® and Finetune Catalog; to file for patents; and to bring these solutions to market. Most of our core markets and customers have benefited from the additional innovation that Finetune AI brings to the process of creating, delivering and scoring assessments. Its early adoption of AI has helped us solidify Prometric’s position as the most innovative company in the credentialing industry

 You’re a three-time edtech founder and longtime entrepreneur. What has it been like leading AI initiatives inside a large, global organization?

 In most cases, the founder does not stick around too long after an acquisition by a larger company because they chafe at some of the bureaucracy of a larger organization. That has not been my experience at Prometric. In some respects, I have had the chance to “have my cake and eat it too,” as I have been given the directive to have our team continually innovate while at the same time having access to many worldwide known brands and organizations as clients. Prometric’s unique position across so many industries has given us access to a “who’s who” of important partners/clients to work with and apply the new features and functionality. Plus, I really love the people I work with.

 Finetune AI was an early mover in the generative AI space. How is its approach different from other entrants?

 We have a uniquely experienced team that has been working with generative AI longer than almost anyone on the planet. This gives Prometric a clear advantage as the underlying technology evolves, which happens literally every week. Our team consistently identifies the most effective ways to leverage these advances. Whether it’s the introduction of GPTs, retrieval-automated generation (RAG), finetuning, or agentic approaches, we’ve led the way in integrating new technologies into our product roadmap.

 How is AI changing the K–12 education landscape, and what role is Prometric playing in that evolution?

 AI is still in its early stages in K-12 education. Some first movers have found clever ways to use tools like ChatGPT to create content or automate some tasks. Over the next two to three years, I expect we’ll see more widespread implementation and groundbreaking advances. But, like most things in education, this will take time and we all need to step back and think about research-based approaches that make sense. Prometric is committed to thoughtful innovation and helping school leadership explore the responsible use of AI to improve instruction, assessment, and outcomes.

 Can you provide a real-world example of how Prometric’s AI tools are being used in schools today?

 One example is our Finetune Catalog solution, which – in minutes – helps district administrators evaluate their entire curriculum and instructional materials. It generates an actionable “report card” showing how well materials align with state standards and highlights areas that may benefit from enhancements – like providing various levels of differentiation. This level of insight supports more informed decision-making and helps schools ensure instructional quality.

 Some educators feel overwhelmed by emerging technologies. What is Prometric doing to promote AI literacy and build confidence among educators?

 It is part of our way of operating. We know that AI, at this point, is far enough along to be impactful. What needs to advance for it to be optimally used is the user. This is not a criticism at all, just a call to action that any human being using AI needs to first understand some of the basics around AI literacy. That is a journey from literate to fluent to proficient. This includes knowing when and how to use AI based on the task.

 What are the ethical considerations of using AI in the classroom and how does Prometric approach them?

 One of the core ethical considerations is understanding how the AI was built or amended for a specific use case. Transparency around the design and how it operates is essential. At Prometric, we believe this begins with AI literacy. By equipping educators and other stakeholders with a shared understanding and common vocabulary, we enable more informed, responsible use of AI and help ensure the power and benefits are realized in a thoughtful way.

 How can AI enhance teaching and learning, when applied thoughtfully?

 AI can support teachers by differentiating instruction, generating lesson plans and instructional materials, and streamlining assessment. It can also provide students with faster feedback than a teacher might be able to. In the best case, AI acts as a teaching assistant, freeing educators to spend more time facilitating learning and engaging directly with students.

 How can educational institutions and technology providers forge responsible AI partnerships that prioritize student outcomes?

 Trust and transparency are imperative. Both parties must also commit to being true “design partners,” working collaboratively so that there is a shared understanding of goals, challenges, and opportunities. Together, you are on a journey of learning how to architect a good user experience that optimally supports student outcomes, both today and into the rapidly changing future.

 What excites you most about Prometric’s future and your role in shaping it?

 It is such an exciting time to be part of Prometric. We’re uniquely positioned with our entry into K-12 education and our leadership position in the adult licensure and certification space. Our vision is to help learners of all ages move beyond their K-12 experience and navigate diverse pathways for continued education, upskilling, credentialing, and career growth. You hear so much about job loss or displacement due to AI, but I believe the future remains full of opportunity for those who are committed to continuous learning. In fact, “learning how to learn” may be the most important skill in the coming years.
