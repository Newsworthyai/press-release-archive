# AI Pharmacy Pioneer Asepha Raises $4M Led by Glasswing Ventures and Core Innovation Capital

Asepha, a fast-growing startup leveraging AI agents for pharmacy automation, today announced the close of its $4 million Seed round, led by Glasswing Ventures and Core Innovation Capital. Panache, RedBud, and MGV also participated, with follow-on support from Ripple Ventures and Front Row Ventures.

 Founded in 2023 by Eunice Wu and Can Uncu, who bring strong experience in pharmacy operations and AI engineering, Asepha began with a simple but urgent question: how can we leverage advances in agentic AI to solve bottlenecks across pharmacy care?

 Today, approximately 70% of pharmacies are understaffed, with pharmacists spending up to 90% of their valuable time on analog administrative work. Asepha is actively addressing these issues with a growing stack of interoperable agents that are streamlining pharmacy operations, speeding up workflows, and improving accuracy. Its suite of tools includes an OCR prescription entry agent, which interprets and processes complex, handwritten prescriptions with 96% accuracy, dramatically reducing manual data entry. It also features a call agent that automates up to 70% of inbound phone calls, streamlining requests and freeing up staff time. Meanwhile, Asepha’s browser navigation agent performs real-time web-based tasks, helping pharmacies manage administrative workflows with greater speed and precision. Validation experiments show pharmacists preferred Asepha’s AI responses over a human pharmacist’s responses 71% of the time in a double-blinded randomized trial.

 With this latest round of funding, Asepha will continue growing its engineering and go-to-market teams, as well as globally expand partnerships and its U.S. footprint with the opening of a New York City office. The company has already secured multiple major Fortune 50 enterprise customers, establishing its early importance in the space.

 “As a pharmacist, I experienced firsthand how much of our time is consumed by manual tasks that pull us away from patient needs. Asepha allows care teams to focus on what matters most, the people we serve. This funding allows us to scale that vision and bring meaningful relief to an overstretched workforce.” said Eunice Wu, CEO and Co-Founder of Asepha, “Our products are moving the needle in one of healthcare’s most operationally complex environments, improving access for tens of millions of patients along the way.”

 Can Uncu, CTO and Co-Founder, added, “AI is fundamentally restructuring industry workflows. We’re building the safety infrastructure and validation frameworks necessary for responsible pharmaceutical AI deployment through strategic research collaborations.”

 Wu is a Doctor of Pharmacy with experience working in various hospitals and retail pharmacies across Canada. Uncu previously worked at AMD on the MI300X chip, which powers OpenAI and Microsoft Azure today.

 “Eunice and Can recognize the transformative power AI Agents will have on verticalized industries such as pharmaceuticals,” said Rudina Seseri, Founder and Managing Partner at Glasswing Ventures. “By building an agentic API that does not require learning new interfaces or workflows, Asepha circumvents the common hurdles when introducing traditional software technology to highly regulated industries, while powering frictionless adoption. We are excited to be leading this financing round and to partner with Asepha as it drives efficiency gains without disruption.”

 “Asepha reflects two key theses we believe in. First, the companies most likely to find early success in today’s market will start with a tightly focused wedge that is both verticalized and use-case specific, rather than trying to serve everyone or everything from the outset,” said Edwin Loredo, Partner at Core Innovation Capital, “Second, some of the earliest and most scalable wins will come where technology aligns with macro and demographic trends. In Asepha’s case, they are helping to fill the massive supply-demand gap in pharmacy labor. That alignment not only creates real urgency, but also makes the go-to-market motion far more natural.”
