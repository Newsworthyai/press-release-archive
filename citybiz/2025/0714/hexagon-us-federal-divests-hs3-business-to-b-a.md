# Hexagon US Federal Divests HS3 Business to B&amp;A

As first announced on 2 July 2025, Hexagon US Federal, a mission-driven leader in advanced technology solutions for government and industry partners divested of its Strategic Services & Solutions business to Bart & Associates. This asset transaction represents a deliberate step toward streamlining operations and aligning the company with its long-term vision to deliver cutting-edge software, hardware, and value-added products supporting defense, intelligence, and federal-civilian critical missions across public safety, geospatial-intelligence, sensors & systems, and position, navigation, and timing (PNT).

 “A sincere and humble ‘thank you’ to those employees and missions being transitioned from Hexagon US Federal to B&A during this asset divestiture – you have been an integral part of building the company’s culture and success for decades. With great excitement, I look forward to the future of Hexagon US Federal being a more focused technology provider across multiple platforms, domains, and customers supporting our Nation’s most critical national security challenges,” said Chris Reichert, President and CEO of Hexagon US Federal.

 The HS3 business is recognized for delivering innovative and dependable professional services and solutions supporting the US Federal market including IT services, geospatial services, and integrated solutions enabling cyber assurance and situational awareness. Now, under the ownership of B&A, the HS3 business joins a company with a strong legacy of supporting the federal government through mission-critical modernization.

 As customer missions and technology demands grow increasingly complex, Hexagon US Federal is sharpening its portfolio to effectively address the critical challenges facing today’s defense and intelligence sector agencies and systems integrators. By concentrating on product innovation and as-a-service delivery, public safety support to All Hazards missions, and cutting-edge hardware from sensors to PNT solutions, the company will deliver greater mission agility, improved decision-making, and enhanced operational success across domains.
