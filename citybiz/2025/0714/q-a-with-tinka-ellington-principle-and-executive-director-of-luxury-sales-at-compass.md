# Q&amp;A with Tinka Ellington, Principle and Executive Director of Luxury Sales at Compass

Tinka Ellington, a real estate expert with 12 years of experience in South Florida, is the Executive Director of Luxury Sales for Salato Pompano Beach with Compass. She specializes in luxury coastal properties. Originally from Germany, Ellington began her entrepreneurial journey at 18 in the online and marketing industry. Her team has closed more than $280 million in sales, specializing in waterfront, coastal and new construction developments like Salato Pompano Beach.

 Salato Residences, at 305 Briny Ave., is a luxury boutique condominium with 40 residences, including six penthouses. It is scheduled for completion in early 2026. Designed by Randall Stofft Architects with interiors by Steven G., Salato features privacy, expansive terraces and resort-style amenities. Individual residences at Salato range from 2,106 to 3,354 square feet and feature open floorplans with extra wide living spaces and incredibly rare 14-foot-deep terraces that range from 320 to 746 square feet. Features include floor-to-ceiling windows that provide gorgeous views of the Atlantic Ocean, direct beach access, and over 20,000 square feet of amenities designed to feel like a world-class luxury resort.

 Salato Pompano Beach also just reached a pivotal milestone with the topping off of construction at the project, bringing the dream of boutique luxury oceanside living in the booming city that is much closer to becoming reality. The combination of intimacy, single-family feel and amenities is driving substantial sales activity at Salato. The project is about to reach 60% sold, with local, out-of-state and international buyers recognizing that Salato offers the premier oceanfront living experience in Pompano Beach.

 You mentioned that Salato is “the only walkable property to be delivered next year.” Can you elaborate on what makes Salato so uniquely walkable and the timeline for its delivery?

 Yes, Salato is truly unique in its walkability. Our prime location means residents are just steps away from the pristine shoreline and within easy walking distance to various local attractions, dining and retail options, including the Pompano Pier. This level of immediate access to the vibrant Pompano Beach lifestyle sets us apart. We are excited to announce that Salato Pompano Beach is scheduled for delivery in early 2026, making it the premier walkable oceanfront property available next year.

 Pompano Beach is experiencing a development boom. Can you speak to the synergy between the city and the developers, and how this collaborative environment benefits a project like Salato, especially given Pompano Beach was voted “best investment city in Florida”?

 The collaborative spirit in Pompano Beach is truly remarkable. There’s a strong synergy between city officials and developers, working hand-in-hand for the betterment of the city. This partnership has been instrumental in the success of projects like Salato. The city is actively investing in infrastructure and beautification, with initiatives like the Pompano Phase 1 being developed. This proactive approach, coupled with Pompano Beach being voted the best investment city in Florida, creates a dynamic and thriving environment that directly benefits Salato residents by enhancing their property value and overall quality of life.

 How does the boutique nature of Salato benefit residents compared to larger, brand-name developments?

 The boutique design fosters a tight-knit, residential community where people live and play, creating a more personalized and neighborly atmosphere. This approach also keeps costs low, as there’s less overhead compared to sprawling, brand-name developments, while still delivering luxury and quality. Salato purposely opted against licensing a brand name to keep HOA fees attractive, however has implemented services and experiences that are on par with other branded residences in the region. Forty units means you’re not dealing with many people at the pool or amenities, elevators, etc, creating an overall more private and luxurious feeling than a mass condo.

 One of the primary concerns for prospective buyers in Florida is flood risk. Can you speak to Salato Pompano Beach’s location and how it addresses concerns about being in a flood zone and elevation levels?

 A key advantage of Salato Pompano Beach is its favorable positioning. We are pleased to confirm that Salato is not labeled by FEMA to be in a flood zone, offering residents an added layer of security and peace of mind. Furthermore, the property boasts a higher elevation level compared to many other coastal developments, which significantly enhances its resilience, especially during challenging weather conditions and significantly reduces our insurance fees for the building. This is very rare for any coastal community in South Florida.

 Florida’s hurricane season is a reality. How is Salato Pompano Beach designed and constructed to withstand hurricanes, and what assurances can buyers have regarding the building’s integrity?

 Salato Pompano Beach has been built to the highest standards of new construction, specifically designed with Florida’s climate in mind. This includes being built to code, meaning there’s no worry about future assessments for code upgrades that have plagued older condominium buildings. The construction incorporates top-standard materials and engineering to ensure maximum resilience during hurricane season, such as top-of-the-line, highest-rated Hurricane Impact windows and concrete construction throughout, providing residents with confidence in the building’s structural integrity. Additionally, our residences start on the third floor of the structure offering an added buffer of safety.

 There have been stories surrounding older condo buildings and unexpected assessments. How does Salato Pompano Beach, as a new construction, address these concerns for buyers?

 This is precisely where new construction like Salato offers a distinct advantage. Because Salato Pompano Beach is new construction, built with the latest codes and top standards, there’s no worry about unexpected assessments for major structural repairs or code upgrades that have been a significant issue for older buildings in the region. Buyers can invest with confidence, knowing their investment is in a meticulously built property that meets and exceeds current safety and building regulations.

 How does Compass’s expertise contribute to the success of Salato Pompano Beach?

 As the No. 1 brokerage in condo sales in this market, Compass brings unmatched expertise and a proven track record to Salato. Our team, led by professionals like myself, ensures buyers receive top-tier guidance, leveraging our deep knowledge of the local market to make Salato a standout choice for investors and residents alike.
