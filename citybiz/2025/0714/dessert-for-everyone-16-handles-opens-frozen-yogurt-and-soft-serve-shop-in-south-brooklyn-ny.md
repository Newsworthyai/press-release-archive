# Dessert for Everyone: 16 Handles Opens Frozen Yogurt and Soft Serve Shop in South Brooklyn, NY

16 Handles, the beloved New York City self-serve frozen yogurt brand known for its unique flavors and premium soft serve, will debut a shop in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn on July 26, 2025. The new spot, at 300 Court St., aims to be the top community-driven destination for frozen yogurt and desserts.

 The shop is owned by franchisees Eric Farber and Dylan Vas, who met at Rutgers over a decade ago and bonded over business ideas, big dreams—and frozen yogurt. Now, 12 years later, that friendship has turned into a bold entrepreneurial leap with the opening of their first 16 Handles in the heart of Cobble Hill.

 As foodies and longtime fans of the brand, Eric and Dylan saw a sweet spot in the Brooklyn market with strong demand from families looking for a neighborhood gathering place. Their new shop, just over 1,000 square feet with both indoor and outdoor seating, will employ 15 local team members and aims to become a staple for Cobble Hill families.

 Eric spent eight years at JP Morgan and is currently pursuing an MBA at Columbia Business School. Dylan is a Senior Manager at a leading multinational consulting firm, where he has spent nine years supporting a portfolio of media, entertainment, and platform clients. The duo plans to expand further into Brooklyn and Queens, bringing more 16 Handles locations to neighborhoods that value community just as much as flavor.

 “16 Handles has that rare blend of suburban warmth and city edge,” Eric and Dylan said. “We want to build something where kids can make memories, parents can unwind, and neighbors can just hang out together over a cup of something fun.”

 A Grand Opening event is set for July 26, 2025 with free frozen yogurt for the first 100 guests, half-price treats thereafter, and other discounts throughout the evening and weekend.

 16 Handles features 16 soft serve flavors accompanied by over 50 premium toppings and sauces, as well as a variety of frozen novelties such as cakes, take-home pints, and DŌ gourmet edible cookie dough. Soft serve flavors range from vegan, nonfat, and no sugar added frozen yogurt to rich and creamy ice cream. The brand pushes the boundaries of innovation, with recent limited-edition flavor launches including Dubai Chocolate, Mango Lassi, French Fry, Butter Beer, Coconut Lemon Saffron, and Keto Chocolate Brownie, alongside staples like Classic Vanilla, Original Tart, and Made with Nutella. Modern store design with lounge-style seating and late-night hours makes 16 Handles the perfect dessert destination for families, friends, and dates.
