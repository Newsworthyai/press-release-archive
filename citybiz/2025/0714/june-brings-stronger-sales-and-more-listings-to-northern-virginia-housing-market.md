# June Brings Stronger Sales and More Listings to Northern Virginia Housing Market

Northern Virginia’s housing market showed renewed strength in June as a wave of new listings helped meet buyer demand and drive year-over-year gains in both home sales and total transaction volume, according to the Northern Virginia Association of Realtors. The number of homes sold in June 2025 climbed to 1,847 — a 13.6% increase over June 2024. As more transactions closed, total sold dollar volume reached more than $1.64 billion, marking a 15.2% gain from the previous year.

 Inventory was the key driver of this growth. Active listings jumped 52.7% year-over-year, reaching 2,512 properties on the market. This helped push the months of supply to 1.84, a 46.5% increase compared to June 2024, giving buyers more breathing room than in recent years.

 While buyer activity was strong, increased inventory also brought slight shifts in pricing and pace. The median sold price in June 2025 dipped 1.3% year-over-year to $770,000. Homes stayed on the market for an average of 20 days, a 42.9% increase from the previous year. Together, these trends point to a market that is normalizing — offering buyers more flexibility while encouraging sellers to align with evolving conditions.

 “We view this as a healthy recalibration,” said NVAR CEO Ryan McLaughlin. “Buyers have more time to make informed decisions. Pricing is stabilizing after years of intense upward pressure. These are all indicators of a maturing, resilient market that is adjusting to new conditions without losing momentum.”

 This summer, buyers in the region are taking a more measured approach, reflecting a transition toward a more balanced market environment. “The difference this year is options,” said NVAR Board Member Veronica Seva-Gonzalez, Compass. “Buyers aren’t rushing into the first available home; they’re able to take a breath, compare choices, and still act competitively when the right property comes along. It’s a more thoughtful market, and that’s good for everyone. While some markets have seen inventory improve, competition remains fierce in some of the most sought-after areas, where well-priced homes are still receiving multiple offers.”

 Looking ahead, NVAR anticipates steady market activity, particularly if more homeowners choose to list their properties. With conditions gradually balancing and opportunities expanding, the region is well-positioned for continued resilience in the months ahead.

 “Northern Virginia’s economic stability, excellent schools, and overall quality of life remain major draws,” McLaughlin said. “If more sellers enter the market, we anticipate strong performance across the region for the rest of the year.”
