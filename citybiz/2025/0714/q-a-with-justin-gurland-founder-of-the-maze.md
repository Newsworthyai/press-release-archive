# Q&amp;A with Justin Gurland, Founder of The Maze

Meet The Maze – New York City’s first alcohol-free members’ social club, opening this fall in Flatiron. It’s a space that’s redefining how New Yorkers gather, connect, and build community – with intention, not alcohol, at the center.

 Spanning 4,600 square feet at 43 West 24th Street, The Maze is modern mindfulness brought to life – an elevated, beautifully designed hub for professionals, creatives, and the sober/sober-curious seeking purpose-driven events, genuine connection, and wellness-first socializing.

 The visionary behind it is Justin Gurland, a Licensed Master Social Worker who has been sober for 17 years and has spent his career in recovery, mental health, and community-building. After two decades in the field, Justin saw a gap: the need for spaces where sobriety is celebrated – not stigmatized – and where wellness doesn’t feel clinical. The Maze is his answer.

 Our goal is to create a space that feels aspirational, not restrictive. A place where people come not because they can’t drink, but because they don’t have to. That’s the kind of energy we want to bring into this moment.

 Inside The Maze, members will find a chic New American restaurant, a high-end coffee bar, intimate lounge areas, and flexible event spaces – all intentionally designed to foster connection and community. The club will offer curated cultural programming, elevated social gatherings, and Justin’s favorite: the monthly Cornerstone Dinner, a signature evening centered around meaningful conversation (and delicious food!).

 What is The Maze, and how do you envision it serving the NYC community?

 At its core, The Maze is an alcohol-free members club – but it’s so much more than that. It’s the first of its kind, and I truly believe it will be something our members didn’t even realize they were missing. I imagine people walking in and thinking, “Where has this been my whole life?” Even outside of the alcohol-free space, we’re living in a time where loneliness is widespread.

 So many of our interactions are mediated by screens, and real connection has become harder to come by. And whether we like it or not, alcohol has become a social crutch. When you take it out of the equation, connecting with others can feel intimidating or awkward – especially in a city like New York. The Maze exists to change that. It’s a space for genuine human connection – for community, conversation, and shared experiences.

 And while it will be an incredible resource for those who are alcohol-free, it’s really for anyone who’s seeking something deeper than the typical nightlife or social scene. We’re building a home for people who want more – and we believe it will serve a real need in the NYC community.

 The Maze isn’t just about sobriety – it’s about connection. How do you plan to foster real community in a city like New York?

 Bringing people together is truly my passion. I’ve always believed that we’re all connected in some way – and that when you cross paths with someone, there’s a reason for it. If The Maze can be the space where those meaningful intersections happen – where people connect who might never have otherwise – that’s a win.

 Our mission isn’t about selling as many memberships as possible. It’s about building real community. We want members to feel like they’re part of something bigger – something rooted in authenticity, shared values, and genuine connection. And there’s no better place for this than New York City.

 I’ve always been in love with this city – its energy, its diversity, its edge. There’s something about New York that makes it the perfect home for The Maze. It’s a city full of people searching for something real, and we’re here to offer them a place to find it.

 Can you share a bit on the name, The Maze?

 After an exhausting search for the right name, The Maze came to me when I least expected it – exactly how it was meant to happen. I was driving, and the Phish song “Maze” came on. I’d probably heard it a thousand times during the months I was brainstorming, but for some reason, that moment was different. It just hit me. Beyond the music connection – which was important to me personally – the word maze started to take on deeper meaning. Life can feel like a maze. Sobriety, New York City, adulthood, even just figuring out who you are – it’s all confusing and often overwhelming.

 What inspired you to become a social worker, and how has your personal recovery journey shaped your approach to the work?

 When I got sober at 25 years old, I was feeling incredibly lost. I had checked a lot of boxes – graduated college, lived independently – but I lacked a real sense of purpose. Recovery gave me that. It introduced me to mentors who made a huge impact on my life, and I felt a deep pull to give back in some way.

 With their encouragement, I applied to graduate school for social work. From the moment I started, I knew I had found the right path. My personal recovery journey has been foundational – not just in leading me to the field, but in shaping how I approach the work. In social work school, there’s a strong emphasis on avoiding self-disclosure.

 But I’ve always believed that, when used appropriately, my lived experience can be an asset. It helps build trust, deepen connection, and offer hope. It may not be the traditional approach, but for me, it’s been an authentic and effective one.

 What gaps or needs did you notice in the wellness and recovery space that ultimately led to the creation of The Maze?

 In the world of early recovery, so much attention is understandably focused on crises – overdoses, legal issues, DUIs – those intense qualifying events that often push someone to seek help. But what often gets overlooked is what happens after. Recovery doesn’t just impact the individual – it affects the entire family system. It’s chaotic, emotional, and complex.

 One question I heard time and time again, often too early in the process, was: “What will life look like later? Will I have fun again? Will I find my people?” At the time, I’d often say, “We’re not there yet” – and that was true. But I never forgot how important that question was. Because the truth is, community is often what makes the difference between someone who stays on the path and someone who doesn’t. That sense of belonging, of having a tribe, is vital.

 When I reached a point of transition in my own life, I asked myself how I could stay rooted in the alcohol-free world while also building something that answered that question. That’s what led to the creation of The Maze. A place not just for people in recovery, but for anyone seeking meaningful connection without alcohol. A place that offers a future – not just a past.

 [](https://www.citybiz.co/attachment/the-maze-1/) [](https://www.citybiz.co/attachment/the-maze-2-copy/) What’s been the most surprising part of launching The Maze so far? What are you most excited about – and most nervous about – as you prepare to open this fall?

 What’s surprised me most so far is the community that’s already taken shape – even before we’ve opened our doors. Our waitlist is approaching 2,000 people, which has been incredibly humbling. But beyond the public interest, what’s meant the most is the team we’ve built. Dan, our SVP of Membership, and I started dreaming about this almost two years ago, and watching it unfold together has been surreal. We’ve brought on incredible people – Taryn Weiss, our design partners Aria Jahanshahi and Adrienne Laube, and our amazing contractors at De Lux Construction – who have all become like family.

 And our restaurant operator, who we’ll be announcing soon, will be the cherry on top. The energy around this team feels like an omen for what’s to come. Of course, there are nerves. This is all new to me. I’ve worked in recovery and social work for years, but launching a space like this is a new path entirely. New things can be scary – but with the right people around you, the possibilities really are endless.

 There’s growing momentum around alcohol-free spaces and sober-curious living. How does The Maze fit into that cultural shift?

 I truly believe we’re entering at exactly the right time. There’s a real cultural shift happening – more people are questioning their relationship with alcohol, exploring sober-curious living, and seeking spaces that support connection without the pressure to drink. The world, especially here in New York City, feels primed for something like this. The Maze fits right into that movement, and in many ways, we hope to help lead it. We’re not just riding the wave – we’re building infrastructure around it.

 Our goal is to create a space that feels aspirational, not restrictive. A place where people come not because they can’t drink, but because they don’t have to. That’s the kind of energy we want to bring into this moment. We’re also introducing a new American restaurant at the heart of The Maze – warm, inviting, and designed to be a destination in its own right. It’s complemented by our monthly Cornerstone Dinners, intimate evenings curated around thought-provoking themes, great food, and meaningful conversation. These experiences are about community, culture, and connection – all without alcohol at the center.

 What kind of legacy or ripple effect do you hope The Maze creates?

 As for legacy, I hope The Maze helps shift the conversation around sobriety, connection, and what it means to truly belong. I want it to be a place where people feel seen, welcomed, and inspired – regardless of why they walk through the door. If even one person feels less alone because of this space, that ripple is worth everything.

 But my vision goes beyond that. I want The Maze to be a place people genuinely want to be. Not because they have to be sober, but because they crave real connection, meaningful experiences, and community. I’m a big believer in the ripple effect – when people feel empowered and connected, they bring that energy into the world around them. That’s how culture shifts. And if The Maze can be a small spark that helps make that happen, that would be the greatest legacy of all.

 Anything else to share?

 Our applications will be available this month and we are thrilled to open our doors this fall. Please stay tuned to our social media @themazenyc for all updates!
