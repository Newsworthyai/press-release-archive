# The Atlantic Resiliency Innovation Institute’s Marshfield Coastal Academy Symposium Inspires Next Generation of Maritime Professionals

Summer session engages regional students in coastal resiliency strategy and career exploration

 Atlantic Resiliency Innovation Institute (ARII), a nonprofit organization focused on creating a science-based community to address coastal hazards and enhance regional resiliency, is pleased to announce the successful completion of its recent Marshfield Coastal Academy symposium.

 Held June 23-27, the event brought together a dozen 8th and 9th grade students from Hingham, Hull, Marshfield, and Scituate for immersive learning experiences focused on coastal resiliency, climate adaptation, and maritime career exploration. The symposium, led by Marshfield Coastal Academy Director Jeffrey Granatino and the Academy’s Lead Instructor Jim DeMaggio, provided students with valuable hands-on training and insight into real-world environmental challenges.

 Each day of the symposium centered on a distinct facet of coastal resilience, providing students with a deepening perspective on the complex issues facing and shaping shoreline communities. Highlights of the immersive week included a discussion with the Marshfield Harbormaster and a tour of the various coastal challenges facing the town, as well as an educational tour of the Cape Cod Canal and a visit to the Massachusetts State House, where students engaged directly with South Shore legislators on legislation and budget priorities related to the coastline. The itinerary also featured a visit to a major beach project taking place in Weymouth, a meeting with executives of Cashman Inc. in Quincy, lab experiments with staff at the Cohasset Center for Student Coastal Research, and an excursion on a research boat led by professors from Massachusetts Maritime Academy.

 The June symposium marks the second in a series hosted by the Marshfield Coastal Academy. The inaugural symposium, held in April, was also a great success, eliciting many positive comments from participating students and their parents.

 “Our symposiums aren’t just about teaching students the science of coastal resilience,” said Granatino. “It’s also about empowering them to see themselves as future leaders in protecting our shoreline communities. Watching their curiosity and their confidence grow over the week was nothing short of inspiring.”

 The application process for the inaugural Fall Cohort at Marshfield Coastal Academy, a 10-month program geared toward high school graduates, will be available soon.
