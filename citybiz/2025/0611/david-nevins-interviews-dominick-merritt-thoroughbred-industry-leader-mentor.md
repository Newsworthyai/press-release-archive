# David Nevins Interviews Dominick Merritt, Thoroughbred Industry Leader &amp; Mentor

Dominick Merritt‘s journey into the Thoroughbred industry is a testament to perseverance and passion. From watching the sport as a child in East Baltimore and developing a deep passion for it, Dominick’s introduction to the hands-on side of the equine world came through a connection at Harford Community College, which led him to an opportunity at Bonita Farm. There, he quickly absorbed every aspect of horsemanship, rapidly progressing from mucking stalls and grooming to galloping horses at Maryland tracks like Laurel and Pimlico. He eventually achieved his dream of becoming a full-time exercise rider for nationally acclaimed trainer Todd Pletcher, a role that has taken him to premier racing circuits across the United States and even Australia.

 In recognition of his remarkable ascent and commitment, Merritt received the prestigious Godolphin “Newcomer Award” at the Thoroughbred Industry Employee Awards in October 2023. Beyond his professional achievements, Dominick is deeply committed to giving back, serving as an inspiring mentor for Saddle Up Scholars, a Baltimore-based non-profit that introduces young people from low-income communities to horses and provides academic support. He is passionate about being a role model and showing that anything is possible with dedication and a strong work ethic.
