# Harford Community Action Agency Renames Food Pantry to the “Harford Food Bank”

The Harford Community Action Agency (HCAA) recently renamed its food pantry to the Harford Food Bank. The decision to rename the food pantry was made to highlight HCAA’s dedication to fighting hunger and supporting the Harford County community.

 To celebrate the renaming, HCAA hosted a breakfast celebration on May 13th to thank its stakeholders and showcase the food bank’s work. The event brought together nearly 100 elected officials, community leaders, and sponsors. The Harford County Council and Harford County Executive Bob Cassilly both presented proclamations during the event.

 “The Harford Food Bank name better represents our deep-rooted commitment to the community,” said HCAA CEO Pamela Craig. “Every hour, our food bank serves 13 Harford County residents. Our work would not be possible without the continued generosity of the community, and we’re eager to continue our mission of eliminating hunger in Harford County.”

 The platinum food bank sponsor, the Bel Air Lions Club, will have naming rights for the food bank for one year. Other key food bank sponsors include Rotary Clubs of Harford County and Maison Nord Farm.
