# CFHV Releases ‘Voices of the Hudson Valley’ Report Highlighting Hudson Valley Perspectives

Local insights will shape future Hudson Valley grantmaking opportunities

 Community Foundations of the Hudson Valley (CFHV) has released Voices of the Hudson Valley, its data-driven report that compiles valuable community conversations hosted in Dutchess, Putnam, and Ulster counties, synthesizing voices and feedback from the public to capture the themes, hopes, and concerns of the region’s residents with a county-by-county focus. The findings from this report will influence CFHV’s future grantmaking opportunities and involvement.

 “This is more than just a synopsis,” said Laura Washington, president & CEO of CFHV. “It’s a roadmap that will guide our work and help us build a stronger, more connected Hudson Valley. By amplifying the voices of our community, we can drive meaningful change together.”

 Within the report, CFHV identifies the perspectives of residents, nonprofit leaders, and business officials across the three counties it serves, detailing what residents love about their hometown and what pressing needs should be addressed.

 This regional snapshot reveals that the positive attributes of the Hudson Valley stem from its rich diversity in art and culture, encompassing everything from urban murals and centuries-old historic sites to its libraries, educational institutions, and the breathtaking beauty of its parks, trails, and protected waterbodies.

 In terms of the Hudson Valley’s pressing issues, CFHV identified some areas of concern including a need for housing, with homeownership out of reach and rent increasing, addressing food insecurity as the Food Bank of the Hudson Valley has almost doubled its distribution to its service area, and a shortage of resources to fight against the mental health and addiction crises. Additionally, families surveyed noted that childcare options in the Hudson Valley are dwindling, with fewer businesses in each county licensed, and finally, public transportation was noted as dire in rural areas, where people do not have walkable access to goods and services.

 Following the report release, CFHV plans to host panel discussions, bringing together experts from the community, who can lend their insights in each issue area. These public talks will connect community members with nonprofits and other organizations to learn more, volunteer, or donate to a cause they feel passionate about.

 CFHV emphasizes that this report serves not as a one-time initiative but as a catalyst for ongoing change. While this research allows CFHV to prioritize areas identified by the community, CFHV remains committed to addressing a broad range of issues. This research enhances understanding of residents’ perspectives and will facilitate stronger connections within the community as well as the administration and distribution of grants to nonprofits addressing the challenges area residents have deemed most critical.
