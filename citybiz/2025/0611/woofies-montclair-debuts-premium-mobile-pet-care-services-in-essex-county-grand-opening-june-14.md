# Woofie’s Montclair Debuts Premium Mobile Pet Care Services in Essex County, Grand Opening June 14

Woofie’s® Montclair, a leading provider of personalized mobile pet care services, is now proudly serving pets and their parents across Essex County, including Montclair, Upper Montclair, Caldwell, Glen Ridge, Bloomfield, Verona, Nutley, and nearby areas. Known for its rich culture, diversity, and deep love of pets, Essex County offers the perfect blend of urban and suburban living for this premier pet care brand.

 An independently owned and operated business—Woofie’s Montclair is led by General Manager Gabriela Cobos and Co-Owner Kristina Castro—brings a deeply personal, vet-informed, and compassionate approach to pet care and offers a full range of mobile pet services designed to meet pets where they are most comfortable. Services include mobile grooming, dog walking, and pet sitting. As part of its commitment to pet health and owner peace of mind, Woofie’s Montclair also provides 24/7 veterinary telehealth support through its partnership with Pet Vet Connection.

 Woofie’s Montclair is co-owned by Kristina Castro, who also serves as the company’s Chief Pet Officer. With a decade of experience in both veterinary care and retail/spa management, Kristina brings unmatched passion and leadership to the team.

 “Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of guiding pet parents through everything from joyful first puppy visits to emotional decisions,” said Castro. “Every experience has fueled my dedication to compassionate service and team leadership—and now I’m proud to bring that heart-centered care to families here in Essex County.”

 Castro resides in Bloomfield, NJ with wife, Jacquelyn, and their three beloved pets: Salamander Risotto, a blind domestic cat; Cholula Rye, a domestic shorthair, and Crumpet, a Shih Tzu.

 “As general manager, my role will be to combine my deep love for animals and my background in the veterinary field,” said Gabriela Cobos, who brings eight years of clinical veterinary experience. “After working hands-on with pets in medical settings, I saw the growing need for trusted, stress-free services that go beyond the vet’s office. That’s exactly what Woofie’s offers—and I knew I wanted to be part of it.”

 Gabriela is a resident of the area, along with wife, Anyssa, and is mom to Miko Mateo, a 10-month-old Lab mix, and Cameryn Michaels, a six-year-old Pitbull mix, as well as cat mom to three-year-old Rupaw.

 Woofie’s Montclair will celebrate its grand opening and the launch of its mobile van at Montclair Pride on June 14. Woofie’s will treat pups to free plum facials from noon to 2 p.m. Attendees can also take a turn at the Woofie’s spinning board to win fun prizes, and stop by the booth for dog treats, while time and supplies last.

 Woofie’s Montclair plans to participate in other upcoming events including the Montclair Farmers’ Market, Strut Your Mutt in October, and will host pop-up events in collaboration with local businesses at community parks throughout the fall.
