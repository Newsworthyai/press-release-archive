# Q&amp;A with Eric Stastny, COO of Emerson Health: Rethinking Workforce Strategy in a 24/7 Healthcare World

As hospitals across the country face growing challenges in retaining and supporting staff, Emerson Health’s Chief Operating Officer Eric Stastny believes it’s time to fundamentally rethink how healthcare systems approach their workforce. In this conversation, Stastny outlines why traditional models are no longer sufficient and how hospitals can evolve to meet the expectations of a new generation while maintaining the high standards of patient care.

 At Emerson Health, we’re embracing solutions like virtual counseling, peer support networks, and dedicated mindfulness rooms

 What’s changed about the healthcare workforce, and why does it matter now?

 The mission of hospitals hasn’t changed. We’re here to keep people healthy and save lives, 24/7. But the expectations of the people who do that work have shifted dramatically. Across every role, from the front desk to the surgical suite, we’re seeing new demands, especially from Gen Z professionals. Seventy-seven percent of them prioritize work-life balance, stress management, and healthy lifestyles. That expectation can clash with the reality of around-the-clock care. If we fail to adapt, we risk losing our most essential asset: our people. In fact, one in five healthcare workers employed in 2022 had left their organizations by 2023. This isn’t just a staffing issue. It’s a frontline operational challenge.

 How is Emerson Health approaching the idea of flexibility in such a structured environment?

 Flexibility in healthcare can’t simply mean offering remote work across the board. But it also can’t mean staying locked into rigid roles and schedules. At Emerson Health, we’re exploring options like self-scheduling tools that allow staff, especially nurses, to align their shifts with personal and family needs. We’re rethinking compensation and benefits to better support this flexibility. And we’re identifying which roles, like hybrid administrative positions or those tied to virtual care, can be redesigned to offer more adaptability without compromising patient care. It’s about moving beyond an outdated binary and recognizing that more creative solutions are possible.

 What role does technology, and especially AI, play in your workforce strategy?

 Technology isn’t about replacing people. It’s about supporting them. Generative AI and workflow tools are already proving their worth. Deloitte estimates they can reduce administrative workload by 50 percent for revenue-cycle staff and free up 20 percent of nurses’ time for direct patient care. That’s not just efficiency. It’s a real solution to burnout. We’re also seeing new positions emerge, like virtual imaging technicians who deliver diagnostics remotely. The point is to give caregivers more time to focus on what they’re trained to do. When deployed thoughtfully, technology enhances the human side of healthcare.

 What are you doing to better support mental health and well-being among staff?

 The emotional weight healthcare workers carry is enormous. We’ve moved far beyond the old approach of handing out EAP brochures. Today’s support systems must be holistic. At Emerson Health, we’re embracing solutions like virtual counseling, peer support networks, and dedicated mindfulness rooms. These aren’t perks. They’re necessities. According to Modern Health, organizations that offer these kinds of mental health supports see a 5.5 percent increase in retention among employees who use them. That’s a real return on investment, and a meaningful way to sustain the people who sustain us.

 Some might argue the traditional system has worked. Why change now?

 The cost of inaction is simply too high. High turnover, skyrocketing recruitment costs, dependence on temporary staff, and deteriorating workplace culture are signs that old models are breaking down. And we’re no longer just competing with other hospitals. We’re competing with industries that offer remote options, intuitive tech, and better professional development. According to SHRM, 92 percent of workers say growth opportunities significantly impact job satisfaction. In healthcare, too many jobs remain rigid with limited career pathways. At Emerson Health, we believe rethinking workforce strategy is not a compromise on care. It’s the evolution of how we deliver it. Because in the end, care begins with the caregiver.
