# Q&amp;A with Nate Chang, Chief Marketing Officer for Sequel Brands

Nate Chang is a seasoned marketing executive with nearly two decades of experience driving growth for some of the most recognizable names in the franchise industry. As Chief Marketing Officer of Sequel Brands, Chang leads brand strategy, creative direction and integrated marketing efforts across a diverse portfolio of health and wellness brands.

 His franchise marketing career began in food service with Del Taco and Rita’s Italian Ice, before pivoting into fitness with UFC GYM. There, he discovered his passion for helping people move and helping brands scale. Chang went on to lead transformational growth and rebranding efforts across multiple franchise concepts, including serving as chief marketing officer of YogaSix and CycleBar, the world’s largest indoor cycling brand.

 It’s not about chasing trends; it’s about staying culturally in tune, both nationally and locally. When done right, it reinforces trust in the brand and empowers franchisees to lead with confidence.

 One of Chang’s most notable achievements was spearheading the rebrand of YogaSix in 2018. Under his leadership, the brand expanded from 12 to over 200 locations in less than five years, becoming the largest yoga franchise globally.

 With a strategic yet adaptable approach, Chang is known for building culturally resonant brands that scale from early-stage concepts to national category leaders.

 How are you building individual brand identities while also establishing the Sequel Brands umbrella? We build each brand to stand on its own, with a clear identity, voice and purpose, while still connecting them through a shared vision. Sequel is about creating a modern ecosystem for movement, recovery and longevity. Our portfolio strategy is intentionally decentralized at the brand level and unified at the operational level. It’s not about uniformity, it’s about alignment. The umbrella gives us scale and strategic clarity, while each brand delivers a differentiated experience to its specific audience.

 

 In an increasingly crowded wellness market, how do you help franchisees differentiate themselves locally?

 We help our franchisees lead with brand authority and clarity. Each brand has a sharp point of view and our job is to translate that into local execution. We provide ready-to-deploy content, location-specific paid media, event strategies and messaging frameworks that are built to scale. We also encourage local partnerships and community-driven storytelling. Franchisees aren’t just selling a workout; they’re building relevance in a local wellness culture. That’s where differentiation actually happens.

 Are there opportunities for cross-brand marketing benefits across the Sequel portfolio for multi-unit owners?

 One of the strategic advantages of the Sequel model is the ability to connect complementary wellness concepts under one portfolio. For multi-unit owners, that opens the door to shared marketing efforts like cross-promoting studio openings, retargeting audiences across brands and creating bundled offers that drive trial between concepts. As we continue to grow, we see a lot of opportunities in building integrated campaigns that support the portfolio, not just the individual unit.

 

 What tools and resources do you provide to franchisees to support local marketing efforts?

 We operate like an in-house agency for our franchisees. Our job is to take the thinking out of it so they can focus on running their business. We deliver everything from brand-approved creative, automated local ads and email/SMS campaigns to plug-and-play content calendars and marketing launch kits. It’s not just access to assets, it’s strategic guidance, ongoing support and executional clarity. Franchisees shouldn’t have to figure out how to market, we work with them to provide the tools, messaging and structure to show up locally with confidence and consistency.

 How does your marketing approach differ for franchise development compared to consumer acquisition?

 Franchise development is a relationship and trust business. Consumer marketing is transactional where you’re trying to drive a booking to a conversion who will hopefully become your best organic brand ambassadors. For franchise sales, we lead with the founder’s vision, the strength of the category and proof of performance from existing operators. For consumers, it’s more about the day-to-day brand experience: how we can help you move, recover or perform better. Two totally different tracks with shared storytelling at the core.

 

 What marketing channels are proving most effective for franchise lead generation across your brands?

 We’re not just relying on traditional paid media, we’re actively expanding how and where we show up to reach the next wave of franchise owners. Of course, channels like Meta and Google are still in play, but we’re also exploring more strategic partnerships, brand experiences and thought leadership opportunities that align with where today’s operators are actually paying attention. Whether it’s investor-facing events, founder-led content on LinkedIn or aligning with wellness brands that already have trust and reach, we’re focused on building a pipeline that feels more targeted, relevant and values-driven. The goal isn’t just volume, it’s qualified interest from people who resonate with what we’re building.

 How is technology playing a role in franchise sales pipeline management and marketing attribution?

 We’ve centralized our sales infrastructure so we can see the full journey, from lead source to close. That means tighter attribution, cleaner reporting and better decision-making. We use real-time dashboards to monitor performance and refine campaigns in-market. The ability to map ROI across multiple channels and across brands is key as we scale and continue to grow.

 

 How do you ensure franchise marketing stays consistent while adapting to shifting consumer preferences?

 Brand consistency is foundational definitely. We want every touchpoint to reflect the quality, clarity and authority of a tier-one wellness brand. But within that structure, there must be room for local relevance. Our guidelines are designed to protect the integrity of the brand while giving franchisees the flexibility to make it their own. We provide the framework messaging, visuals, campaign strategy but also the tools to localize, personalize and respond to what’s happening in their communities. It’s not about chasing trends; it’s about staying culturally in tune, both nationally and locally. When done right, it reinforces trust in the brand and empowers franchisees to lead with confidence.
