# Levin Johnston Completes Sale of 49,922 Square-Foot, 568-Unit Extra Space Self-Storage Facility in Fremont, California

Levin Johnston of Marcus & Millichap, one of the top brokerage teams in the U.S. specializing in wealth management through commercial real estate investments, announces that it has closed the $18.775 million sale of a 49,922 square-foot, 568-unit Extra Space Storage facility in the Bay Area city of Fremont, California. Levin Johnston represented the seller, a private real estate investor, and procured the buyer, an institutional self-storage developer, operator, and manager, in the transaction, according to Adam Levin, Executive Managing Director of Levin Johnston.

 “The seller, who had previously invested in multifamily, held this high-quality, cash-flowing self-storage asset, professionally managed by Extra Space Storage, for five years,” explains Levin. “This provided stability during an uncertain and sometimes volatile period for the Bay Area. Leveraging favorable market momentum and heightened interest in the region, they saw value in trading back into multifamily assets supported by a strong economic base and enduring appeal of the area as a place to live and work.”

 He notes that the Levin Johnston team was able to bring additional value through leveraging its extensive network of investors for a varied and competitive buyer pool.

 Levin continues: “Drawing upon our deep experience with not only self-storage investors, but also multifamily and other asset-class owners seeking portfolio diversification and long-term value creation, we’re able to consistently bring a broader, motivated group of buyers to the table. In this case, that reach translated into a higher price per square foot, even at a lower cap rate, than recent comparables.”

 The trade is a win-win for the seller and the buyer, who was attracted to the opportunity to scale its Bay Area portfolio and pursue value-add enhancements to the asset down the line.

 Matthew McCaffrey, Self-Storage Specialist – Investment Associate at Levin Johnston, adds: “The buyer has a portfolio of over 80 owned and operated self-storage properties throughout the country, with several located in the Bay Area. As a firm specializing in self-storage and with expertise in development, the new owner is positioned to increase the asset’s value over the long term and take it to the next level to cater to the demand from surrounding populations.”

 McCaffrey adds that the Bay Area’s 65-year-plus population is expected to grow significantly in the coming years, providing a strong base population more likely to utilize self-storage facilities and drive demand.

 Robert Johnston, Executive Managing Director of Levin Johnston, says: “This transaction demonstrates the strength of self-storage as both an alternative and a complement to multifamily and other product types, depending on diversification and wealth-building goals. We’re focused on expanding our self-storage platform to continue capturing those opportunities for our clients.”

 The property is located in the heart of Fremont, which has been the beneficiary of strong economic drivers from local companies including Facebook and Tesla. Situated 1.5 miles from Downtown Fremont and in close proximity to several other major lifestyle amenities, it also enjoys easy access to major transportation corridors, transit, and rail systems including Interstate 680, Interstate 880, Dumbarton Bridge, ACE, Amtrak, and BART.

 Competitive property amenities include most units having drive-up access for easy loading and unloading for customers, controlled access gated entry, 24-hour closed circuit surveillance, and available moving supplies on site.

 The asset is located at 38491 Fremont Boulevard in Fremont, California. With this sale, the Levin Johnston team of Marcus & Millichap has completed 64 transactions with a total dollar volume of more than $370 million in 2025 to date.
