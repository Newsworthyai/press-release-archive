# Q&amp;A with Danny and Kathy Lisath, Franchise Owners of The Red Chickz Woodland

The newest The Red Chickz franchise location will be owned by husband-and-wife duo, Danny and Kathy Lisath. Both Veterans who met and fell in love during their time in the army, the Lisaths were looking to invest in a concept that would empower them to own their own business and build generational wealth for their family.

 It’s no secret that hot chicken is the next big thing in food and franchising. How did you narrow your options down, and what made The Red Chickz stand out to you as potential owners?

 When we started looking into franchise opportunities, we wanted something exciting, high-quality, and community-driven. The Red Chickz stood out immediately—the food is amazing, the energy is fun, and the brand felt fresh and family-oriented. We also appreciated how hands-on and supportive the corporate team was. Their values really aligned with ours, and we could see ourselves growing with the brand long-term.

 What intimidated you the most about franchising? Why choose now to jump in?

 The biggest challenge was just taking that leap of faith. Franchising can feel overwhelming at first with all the steps—financing, construction, permits—but we realized there’s never a “perfect time.” After years of talking about building something of our own, we decided to go for it and create something our family could be proud of.

 You mention in a recent press release that one of your main goals in this endeavor is to build generational wealth for your family. What are some other ways that Red Chickz serves as an investment in your future?

 Beyond financial stability, this business represents freedom and legacy. We want to show our kids what hard work, faith, and perseverance look like. It’s also about giving back—creating jobs in the community, offering growth opportunities for our team, and building relationships that last.

 Both of you met and fell in love during your time in the U.S. Army—how did your prior experience with serving the country prepare you for business ownership?

 Our military experience taught us discipline, teamwork, and resilience—skills that translate directly into business. The Army prepared us to lead with structure but also adapt when things don’t go as planned. Running a restaurant requires the same mindset: you lead from the front, care for your team, and keep pushing forward.

 Do you have plans to open more locations in or around Sacramento? If so, what areas would you be looking at?

 Yes, absolutely! Once Woodland is fully up and running, we’d love to expand into surrounding areas like Davis, Vacaville, or Roseville. Our goal is to grow smart—build a strong foundation here first and then take the next step when the time is right.

 What has been the most meaningful part of running your own restaurant so far?

 The most meaningful part has been watching everything come together—from construction to training our first team. Seeing customers enjoy the food for the first time and hearing their excitement has been incredible. It’s a reminder of why we started this journey—to bring people together through great food and genuine service.

 What do you hope your Woodland store brings to Sacramento residents?

 We want people to feel the energy and warmth the moment they walk in. Our goal is to bring a little taste of Nashville to Northern California while creating a fun, family-friendly space. We hope our store becomes a go-to spot for locals to relax, connect, and enjoy great food made with care.

 Any community partnerships or events planned that you are ready to share?

 We’ve already joined the Woodland Chamber of Commerce and plan to partner with local schools and sports teams. We’ll also host community events, including a Friends & Family Night and grand opening giveaways. Supporting our local community is a big part of who we are, so we’re excited to keep finding ways to get involved and give back.
