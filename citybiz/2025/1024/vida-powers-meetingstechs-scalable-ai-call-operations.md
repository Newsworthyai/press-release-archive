# Vida Powers MeetingsTech’s Scalable AI Call Operations

MeetingsTech, LLC (MT), a Saint Petersburg, Florida-based direct marketing firm specializing in insurance, health, and home services, has spent nearly a decade building its reputation on speed, accuracy, and compliance. With a salesforce that scales seasonally to handle high-volume client campaigns, MT’s model has long depended on intensive training and in-house oversight, an approach that ensured quality but came with rising operational costs.

 As the company looked to expand capacity without expanding headcount, it turned to automation. In late 2024, MT partnered with Vida, an AI voice agent platform built to replicate complex call workflows while maintaining strict compliance. The goal was to create a smarter, scalable backbone for MT’s call operations.

 Rapid AI Integration

 Implementation took weeks, not months. Vida’s AI agents were trained on MT’s existing scripts and quickly went live, managing outbound meeting confirmations and lead-qualification calls. This allowed MT’s human teams to focus on higher-value interactions and strategic account work while AI handled the repetitive but critical daily volume.

 Measurable Results in Under a Year

 Within eight months, Vida’s AI agents had become a permanent fixture of MT’s operation, handling a significant share of daily calls and ensuring uninterrupted coverage during Medicare open enrollment and other seasonal surges.

 Key results include:

 * 65–70% meeting confirmations, up from roughly 45%
* Cancellations reduced to 9%, down from 14%
* Instant scalability during peak call periods and after-hours demand
* Improved cost efficiency by increasing throughput without adding staff

 “Vida is helping us achieve higher confirmation rates, fewer cancellations, and scalable throughput,” said Heather Krapf, Vice President of Operations at Medicare Express. “It’s quickly becoming the backbone of our call strategy, with a clear path to scaling across all inbound and outbound volume while unlocking significant efficiency gains and margin growth.”

 Building an AI-Ready Future

 The partnership has also laid the groundwork for at least twenty new AI use cases across MT’s operations. Following success in Medicare meeting confirmations, MT is preparing to expand Vida’s reach into after-hours inbound handling and new vertical markets, where automation can further reduce cost and increase responsiveness.

 Balancing Automation and Human Insight

 Despite the shift toward AI, MT emphasizes that people remain central to its business. By offloading high-volume, repetitive tasks to Vida, the company’s staff can dedicate more time to strategic engagement and client growth initiatives.

 For MT, the message is clear: AI does not replace people, it enables them. With Vida embedded across its workflows, the company has created a model that blends human expertise with automation, setting a new benchmark for performance and scalability in compliance-driven industries.
