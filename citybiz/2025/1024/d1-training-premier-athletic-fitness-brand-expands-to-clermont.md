# D1 Training, Premier Athletic Fitness Brand Expands to Clermont

D1 Training, a leading fitness enrichment concept utilizing the five core tenets of athletic-based training, recently opened a new location in Clermont at 2631 S. HWY 27, Suite 101. The new group fitness facility employs a sports-science backed training regimen led by certified trainers to help people of all ages achieve their sport and fitness goals.

 London Dewey and Ron Zmuda have joined a roster of impressive existing franchisees, including professional athletes like Kylie Fitts and Jordan Gay. Additional D1 partners include NBA star Chris Paul and Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow.

 The husband-and-wife duo has deep roots in the metro Orlando area, both having been raised there. London, a former high school athlete and University of Florida graduate, spent years in chemical engineering but was inspired by her family’s entrepreneurial background to start her own business. Ron is also a UF graduate and a University of Central Florida graduate. He has spent his career as a small business attorney and has always shared her passion for fitness. As parents of two young children, they love that D1 Training allows them to be part of the experience while helping others achieve their fitness goals.

 “We’ve always wanted to build something that reflects our passion for fitness and D1 Training helps fill a hole that exists here, when it comes to fitness concepts for kids,” said London. “D1 is the perfect fit, not just for us, but for the community. We love that it brings together athletes of all ages, including our own kids, in a space designed for motivation, growth, and performance.”

 D1 Training offers four age-based programs including Rookie (ages 7-11), Developmental (ages 12-14), Prep (ages 15-18) and D1 Adult. Each fitness program is based on the five athletic-based tenets: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down. Outside of group workouts, D1 Training offers team, semi-private, and one-on-one training with world-class coaches. The goal is simple: to continue to train athletes who are dedicated to their sport or fitness goals, regardless of age, or athletic background.

 “London and Ron are the ideal candidates to bring the D1 Training experience to Clermont,” said the brand’s Chief Operating Officer, Dan Murphy. “We’re thrilled to welcome them to the D1 family and are confident in their ability to show the Clermont area what they’ve been missing out on. D1 is a one-of-a-kind fitness experience that’s built around the individual and meant to help people meet their athletic goals. Our strong network of franchisees embodies our core values to bring the D1 Training vision to life, and we know London and Ron will do just that in Clermont and its surrounding communities.”

 Strategically expanding across the nation through franchising, D1 Training has more than 135 performance centers open with over 150 additional locations in various stages of development. The brand is currently seeking financially qualified business builders, former athletes, and entrepreneurs, who share a passion for fitness and youth sports, who are ready to make a positive impact on their community.
