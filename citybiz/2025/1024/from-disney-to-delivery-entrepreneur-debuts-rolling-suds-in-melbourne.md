# From Disney to Delivery: Entrepreneur Debuts Rolling Suds in Melbourne

Rolling Suds, America’s leading power-washing franchise, will debut its newest location in Melbourne on October 27. Located at 2280 Avocado Ave, Unit 6, the new franchise provides tailored cleaning solutions designed to extend asset lifespan, reduce tenant turnover, and protect long-term property value.

 To mark the opening, Rolling Suds will host a ribbon-cutting ceremony on October 29 at 4:30 p.m. with the local Chamber of Commerce. Guests can enjoy yacht rock music, refreshments, and enter for a chance to win a pair of Rolling Suds bubble socks.

 The new location is owned by entrepreneur Devin Hollenbaugh, whose background blends leadership, business, and international experience:

 * Originally from Maryland, Hollenbaugh studied business administration and German before beginning his career with The Walt Disney Company.
* He later joined the U.S. Army Contracting Command, where he led a team of 13 while working in Germany.
* After returning from overseas, he launched Lightfoot Logistics LLC through Amazon’s DSP program, growing the operation to more than 100 drivers.
* In 2025, Hollenbaugh and his wife, a Florida native, returned home to raise their three sons and establish deeper roots in the community.

 When Devin came across Rolling Suds, he saw it as the perfect next step—an opportunity to apply his leadership experience to something local, hands-on, and meaningful that serves both homeowners and businesses in his community.

 “After years of moving around, it feels good to be back in Florida and building something that directly serves our neighbors,” said Hollenbaugh. “Rolling Suds gives me the chance to apply what I’ve learned over the years in a way that helps local families and businesses take pride in their properties.”

 Rolling Suds is a proven business backed by more than 30-years of industry experience and knowledge. One of its key differentiators is the quality and process of the service itself, and ability to complete jobs two to three times more quickly. Rolling Suds has a proprietary cleaning process which utilizes high-quality materials and a specific dilution of soaps within their wash method. With state-of-the-art equipment and highly trained professionals, Rolling Suds is a sustainable business with the ability to invest back into itself.

 The Rolling Suds brand and franchise is built on three core elements – relationships, reputation and reliability – and each are applicable to both consumers and franchisees. Having unparalleled experience in such an unregulated industry, Rolling Suds franchisees will be able to differentiate themselves from competitors through a recession-resistant business model. The business support that franchisees receive is immense, including a nine-week interactive power launch training program, one week in person training, six months of lead generation, digital and marketing needs handled, technician training, among many other essential business aspects are provided. It’s truly a complete business in a box.
