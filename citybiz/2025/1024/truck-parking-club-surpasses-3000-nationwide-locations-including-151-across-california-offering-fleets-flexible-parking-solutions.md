# Truck Parking Club Surpasses 3,000 Nationwide Locations, Including 151 Across California, Offering Fleets Flexible Parking Solutions

Truck Parking Club, the Chattanooga-based technology platform connecting truck drivers and fleets with available private parking spaces, has expanded to 151 active locations across California, part of a broader network of 3,000 sites nationwide.

 The company’s marketplace now offers more than 51,000 instantly reservable parking spaces across 49 states, a milestone achieved after adding 1,000 new sites in just four months. This rapid growth highlights rising demand for on-demand, flexible parking solutions in key logistics regions like California, where freight volume and real estate constraints make parking especially scarce.

 California’s major freight corridors and ports – from Los Angeles and Long Beach to Stockton and the Inland Empire – face persistent shortages of legal, safe truck parking. Truck Parking Club is helping fill that gap by transforming underused private properties into secure, reservable spaces for drivers and fleets.

 “California’s trucking infrastructure is vital to the U.S. economy, but safe, reliable parking remains one of the biggest barriers to efficiency,” said Evan Shelley, Co-Founder and CEO of Truck Parking Club. “By activating underused private properties, we’re helping fleets and drivers find flexible, affordable parking options while reducing congestion and liability.”

 A Smarter Way to Manage Fleet Operations

 Truck Parking Club enables drivers and fleets to reserve parking by the hour, day, week, or month through its website and mobile app. Fleets use the platform to strategically position trucks near pick-up and delivery points, improve compliance with Hours of Service (HOS) regulations, and avoid costly roadside parking.

 For property owners, the system provides a turnkey way to monetize unused land, such as storage yards, terminals, or industrial lots, with no upfront cost. Truck Parking Club’s technology manages reservations, payments, and customer service, allowing new hosts to activate listings within days.

 Addressing a National Infrastructure Challenge

 The U.S. trucking industry faces a 1.7-million-space shortfall, costing more than $100 billion annually in lost productivity and inefficiencies. Traditional parking construction can cost up to $200,000 per space, while Truck Parking Club’s marketplace model leverages existing infrastructure to deliver immediate capacity and improve safety for drivers nationwide.

 Truck Parking Club operates a nationwide network of instantly reservable truck parking spaces across the United States. Through its website and mobile apps, drivers and fleets can book hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly parking.
