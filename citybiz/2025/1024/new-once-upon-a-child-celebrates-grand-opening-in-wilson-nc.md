# New Once Upon A Child Celebrates Grand Opening in Wilson, NC

Once Upon A Child®, the leading children’s clothing and accessories retail resale concept, announced the grand opening of its location in Wilson located at 2101 Tarboro St. The brand is known for providing local parents with a place that not only puts cash back into their pockets, but sells gently used children’s clothing, shoes, toys, accessories and equipment for less.

 With a focus on being a sustainable shopping resource for local families, the new Once Upon A Child in Wilson opens on October 30. Once Upon A Child is part of Winmark – the Resale Company®, a unique national retail resale franchise that focuses on sustainability, small business formation and providing Resale for Everyone®.

 Meet the Local Owner

 As a longtime Once Upon A Child shopper, Rease Newton often made the 45-minute trip to the nearest store before realizing families in her hometown of Wilson deserved the same opportunity closer to home. A mom of three and former educator with a passion for serving others, she saw the franchise as the perfect way to give back to her community while making life easier for local parents. Together with her parents, Tom and Tonya Allen, who are also co-owners and proud supporters of the venture, Rease is excited to bring quality, affordable children’s items and a family-focused shopping experience to Wilson.

 “I remember seeing the franchise sticker on the window and thinking, ‘Our town deserves this,’” said Newton. “Wilson is such a hardworking, family-oriented community, and I’m excited to give local parents a place where they can save money, shop sustainably, and connect with others.”

 More about Once Upon A Child Wilson

 Once Upon A Child’s unique retail resale concept allows for clothing, toys and accessories for kids to end up in someone else’s house rather than thrown into a landfill, providing a resource for new or existing parents who are looking to update their children’s closet on a budget and in a mindful environmental manner.

 Unlike a typical consignment store, Once Upon A Child does not require appointments and pays on the spot for items it purchases from consumers. At Once Upon A Child families are able to buy necessities for their children at great values, and turn their gently used items into cash.

 In addition, Once Upon A Child ensures that all products purchased and sold meet mandatory and voluntary safety standards. Staff members stay up-to-date on current recalled items, immediately pulling all recalled products from shelves and making sure all items purchased are safety-checked to meet current standards.

 For questions on the buying process or store hours, the new Once Upon A Child can be reached at (252)-265-3010 or https://onceuponachild.com/locations/wilson-nc/ .
