# D1 Training, Premier Athletic Fitness Brand Expands into Forsyth County

D1 Training, a leading fitness enrichment concept utilizing the five core tenets of athletic-based training, recently opened a new location in Forsyth County at 2569 Peachtree Pkwy. The new group fitness facility employs a sports-science backed training regimen led by certified trainers to help people of all ages achieve their sport and fitness goals.

 Adam and Mindy Pure have joined a roster of impressive existing franchisees, including professional athletes like Kylie Fitts and Jordan Gay. Additional D1 partners include NBA star Chris Paul and Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow.

 Adam and Mindy Pure, the owners of D1 Training South Forsyth, are parents of four active, sports-loving children. Opening D1 Training was not just a business decision for the Pures—it was a lifestyle choice rooted in family, community, and a shared commitment to helping young athletes grow stronger and more confident both on and off the field.

 Adam was born and raised in Pennsylvania, during a time when most free time was spent outdoors playing sports like kickball, baseball, wrestling, skateboarding, and roller hockey. These early athletic experiences instilled core values such as teamwork, discipline, and belonging, which stayed with him through his college years at the University of Pittsburgh and into his professional career. Adam later moved to Georgia, where he spent more than 20 years operating a 24/7 answering service alongside his father.

 Through years of managing all aspects of the business—from IT to operations—Adam developed a strong belief in team culture and the importance of building a purpose-driven organization. This philosophy closely aligns with D1 Training’s core values, making the franchise a natural next chapter.

 Mindy was born in Rochester, NY, raised in Florida, and moved to Georgia in 2007. Her early career in retail helped her build a foundation of leadership rooted in empathy and efficiency. After starting a family, her focus shifted toward education and community involvement. She has served as a preschool teacher, school volunteer, PTA and PTO organizer, and a dependable resource within the local community.

 Currently working as an administrator at the family’s local temple, Mindy brings energy, compassion, and a commitment to youth development to every endeavor. Her passion for supporting children through fitness and mentorship made D1 Training a meaningful fit for the family.

 “We’ve seen firsthand how sports and structured training build confidence, character, and resilience,” says Adam. “Our goal is to create a space where families grow stronger together—where kids, teens, and adults are challenged, supported, and inspired every step of the way.”

 D1 Training offers four age-based programs including Rookie (ages 7-11), Developmental (ages 12-14), Prep (ages 15-18) and D1 Adult. Each fitness program is based on the five athletic-based tenets: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down. Outside of group workouts, D1 Training offers group, semi-private, and one-on-one training with world-class coaches. The goal is simple: to continue to train athletes who are dedicated to their sport or fitness goals, regardless of age, or athletic background.

 “Adam and Mindy are the ideal candidates to bring the D1 Training experience to the Cumming and Suwanee area,” said the brand’s Chief Operating Officer, Dan Murphy. “We’re thrilled to welcome them to the D1 family and are confident in their ability to show the Forsyth area what they’ve been missing out on. D1 is a one-of-a-kind fitness experience that’s built around the individual and meant to help people meet their athletic goals. Our strong network of franchisees embodies our core values to bring the D1 Training vision to life, and we know the Pure’s will do just that in Forsyth and its surrounding communities.”

 Strategically expanding across the nation through franchising, D1 Training has more than 100 performance centers open with over 100 additional locations in various stages of development. The brand is currently seeking financially qualified business builders, former athletes, and entrepreneurs, who share a passion for fitness and youth sports, who are ready to make a positive impact on their community.
