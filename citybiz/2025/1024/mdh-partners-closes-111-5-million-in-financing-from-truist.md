# MDH Partners Closes $111.5 Million in Financing from Truist

MDH Partners today announces the closing of $111.5 million in financing from Truist. The Canyon Loan supports nearly 800,000 square feet of MDH’s recent acquisitions across Georgia, Nevada and California. Director, Debt Capital Markets at MDH, Matthew Ludwig, joined the firm in June 2025 and secured the financing. Mark Hancock of Truist originated the loan for the firm.

 “Acknowledging the volatility within the capital markets, our disciplined underwriting, coupled with the high-performance of these assets, allowed us to secure competitive financing from our long-standing partner, Truist Bank,” said Ludwig. “The Canyon Loan strengthens the buying power of Fund III as we continue pursuing high-quality assets in top-tier industrial markets, including multiple new acquisitions in Texas and California, which we are excited to bring to market for financing in the coming weeks. We are well-positioned to continue deploying strategic capital and remain bullish on our target markets.”

 The Canyon Loan is a five-year, non-recourse loan supporting MDH’s acquisitions of 3970 Johns Creek in Suwanee, Georgia; Sunrise Buildings One and Two in Las Vegas; and Ontario Commerce Park in Ontario, California. The firm purchased 3970 Johns Creek, a 130,783-square-foot industrial property, in June 2025. Sunrise Buildings One and Two, totaling 509,216 square feet and located at 4601 E Cheyenne Ave, and 3101 N Marion Drive, were acquired in February 2025. The acquisition of Ontario Commerce Park, a fully leased, four-building 133,400-square-foot industrial park located at 720 – 780 S. Miliken Ave, closed in September 2025.

 “The Canyon Portfolio marks Truist’s fifth portfolio closing with MDH over the past five years and we greatly appreciate the full relationship we have formed with industry-leading MDH Partners,” said Truist’s Hancock. “The geographic and tenant diversification within the Canyon Portfolio, along with MDH’s proven management, allows this loan to cleanly fit within our Client and CRE strategy.”

 MDH is currently investing its Fund III, a $1.2 billion discretionary fund, and has closed more than $1.3 billion in assets since the beginning of 2024. The firm has another $175 million of properties under control or recently closed that have yet to be financed. The firm continues to actively pursue industrial investment opportunities across all risk profiles. MDH currently owns or manages approximately 35 million square feet across 33 markets in 18 states.
