# Q&amp;A with Dr. Callum Potts, Reproductive Endocrinologist at CCRM Miami

Dr. Callum Potts is the founder and Medical Director of CCRM Fertility of Miami. He is fellowship trained in Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility and board-certified in Obstetrics and Gynecology. His specialties include infertility, egg freezing, IVF, fertility preservation (including oncofertility), PCOS, and male and tubal factor infertility.

 He has held leadership positions within the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, earned awards for teaching and clinical excellence, and published research presented at state and national conferences on topics such as fibroid management, ovarian hormone synthesis, endometrial receptivity, and menopause and cognition.

 What sets Dr. Potts apart is his personal experience with infertility. At home, he is the proud father of twin boys—a joyful outcome of his own treatment journey at CCRM. This experience drives his commitment to compassionate, personalized care, empowering patients to make informed, evidence-based decisions. He believes everyone should have the opportunity to build a family when ready and is a strong advocate for fertility preservation.

 What sets CCRM apart in the field of fertility care, especially here in South Florida?

 CCRM is known nationwide for delivering exceptional fertility outcomes through science-driven, personalized care. What makes our Aventura clinic unique is that everything is done on-site; our state-of-the-art lab, surgery center, and monitoring facilities are all under one roof. That means more continuity of care, less stress for our patients, and faster, more reliable results. There’s no outsourcing to third-party labs or agencies; our in-house team handles every step of the process with precision and care.

 Can you walk us through the types of services CCRM offers?

 Absolutely. We offer a full spectrum of fertility care, from basic diagnostics to highly advanced treatments. That includes fertility testing for both men and women, IVF, IUI, egg and sperm freezing, donor and gestational carrier services, and genetic testing. We also provide preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) to help select the healthiest embryos, which is especially helpful for patients with recurrent loss or known genetic conditions. In addition to clinical services, we support patients with fertility preservation, family planning consultations, and second opinions.

 What resources are available to help support patients during what can be a very emotional journey?

 We know that fertility care can be overwhelming, which is why we offer a wide range of resources to help guide and support our patients. On our website, you’ll find webinars, financial planning tools, FAQs, medication guides, and downloadable checklists that help demystify the process. We also work closely with fertility financing partners and offer transparent pricing to make care more accessible. Patients have access to online scheduling, secure portals, and a responsive team that guides them every step of the way.

 Your own family has gone through IVF, how has that experience shaped the way you work with your patients?

 It’s had a huge impact on the way I practice medicine. My wife and I went through the IVF process to have our twin boys, so I understand firsthand the emotional highs and lows that come with the journey. It’s not just clinical, it’s deeply personal. That experience gives me a unique perspective, and I try to create a space where patients feel seen, supported, and confident in their path forward.

 What should people in South Florida know about CCRM’s Aventura clinic?

 First and foremost, we’re here and ready to help. Whether someone is just starting to think about their fertility, needs a second opinion, or has been trying without success, we meet them where they are. Our team is highly specialized, and we take a collaborative, compassionate approach to every case. Our goal at CCRM Aventura is to bring world-class fertility care to South Florida, and we’re proud to help make parenthood possible for more families in our community.
