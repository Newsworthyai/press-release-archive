# Couple Finds the Retirement Lifestyle They Were Looking for at Emerson Lakes

By Linda Esterson

 One night after dinner, Nancy and Gene Breen started discussing their senior living options.

 Living in a single-family house in Lakewood Ranch, Fla., they wondered if it would be best to hire in-home care, if or when they need it. They also considered moving to a retirement community, where health care would be offered on site.

 The next day, they received a mailing highlighting the amenities at Emerson Lakes, an Erickson Senior Living community under construction in Lakewood Ranch. Seeing that as more than a coincidence, they scheduled a visit to the Sales and Information Center.

 “While we stopped in just to learn about the community, we looked at each other and said, ‘This is our answer!'” Nancy recalls.

 Checking the boxes

 The couple met with Sales Counselor Mike Fletcher, who provided helpful information on the community’s maintenance-free residences, amenities, health care, pricing, and more.

 The Breens especially appreciate that, as a continuing care retirement community, Emerson Lakes will offer independent living residences as well as care options to meet a range of needs. Plus, the on-site medical center will be open when the first residents move in next fall.

 “As we get older, it’s nice to know that we will have care that is right there,” Nancy notes.

 They also value the financial benefits of moving to an Erickson Senior Living community. The monthly service package, for instance, bundles the costs of most living expenses into one predictable bill.

 “I did an analysis of our current living costs–property taxes, utilities, and food–and it’s almost an even sum game when you put it all together,” Nancy explains. “We found that to be very attractive.”

 Nancy and Gene further vetted the community by getting an expert opinion from their financial advisor.

 “Everything came back very positive,” Nancy says. “We liked everything we heard!”

 Planning ahead

 After conducting their due diligence, the Breens joined Emerson Lakes’ Priority List, which saved their spot in line for a two-bedroom, two-bath floor plan with a screened lanai.

 Once it became available, the Breens reserved the home, enabling them to lock in the entrance fee,* collected as part of the residency process, at that year’s rate.

 “Even though they won’t make the move until next year, they will be paying the 2024 price,” explains Fletcher. “That’s just one benefit of reserving a residence sooner than later.”

 Fletcher also points to the community’s professional planning and moving services, which are only offered to Priority List members.

 Easy living

 Emerson Lakes checked all of the Breens’ boxes, and they now have the freedom to envision their future carefree lifestyle.

 “We’re looking forward to not having to meal plan or cook and also relinquishing house responsibilities,” Gene says.

 With several restaurants on campus, all staffed with experienced executive chefs, residents will have a variety of fresh, cooked-to-order dishes to choose from for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Grocery shopping, cooking, and washing dishes will be tasks of the past!

 Emerson Lakes’ grounds crew takes care of the landscaping, and General Services handles all maintenance requests–even simple chores like replacing the water filter in the refrigerator–in a timely manner.

 “It takes away a lot of anxiety, knowing that someone will always be there to help us,” Nancy adds.

 Their daughter, son-in-law, and three grandchildren live close by, and they, too, were pleased to hear about the community’s range of services.

 “When we told them about Emerson Lakes, there were hugs and a great sense of relief,” Nancy explains. “They really want to help, but it puts a mixed burden on them. They are happy to know that their visits will be for pleasure and not about helping us around the house.”

 Making friends

 With added freedom in retirement, the Breens are eager to spend time in the community’s state-of-the-art fitness center and 25-meter outdoor pool.

 And while Nancy and Gene will maintain their current friendships, they’re also looking forward to building a new social network at Emerson Lakes. In fact, they have already had the pleasure of connecting with others who plan to move to the community by attending fun, informational Priority List events.

 “We’ve met some really nice people,” Gene says. “We’ve already set up an email group so we can get to know each other!”
