# Kasirer, NYC’s Leading Lobbying Firm, Expands Services and Elevates Senior Leadership

Kasirer today announced promotions within its senior leadership team to support the company’s continued growth. Suri Kasirer, founder and one of the most powerful and influential voices in NYC policy, has become chief executive officer where she will serve as a trusted thought leader and connector, supporting clients at the intersection of the public, private and nonprofit sectors. Under her leadership, Suri will have a large role helping clients navigate New York while contributing to a thriving city and state. Julie Greenberg has been promoted to president where she will oversee Kasirer’s client portfolio, leading government relations strategy for its real estate, corporate, and nonprofit portfolios.

 “What started as a one-woman operation, Kasirer has grown to become an essential partner in New York’s success story, helping shape the skyline of the five boroughs, driving innovation by connecting corporate leaders with government, and ensuring that nonprofits have the resources to continue serving our city, “ said Suri Kasirer. “I could not be more proud to continue working alongside Julie and the rest of this expert team to advance the enduring story of this city.”

 Recognizing that many of the firm’s partners require more than direct government advocacy, Kasirer today announced the launch of Kasirer Strategic Advisors (KSA), a new division dedicated to providing strategic advisory services beyond traditional lobbying for any company, organization or person that hopes to succeed in the New York market. As part of this expansion, Mike Braun, Chief Strategy Officer, will become the Managing Director of KSA, where he will lead a best-in-class group of advisors to provide critical counsel to help any company, organization or person navigate New York’s complex and ever-evolving ecosystem.

 What makes KSA uniquely powerful is that it’s built on the foundation of Suri Kasirer’s two decades of impact shaping all of New York City—from landmark developments to groundbreaking policy initiatives. This unparalleled track record makes the firm a key partner to anyone across the world who wants to succeed in New York. Under Suri’s continued leadership, and with her deep relationships across every sector, KSA offers access to the networks, insights, and influence that have been instrumental in transforming this city.

 “This new venture reflects our deep understanding that success in New York requires more than just governmental outcomes; it demands strategic navigation of the intricate relationships and dynamics that drive this market,” said Kasirer.
