# Vouched Raises $17M Series A led by Spring Rock Ventures

Vouched, the leader in AI-powered identity and agent verification, today announced the closing of its Series A funding round, raising $17 million, led by Spring Rock Ventures. This milestone marks a key phase of growth and innovation for Vouched as it continues setting trust standards for autonomous agents and humans.

 The new capital closely trails the successful launch of KnowThat.ai, an Agent Reputation Directory, as part of its “Know Your Agent” (KYA) suite, which has rapidly gained traction across enterprises in e-commerce, digital marketplaces, and regulated industries. The KYA solution offers a comprehensive lifecycle approach to both AI agent and human identity onboarding and verification, as well as contextual, continuous monitoring of agent behavior, with modules for credentials, risk, and continuous compliance, powered by AI and advanced analytics. KYA allows organizations to easily onboard agents with verified and persistent identities and profiles, conduct real-time monitoring of agent activities, and proactively detect anomalous or potentially malicious agent behavior.

 The KYA suite sets a new benchmark for agent verification, delivering transparent, secure, and compliant identity standards for next-generation AI agents. It supports open frameworks, such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP), to advance interoperability and trust in agent ecosystems. In addition, these tools provide developer-friendly APIs and a turnkey MCP-Identity server, enabling rapid implementation of agent identity management in both new and legacy enterprise environments.

 “We are doubling down on KYA’s vision of trustworthy autonomous agents and scaling our platform to match the pace of a rapidly evolving digital world with this Series A,” said Peter Horadan, Vouched CEO. “We are grateful for our investors’ confidence and are excited to realize the next phase of growth for Vouched, our partners, and the communities we serve.”

 Since the introduction of KYA and KnowThat.ai, Vouched has focused on enabling organizations to tackle the increasing need for secure identity and agent verification as autonomous agents become more prevalent in digital business.

 The platform’s design aligns with emerging industry standards and regulatory expectations, positioning Vouched to support enterprises as they navigate the evolving landscape of digital trust. With this new funding, the company plans to advance product development, expand collaboration with industry partners, and drive ongoing innovation for customers, preparing for the future of agent-driven interactions.
