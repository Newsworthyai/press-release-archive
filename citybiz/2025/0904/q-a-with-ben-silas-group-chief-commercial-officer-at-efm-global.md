 How has EFM’s commercial strategy evolved to meet the growing complexity of global supply chains

 EFM has moved to a global account model, where offices across time zones work together to provide consistent service wherever clients operate. For example, a UK client expanding into Saudi Arabia faced repeated shipment issues with their previous provider. Our UK and KSA teams collaborated to manage shipments and even held stock locally until the client secured their own warehouse. The result: seamless service and a client confident in our global capabilities.

 We track these accounts closely, setting annual revenue targets and monitoring progress, but the real measure of success is client feedback and referrals. One global fitness event operator, recommended us from APAC to their US counterpart after seeing consistent service across regions. In an unpredictable world, this global model provides both flexibility and reassurance that EFM can deliver anywhere.

 You often work with clients on critical one-time events rather than long-term contracts. What are the commercial and operational demands of delivering in that kind of pressure-filled environment?

 Trust is everything. When a client hands us a high-profile event, they’re relying on us to protect their reputation. That’s why clients return.

 We quote transparently, anticipating potential costs based on experience, unlike competitors who add surprises later. On the film Tenet, we created a master project plan giving the studio complete visibility and control over logistics.

 Planning for contingencies is key: backup sailings, alternative air routes and proactive risk management are built into every project. Clients know that if something goes wrong, EFM is prepared to step in.

 Can you share an example of a recent client engagement that highlights EFM’s unique value or flexibility?

 A promoter in Australia was told a carnet extension was impossible, which would have delayed their tour. Our team confirmed the details locally and secured the extension, keeping the schedule intact. That decision unlocked the entire tour, from Australia to Singapore and the UK, and turned the client into a long-term partner.

 What sets EFM apart isn’t new processes, it’s experience and speed. We assess every option, validate locally and only give a “yes” when we’re 100% confident. Clients rely on this flexibility to keep their events on track when others can’t.

 EFM plays a key role in global live entertainment logistics. What’s unique about services in this space versus more traditional logistics sectors?

 In live entertainment, delays aren’t just inconvenient; they can cancel shows, cost revenue and damage reputations. Our clients rely on us to think ahead, plan A, B, C and D, and keep the show going.

 Recently, customs delays threatened a shipment to Mexico. Our team quickly secured alternative sailings and airfreight, re-routing containers and coordinating across multiple ports to meet deadlines. This real-time agility, trained through historical scenarios, is what differentiates EFM: when stakes are high, failure isn’t an option.

 How does your team position EFM as more than just a logistics provider, as a strategic partner?

 We act as consultants, guiding clients through complex logistics challenges. For the Fashion Freak Show, we resolved lost carnets by orchestrating alternative routing, ensuring the production went ahead on schedule.

 Trust is built from the first meeting. We bring project managers into client discussions, share real-world examples, and handle the first shipment flawlessly. From there, relationships deepen, and clients see EFM as a partner who provides foresight and solutions, not just transport.

 What trends are you seeing in the sport and entertainment sectors that you think are under-appreciated or overlooked?

 ESG is becoming an increasingly important factor. Clients want suppliers who share their values, so we’ve partnered on carbon offset programs and greener transport options.

 Logistics decisions are rarely top-down; project managers often choose suppliers based on relationships. That’s why our people are our greatest asset.

 Sponsorship growth is raising the stakes for events and geopolitical disruptions, like the Red Sea rerouting, which show why foresight and contingency planning are critical. Clients who understand these trends stay ahead; those who don’t risk delays or cancellations.

 Are there shifts that clients aren’t yet preparing for, but should be?

 Digitalisation is coming fast. The new digital carnet system, launching in April 2026, will impact 90% of our work. Countries will come online in phases, and clear guidance will be essential. EFM has already run pilot shipments to gain practical experience and prepare clients.

 Potential continued tariff changes, especially in the US, could also disrupt planning and budgeting. We monitor these developments closely to help clients adapt before they impact their projects.

 What sets EFM Global apart when it comes to supporting global events, supply chains, and organizations with critical logistics needs?

 Our people. The EFM Pathway develops talent from junior to senior roles, blending multimodal knowledge with on-site experience and solutions-focused thinking.

 Jason Bird, for example, joined as a junior and is now VP of Music after 20 years. This depth of expertise translates into client trust, revenue growth and minimal churn. Promoting from within and prioritising cultural fit ensures we have leaders who can make smart decisions under pressure and clients see the difference immediately.

 What’s next for EFM Global as you look toward the next 12 to 18 months?

 We’re focused on growth, particularly in the US, expanding beyond music into new verticals. Technology will support this: enhanced rate management tools and new sales platforms will streamline operations and uncover opportunities.

 The goal is simple: combine our people-led expertise with the right technology to deliver high standards at scale, keeping clients confident that EFM can handle anything the world throws at them.
