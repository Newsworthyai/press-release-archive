# Devonshire’s Fitness Specialists Offer a Personalized Approach to Well-Being

By Kelly Shue

 With on-site amenities like a state-of-the-art fitness center and outdoor swimming pool, community members at Devonshire, the Erickson Senior Living community at PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., find it easy to maintain an active lifestyle.

 “We enjoy opportunities for physical fitness–and socialization and laughter,” says community member Toni Goodman. “It really keeps us going.”

 Fitness experts

 And since Fitness Specialist Deborah Mazda joined the team last summer, Devonshire’s fitness offerings have only continued to grow.

 Mazda, who holds a master’s degree in physiology and sports psychology and boasts 40 years of experience in the fitness field, partners with fellow specialist Remy Harwood to help community members meet their goals–through one-on-one training and by leading group classes.

 “I’m dedicated to helping seniors get strong,” says Mazda. “As we age, we lose muscle mass, so my goal is to keep everyone as strong as possible. Healthy seniors are happy seniors!”

 Getting started

 At the heart of Devonshire’s wellness offerings is the impressive fitness center, equipped with top-notch strength and cardio machines as well as free weights, balls, and bands.

 For those new to the fitness center, Mazda and Harwood provide orientations on what each machine targets and how to use them. They also recommend an introductory exercise plan, based on their abilities and goals.

 “I see orientations as an opportunity to get to know each other,” says Mazda. “Remy and I typically advise a slow start. We want community members to come in and begin a routine that will set them up for success. Well-being is not a one-size-fits-all program! Instead, we recommend activities and classes that meet people where they are in their fitness journey.”

 This personalized approach helps community members stay engaged and motivated.

 “Deborah and Remy are always available and eager to help. If you are using a piece of equipment incorrectly, they will help you do it properly,” says Toni. “The Devonshire fitness staff has given me the tools and moral support to make much of this possible.”

 Popular Pilates

 One of the most popular ways community members stay active is through group classes, all led by expertly trained fitness instructors like Mazda and Harwood.

 Tailored to seniors’ abilities, the classes range from fast-paced cardiovascular and strength training to yoga and stretching. Pilates Circles, Devonshire’s newest group fitness class, combines several exercise techniques.

 Mazda, who launched the class, says, “Through the years, I’ve developed ways to tailor classes to best meet the needs of seniors. With Pilates Circles, I wanted to focus on using the Pilates ring while seated in a chair. There are three components to the class–yoga, Pilates, and balance work. I’m happy to see how popular the class has become.”

 Toni makes sure never to miss the twice-a-week class.

 “When I finish, I feel ten feet tall–loose and limber, ready to start the day. It’s amazing,” says Toni. “The class allows me to really stretch my muscles, especially my back and quads.”

 Toni also participates in Harwood’s total body workout class and Mazda’s cardio and strength class.

 “Each class addresses different areas of the body, which is great,” she says.

 Devonshire also offers two aquatics classes as well as Zumba. Plus, Mazda and Harwood are currently working on creating a Rock Steady Boxing class, ideal for those with Parkinson’s. The evidence-based exercise curriculum is specifically designed to impact the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.

 Hard work pays off

 Thanks to the personalized instruction and variety of fun opportunities available, Devonshire community members continue to enjoy an active lifestyle–with far-reaching results.

 Toni, who moved to the community with some rather serious injuries, points to her fitness routine as the reason why she’s able to make the most of her retirement.

 “With the help of the classes, I recently attended a dinner party wearing a stacked heeled shoe. I was not only able to stand throughout the cocktail hour, but for the first time in a long time, I was able to dance!” she recalls. “The next morning, I figured I would pay for my behavior, but I bounced right out of bed, ready to go.”

 “So many people who used to dislike exercising change their minds after visiting the fitness center or participating in the classes offered here,” notes Mazda. “Not only do they begin to feel better and gain more energy, but they are healthier and happier!”
