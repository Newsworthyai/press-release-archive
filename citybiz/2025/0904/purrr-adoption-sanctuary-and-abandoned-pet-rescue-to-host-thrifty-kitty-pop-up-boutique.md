# PURRR Adoption + Sanctuary and Abandoned Pet Rescue to Host Thrifty Kitty Pop-Up Boutique

Joining Forces for Second Chances. Shop Fashion. Save Lives.

 What/Who:

 Two organizations, one mission: second chances. In celebration of National Happy Cat Month, celebrated in September, PURRR Adoption + Sanctuary and Abandoned Pet Rescue are collaborating to host Thrifty Kitty Pop-Up Boutique on Tuesday, Sept. 30. The evening will begin with a sneak peek from 4 to 5 p.m. and general admission will open from 5 to 8 p.m.

 The community is invited to an evening of shopping, style and second chances to benefit PURRR Adoption + Sanctuary and Abandoned Pet Rescue. Supporters can Buy-A-Bag, Fill-A-Bag with a selection of men’s and women’s fashion to help give cats and dogs a second chance at life. Admission is free. Full bags are $50, and half bags are $25. Luxury brands and wedding dresses are not included in the Buy-A-Bag, Fill-A-Bag, and will be available for purchase at thrift pricing.

 Shoppers will also have the opportunity to meet adoptable cats and dogs looking for their furrr-ever homes and a second chance at love. Future pet parents can fill out adoption applications at the event.  “Partnering with Abandoned Pet Rescue for this event means twice the impact for animals in need,” said Executive Director of PURRR Adoption + Sanctuary Michelle Schecht. “Every bag purchased at Thrifty Kitty Pop-Up Boutique helps give cats and dogs a second chance at life, while also connecting future pet parents with their forever companions.”

 Proceeds from the event will be equally split between PURRR Adoption + Sanctuary and Abandoned Pet Rescue, ensuring both organizations can continue their lifesaving work.
