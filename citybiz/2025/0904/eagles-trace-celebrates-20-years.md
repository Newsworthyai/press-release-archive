# Eagle’s Trace Celebrates 20 Years!

By Susan Ingram

 Eagle’s Trace, an Erickson Senior Living community in West Houston, Tex., is excited to celebrate 20 years!

 A communitywide birthday party, featuring cake and champagne, kicked off the anniversary events earlier this year. The fun continued throughout the spring and summer with a square dance club demonstration, ice cream and barbershop quartet event, happy hour with a signature cocktail, and Eagle’s Trace-themed Jeopardy.

 In September, a commemorative aerial photo will be snapped via drone, followed by an outdoor movie accompanied by festive food trucks. The year’s celebration culminates in October with a Pioneer Residents and Staff Brunch, Lanterns of Remembrance, and a ceremony including fireworks, outdoor games, and activities for residents, staff members, family, and friends.

 “The anniversary celebrations have not only been fun but a good opportunity to pause and reflect on the community’s growth and success,” says Executive Director Steve Aigner.

 Pioneering the way

 Eagle’s Trace welcomed its first residents, known as “pioneers,” when the community opened in October 2005. Now, the 72-acre campus is home to more than 1,200 residents, served by 600-plus staff members.

 Among these pioneers were John Bowser and his late wife Nancy, who moved into a large one-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath home with a den in Piney Woods–the community’s first residence building.

 When the couple began exploring their senior living options, Eagle’s Trace was still under construction, but they wanted to take a look at the site and all the progress made so far. So, they made the 13-mile drive from their house in Sugar Land, Tex.

 “At the time, they only had temporary buildings here,” recalls John. “A car parked next to us, and it turned out they were neighbors from the opposite end of our street!”

 Impressed by the concept of the community, John and Nancy reserved a residence and moved in just a month after Eagle’s Trace opened. “Our neighbors moved in shortly after we did,” John adds.

 Now, he’s been enjoying the community’s vibrant, worry-free lifestyle for 20 years, and he couldn’t be happier.

 Exciting growth

 While Resident Life Director Kristen Kennedy isn’t a pioneer staff member, she still boasts an impressive tenure.

 “In my ten years of working at Eagle’s Trace, I have seen tremendous growth–from one neighborhood to three, and from four residence buildings to nine,” says Kennedy.

 Aigner, who has been with Eagle’s Trace for 11 years, watched the community’s population more than double and saw many new amenities come to fruition.

 “We have so much to celebrate! We are continually making investments, ensuring our community is up to date for current and incoming residents,” Aigner says. “Over the years, we’ve renovated our clubhouse and updated common areas with stylish new furniture and finishes.”

 He continues, “The growth of the community has brought so many features that residents really enjoy– new restaurants, al fresco dining, and amenities like the dog park, pickleball court, and bocce court. Residents also appreciate our on-site pharmacy, spaces for educational endeavors, and a large life enrichment center. Our little town of Eagle’s Trace has so much to offer.”

 Scrapbook memories

 All of those exciting changes are captured in the community’s “history scrapbook,” which John and a group of 17 other residents started compiling back in 2015 in preparation for the 10th anniversary.

 The scrapbook, which has grown three or four inches in thickness, according to John, resides in the Eagle’s Trace library for residents to access. A second copy is in John’s possession.

 “We collected just a whole lot of stuff,” notes John, including resident profiles, a timeline of construction, and a list of original residents. “I was going through it recently and found a list of ‘The Eagle’s Trace Pioneers.’ We were the people who moved in, in October, November, and December of 2005.”

 ‘A wonderful culture’

 Thinking back on those beginnings, John identifies two significant aspects of his years at Eagle’s Trace.

 “The first is the continued growth of the community,” John says. “We now have 11 buildings in total, including our clubhouse and the continuing care neighborhood.”

 Second is the residents. “When people move in, they can become your friends,” says John. “I’ve heard people say, ‘I have more good, close friends here than any time in my life,’ and I agree.”

 Aigner adds, “As a result of our growth, many new residents and staff members have joined our family, and a wonderful culture has blossomed. I’m proud that more people call Eagle’s Trace home and that we’ve created a real sense of belonging here.”
