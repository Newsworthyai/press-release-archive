# Q&amp;A with Jason Wong and Wati Longchar, Owners of Studio Pilates International Williamsburg

Jason Wong and his wife, Wati Longchar, opened Studio Pilates International Williamsburg in September 2024 as a passion project rooted in personal experience. Wati first discovered Studio Pilates International in 2021 as a client at the South Slope location, where she fell in love with the format and the strength, balance, and energy it brought into her life. Inspired by her transformation and drawing on his background in hospitality and wellness-focused nutrition programs, Jason saw an opportunity to bring this life-changing concept to their own neighborhood.

 Combining Wati’s expertise in corporate consulting with Jason’s experience in restaurants, catering, and community-building, the pair built Studio Pilates Williamsburg into a hub for health, connection, and belonging. In its first nine months, the studio welcomed more than 1,250 new clients, launched three Amplify Challenges with over 150 participants, and partnered with local brands including Talea Beer Co., Jones Road Beauty, ON, and Skincare by Sol – quickly becoming one of the highest-performing Studio Pilates locations worldwide.

 Known for its supportive, inclusive environment, the studio meets clients at every fitness level with energy and encouragement. Looking ahead, Jason and Wati are preparing to expand with a second location in Long Island City, continuing their mission to create spaces that motivate, care for, and empower people both inside and outside the studio.

 Can you each share a bit about your backgrounds before opening Studio Pilates International Williamsburg?

 Jason: My background is in marketing and operations management. I founded and operated several successful vegetarian restaurants in NYC, which gave me a deep understanding of customer experience, team leadership, and community building. Later, I transitioned into large scale school meals and wellness-based catering, where I focused on creating scratch-made, nourishing meals rather than relying on processed options. That same commitment to quality, service, and purpose is what I’ve carried into Studio Pilates.

 Wati: My background is management consulting, serving banking and capital markets clients with a focus on internal audit services. I have extensive experience helping large organizations strengthen their processes and manage risk. I discovered Studio Pilates during the pandemic, and it quickly became a key part of my well-being. Inspired by the positive changes it brought to my life, I wanted to open a Studio Pilates studio to help others experience those same benefits and to build a supportive wellness community.

 Wati, what initially drew you to Studio Pilates International as a client – and what made you fall in love with it?

 Wati: I started taking classes at the South Slope location in early 2021 and was immediately drawn in by the structure of the workouts, the safety and support of the reformer design, and the visible results I saw in myself. I loved that each class was just 45 minutes – easy to fit into a busy schedule- and that every workout was enjoyable and never repetitive. I felt stronger, more energized, and more balanced – not just physically, but mentally too. But what truly made me fall in love with Studio Pilates International was the community – the welcoming people, the inspiring instructors, and the positive energy in the room. The whole experience was uplifting, and I knew I wanted to share that feeling with others.

 Jason, coming from hospitality and wellness, what clicked for you when you saw Wati’s transformation?

 Jason: Seeing Wati get stronger and more energized – especially during such a stressful time – was powerful. I know firsthand how the right environment can change someone’s health and mindset. That’s when I realized Pilates could be more than a workout – it could be a community service with a real impact.

 What’s it like running a business as a married couple – how do you divide responsibilities? What about as parents?

 Jason: We’ve learned to divide and conquer. Wati is the CEO and CFO – she oversees finances, systems, and strategic direction.

 Wati: Jason is the COO and CMO – he runs operations, manages the team, and handles community partnerships. As parents, we’ve moved from the busy season of raising young children to now supporting two incredible young women – one in college and one college-bound. We’ve always aimed to raise independent thinkers with strong character, and we put our trust in the decisions they make as they step into adulthood. At the same time, we’ve made sure they know we’re always here for them. The lessons we’ve learned through parenting – patience, communication, and a growth mindset – are the same principles we bring into our leadership at the studio.

 What were some of the biggest challenges in opening the studio – from buildout to launch?

 Jason: We built our studio from the ground up – handling everything from construction and equipment installation to hiring our first team members. Navigating delays, managing costs, and staying on schedule were major challenges, but our shared vision kept us aligned. Throughout it all, our community was incredibly supportive. We’ve learned that hiring the right people is key to building the culture we envision for our studios. The number one challenge for us is always finding the right team member with the right mindset. We want our team to be champions – of each other and of our community. Our core value is being a team player, which means showing up with support, empathy, and zero judgment. We also recognize that everyone’s journey is different – whether someone’s with us for a year or on their way to pursue something new, we want to be part of that growth. We’re not only here for our clients – we’re here for our team, and we’re proud to champion their aspirations as much as our own.

 Studio Pilates Williamsburg is now one of the highest-performing locations globally – what do you think sets it apart?

 Jason: We lead with heart. For us, it’s never just about selling Pilates – it’s about building genuine relationships and creating a welcoming, supportive community. Every touchpoint is intentional: from our instructor mentorship programs and front desk training, to our community partnerships and challenge events. We’re deeply involved in daily operations, and we treat every client as an individual, meeting them where they are on their wellness journey. Our focus has always been on providing real value – delivering an exceptional service and experience comes first. We believe that if we get this right, the business will naturally thrive. We’re as generous as possible with our clients, always looking for ways to support them, listen to their needs, and help them achieve their goals. This client-first mentality, combined with our commitment to quality and community, is what contributes to our success. We’re not in the Pilates business – we’re in the people business.

 Tell us about your local brand partnerships – how do they fit into your mission?

 Wati: Partnership, for us, is about doing more for our clients—enhancing their experience, showing appreciation, and supporting the community that supports us. It’s also about mutual respect and uplifting the incredible businesses around us. We love collaborating with brands that share our values of wellness, community, and authenticity. Our partners include Jones Road Beauty, Bloom Nutrition, Skincare by Sol, Talea Beer Co., ON Running, Tony Moly, and other local businesses that make Williamsburg so vibrant.

 As an Asian American-owned business, we’re proud to support immigrant-founded and minority-owned brands that reflect the rich culture of our neighborhood. What makes these partnerships even more meaningful is that many of the founders, owners, and staff are also clients – each on their own fitness journey. These relationships go beyond business – they’re built on shared values, mutual support, and a belief in the power of movement to connect and uplift.

 

 You’re now planning a second location in Long Island City – what drew you to that neighborhood?

 Jason: LIC reminds us of Williamsburg a decade ago – growing fast, diverse, and filled with creative, health-conscious residents. It’s a natural next step for us to build a second studio that reflects the same energy and integrity we brought to Brooklyn. Jason is originally from Queens – a NYC native since day one – and his very first apartment was in Long Island City. So opening the first Studio Pilates location in the borough feels especially meaningful. In many ways, this expansion feels like coming full circle. And let’s be honest – Queens has the best food in all of NYC! We’re also deeply committed to growing from within. This expansion allows us to create new leadership opportunities and support our team as they advance both professionally and personally. Helping people reach their full potential – whether they’re clients or staff – is at the heart of everything we do.

 As you grow, how do you plan to maintain the community-driven culture that defines your Williamsburg studio?

 Wati: We’re creating systems to scale our personal touch—from how we onboard clients to how we train staff. We’ll continue hosting local events, offering tailored experiences, and staying hands-on. Culture doesn’t happen by accident – it’s nurtured daily. While our studios are only a few miles apart, NYC is incredibly vast – with countless cultures and communities in every direction. What unites our clients, no matter where they come from, is a shared commitment to health and wellness. From how they move to what they consume, our clients are intentional about how they live. It’s exciting to build a community around those shared values – one that feels authentic to each neighborhood we serve.

 Where do you see the Studio Pilates brand – and your role in it – five years from now?

 Wati: We see ourselves leading a small network of community-first studios across NYC and possibly beyond. Jason will stay focused on operations, culture, and partnerships. I will continue to guide our financial growth and strategy. Our goal is to inspire more people to move, heal, and connect.

 Finally, what does success look like to you – as business owners, community members, and a family?

 Jason: To us, success is alignment – doing meaningful work we’re passionate about, staying true to our values, and having time for our loved ones and each other. It’s about building a life where we’re growing as individuals, as a couple, and alongside our community.

 As business owners, success means running a sustainable and thriving studio – one where we can pay our team, ourselves, and our bills without stress, so we can focus on what really matters: supporting our clients in their wellness journey and encouraging them to move with purpose.

 As community members, it’s about contributing to the neighborhood in a positive way – creating opportunities, championing local businesses, and being part of something bigger than ourselves. And as a family, success is about making memories, showing up for each other, and building a life filled with love, joy, and shared purpose. Ultimately, success is being a catalyst for good in someone else’s life – whether big or small and finding joy in the process.
