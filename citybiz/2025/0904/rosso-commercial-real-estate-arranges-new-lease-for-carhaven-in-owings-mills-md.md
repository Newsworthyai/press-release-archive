# Rosso Commercial Real Estate Arranges New Lease for CarHaven in Owings Mills, MD

Rosso Commercial Real Estate (RossoCRE), a results-driven boutique commercial real estate brokerage and advisory firm headquartered in Annapolis, MD, is pleased to announce it has successfully arranged a new lease on behalf of CarHaven, a locally owned pre-owned vehicle dealership known for quality cars and exceptional customer service.

 CarHaven will be relocating from Millersville, MD to its new home at 11405 Reisterstown Road in Owings Mills, MD, a 13,000 square foot auto dealership situated on 1.7 acres along one of Baltimore County’s most active commercial corridors.

 “The Rosso Commercial team made this transition seamless, helping us secure the perfect location to continue serving our customers,” said Steve Travers, Owner of CarHaven.

 CarHaven was referred to Ryan Brassel of Rosso Commercial to guide the site selection and relocation process. After conducting a thorough market search throughout the region, Brassel identified the second-generation automotive property on Reisterstown Road as a terrific opportunity for CarHaven to expand its visibility and reach in the marketplace.

 “CarHaven has a great reputation for trust and transparency with its customers, and we were honored to help them find a new home that positions the business for continued success in the years ahead,” said Brassel.

 This new location provides CarHaven with excellent frontage, strong traffic counts, and the infrastructure to support its growing operations.

 For the record: Ryan Brassel at RossoCRE represented Car Haven and worked in collaboration with Geoff Mackler & John Schultz at HR Retail, who represented the Landlord in this transaction.
