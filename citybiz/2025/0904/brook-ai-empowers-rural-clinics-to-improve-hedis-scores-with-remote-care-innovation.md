# Brook.ai Empowers Rural Clinics to Improve HEDIS Scores with Remote Care Innovation

Brook.ai, a leader in remote patient monitoring (RPM) & care management, today announced how its comprehensive remote care platform is helping healthcare providers, particularly those in rural areas, consistently hit crucial Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality measures and secure the incentive payments tied to them. Even when clinicians deliver excellent care, the paperwork needed to tick every HEDIS box can mean missed incentive dollars and strained small-practice budgets.

 “Working with the Brook team has been amazing for our practice. They’ve increased our patient health outcome goals,” commented Lindsay Bryant, COO at the Office of Dr. Christopher Beney, MD. “We’re held to certain standards in primary care, and we have measures that we are required to meet. Brook has helped increase our measures.”

 Brook.ai’s platform combines remote patient monitoring technology with dedicated care teams to help practices track and improve HEDIS measures throughout the year. The company’s approach goes beyond traditional remote monitoring by integrating AI-powered patient engagement with human care coordination to ensure patients receive preventive care, complete necessary screenings, and maintain medication adherence.

 Key features of Brook.ai’s quality measure support include:

 * Home-based blood-pressure monitoring ensures the two required readings under 140 mm Hg for previously uncontrolled patients are captured and documented directly in the EMR
* Proactive patient outreach for preventive screenings like diabetic eye exams and mammograms supports preventive-care HEDIS measures
* Medication adherence monitoring and support closes refill gaps quickly to meet HEDIS medication adherence requirements
* Monthly check-ins track key health metrics and identify gaps in care and flag emerging issues early so practices can close care gaps
* Care team support for patient education and engagement ensures accurate data capture and keeps patients on track with their care plans

 The platform is particularly valuable for rural healthcare providers participating in value-based care models, including Medicare innovation programs. These providers can leverage Brook.ai’s remote care capabilities to maintain quality standards despite geographical challenges and staffing limitations.

 University of Buffalo Medical Doctors’ (UBMD) experience with Brook.ai puts that value in action. Since onboarding Brook.ai, the group has maintained audit-ready HEDIS compliance for over a year with zero audit findings—demonstrating that Brook’s workflows keep every required data point documented and review-ready. By streamlining patient outreach, continuous vital-sign monitoring, and proactive reminders, Brook.ai enabled UBMD to meet every required screening, blood-pressure check, and medication-adherence metric—closing care gaps before year-end and protecting incentive payments tied to HEDIS performance.

 “Brook.ai’s platform has dramatically lightened the administrative load on our clinical teams—freeing us to focus on patient care instead of paperwork,” said Kevin Hughes, MD, a primary care physician at UBMD’s Primary Physicians Group. “What began as a single-site pilot in Tonawanda has now expanded to three more locations, and our physicians are more confident than ever that every HEDIS measure is being met.”

 “Healthcare providers, especially those in rural areas, face significant challenges in meeting quality measures while dealing with staffing shortages and limited resources,” said Oren Nissim, CEO and Co-Founder of Brook.ai. “Our platform helps bridge these gaps by extending the reach of clinical teams through a combination of technology and human support, ensuring patients receive consistent care management while practices maintain compliance with quality measures.”
