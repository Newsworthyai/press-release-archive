# Charlestown Artists Paint a Beautiful Mural for All to Enjoy

By Danielle Rexrode

 Painter Pablo Picasso once said, “Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.” But for Charlestown, an Erickson Senior Living community in Catonsville, Md., art also has the power to conceal it.

 Charlestown’s Fireside Artists recently painted vibrant works of art to cover the temporary construction walls installed in the community’s Fountain Hill neighborhood during renovations, transforming the space into a beautiful gallery.   “Mary Evans, the community resources manager, approached me and said they wanted to brighten up the hallway while the construction was ongoing,” says resident Sandy Mack, president of the Fireside Artists.

 Over the course of a month, Sandy–along with seven other members of the Fireside Artists–lined the hallway in Fountain Hill, paintbrushes in hand, creating colorful depictions of landscapes, flowers, wildlife, and scenes representing life at Charlestown.

 Creative collaboration

 The Fireside Artists are a group of 72 residents who paint, draw, sculpt, and make jewelry.

 Much of their artwork is featured throughout the state of Maryland in art galleries, public libraries, college art departments, and business venues. Their work is also featured year-round in the community’s gallery, located in the Charlestown Square Clubhouse.

 “But this is the first time we collaborated on a group project like this. I have never worked on a canvas this big,” says Sandy.

 “The area was busy during the day, so we painted in the evenings and on the weekends. There was a lot of enthusiasm and positive feedback from residents and staff who passed by while we were painting.”

 The 2-by-6-foot panels, stretching 50 feet, were painted using acrylic paint. The artists discussed their ideas beforehand and submitted their concepts for review–and the results speak for themselves.

 “Charlestown residents and staff enjoyed watching the evolution of the artwork,” says Evans. “Many residents made it a part of their daily schedule to go and observe the artists at work, stopping by in the evenings to chat and learn more about the vision for each piece.”

 ‘A lot of fun’

 Sandy completed thirteen panels, which include a village with colorful houses and a clothesline, Japanese cherry blossoms against a blended blue background, and abstract dancers wearing textured skirts with exaggerated arms and legs.

 “I would paint for about five hours at a time. It was a lot of fun and even therapeutic,” says Sandy.

 Former elementary school art teacher Lynn Kochis, who had not painted in over 40 years, agreed to work on three paintings for the mural.

 “I hadn’t done anything like this for a very long time and knew this would be a wonderful creative outlet,” says Lynn, who typically works with colored pencils.

 Working together

 Together, Lynn and Sandy collaborated on a painting of a large tree spanning six panels. Sandy painted the ground while Lynn painted the tree, complete with a squirrel hole and a squirrel.

 “It was just plain fun to watch the creations come to life. Plus, it was great to hear comments from passersby while working,” says Lynn. “All the feedback was extremely positive. People thanked us for doing the murals, and the staff enjoyed watching and chatting with us while we painted.”

 Lynn also contributed a painting of a whimsical flower and, her favorite, a portrait of Mickey Mouse.

 “I love the creative process–figuring out how to best execute each piece. It really keeps my mind engaged,” says Lynn.

 Sharing talents

 Evans notes that Charlestown residents are always eager to share their gifts and talents while giving back to the community.

 “This group of residents brought so much joy, beauty, and harmony to the community through their work,” says Evans. “In fact, we have a painting night scheduled for Sandy to teach participants how to paint her ‘dancing ladies.'”

 The Fireside Artists’ work will remain on display until the renovations at Fountain Hill are completed in 2026. Once finished, the community will boast two new dining venues–a cafe and a full-service restaurant with a bar, an updated outdoor seating area, and a firepit.

 The larger renovation plan also includes a new expanded music room and library as well as a multipurpose gathering space for various activities, including indoor pickleball.

 In the meantime, residents and staff members continue to enjoy the beautiful artwork created by their Charlestown neighbors–a true win-win!

 “It was fun to do something we love to do while also bringing joy to the residents of our community,” says Sandy.
