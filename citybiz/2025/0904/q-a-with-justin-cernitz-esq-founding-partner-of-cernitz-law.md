# Q&amp;A with Justin Cernitz, Esq., Founding Partner of Cernitz Law

As founding partner of Cernitz Law, Justin Cernitz, Esq. counsels and represents clients on a variety of legal issues, specializing in first-party property insurance disputes and bad faith litigation. He also has represented numerous clients on issues relating to medical malpractice, personal injury and catastrophic injury, wrongful death, and nursing home negligence. He founded the practice in 2010.

 He and his wife, Cernitz Law Managing Partner Candise Shanbron, have organically built the firm by word of mouth and referrals to be a highly successful property damage practice. Today, the firm serves high-end homeowners as well as commercial property owners in Florida, New York and Texas with local offices in each state. Since 2010, Cernitz Law has represented thousands of clients who have had insurance claims on their properties denied or underpaid, as well as accident and injury victims.

 Can you tell us about your backstory and what inspired you to start Cernitz Law?

 I was raised on the South Shore of Long Island, New York, where my father built his career as an attorney representing insurance companies. It’s somewhat poetic that I chose a path advocating on behalf of clients against those same companies—something my father actually encouraged. His guidance played a big role in shaping my journey.

 From early on, I knew I wanted to pursue law, largely influenced by watching my dad’s dedication and professionalism—an experience many can relate to when they follow a parent’s lead. My passion for law and government eventually brought me to Emory University, where I majored in political science. Along the way, I developed a strong interest in how businesses function and are managed. I had a clear vision: one day, I wanted to run my own law firm. So, I dove into learning everything I could, not only about law and policy but also the inner workings of successful business operations. Of course, I later discovered that theory doesn’t always translate seamlessly into practice.

 In 2010, that vision became a reality when I launched Cernitz Law. Since then, we’ve proudly represented thousands of clients, many of whom have faced denied or underpaid insurance claims, along with victims of accidents and injuries.

 In an industry often marked by superficial service and sales-driven promises, Cernitz Law stands out through genuine dedication, bold thinking and proven results. We reject the notion of “standard” legal work. Each case is met with customized strategies and innovative approaches tailored to the unique challenges at hand. We don’t simply check boxes or go through the motions; instead, we collaborate closely to bring creativity and deep insight to every matter.

 Unlike many firms that shy away from complex or high-stakes claims, we embrace these challenges head-on, recognizing that real problem-solving requires commitment and courage. In a world where many seek the easiest path, we dive deep, uncovering the critical details and nuances that others overlook. Our experience representing insurance companies gives us a distinct advantage: we understand their tactics and know how to effectively counter them. This insider perspective allows us to outmaneuver insurers and fiercely advocate for our clients.

 What types of cases do you see most often, and why are these claims so challenging for homeowners and businesses?

 At our firm, we frequently handle hurricane and windstorm claims. While these cases may not be particularly complex from a legal or technical standpoint, they are often the most difficult for homeowners and business owners. That’s because policyholders tend to view these claims in straightforward, black-and-white terms. Their policies clearly provide coverage for wind and hurricane-related damage, so when losses occur, they reasonably expect the insurance company to process and pay the claim without unnecessary complications.

 However, what many don’t realize is how insurance companies operate behind the scenes. Their profitability often hinges on delaying or denying valid claims—not because they’re targeting individuals, but because minimizing payouts is part of a broader business strategy. This becomes especially problematic during catastrophic events like hurricanes, when thousands of claims are filed at once. The sheer volume gives insurers even more incentive to delay payments or offer low settlements, despite the fact that people’s lives have been upended. For the policyholder, the impact is anything but impersonal—they’re simply trying to recover and rebuild, often while facing mounting financial and emotional stress. The disconnect between policyholder expectations and insurer practices can be a major source of frustration during an already difficult time.

 Given your team’s prior experience working for insurance companies, how does that give your clients an advantage?

 Our team brings a unique perspective to the table, one that allows us to anticipate the strategies and tactics commonly used by insurance companies. This insight gives us a significant advantage over attorneys who lack this specialized experience. We understand how these companies operate, recognize their patterns, and know exactly how to counter their efforts to delay or deny valid claims. It’s this deep, strategic understanding that enables us to advocate effectively for our clients and secure the outcomes they deserve.

 After a natural disaster, what are the biggest mistakes you see policyholders make when filing a claim?

 One of the biggest mistakes policyholders make is trusting that the insurance company will simply do the right thing. While it may seem reasonable to expect fairness, the reality is that insurers are businesses first, and their goal is to minimize payouts whenever possible. Another common misstep is failing to document communications. Insurance adjusters often prefer verbal conversations, but that can lead to misunderstandings or disputes down the line. My number one rule: If it’s not in writing, it doesn’t exist.

 Other critical errors include delaying the claim report, failing to take comprehensive photos or videos of the damage, or making repairs—temporary or otherwise—before giving the insurance company an opportunity to inspect. These oversights can severely impact the outcome of a claim and leave policyholders at a disadvantage during an already stressful time.

 What advice would you give homeowners to avoid underpaid or denied insurance claims?

 Engaging a good, reputable and experienced law firm, such as Cernitz Law, can make a significant difference when handling insurance claims. We have successfully represented thousands of policyholders facing denied or underpaid claims, helping them secure the coverage they deserve. With our expertise, clients have been able to obtain full compensation needed to properly repair their damages and move forward with confidence.

 What role does communication and accessibility play in your client relationships?

 At our firm, we approach each client’s claim as if they were a member of our own family, always putting their needs first. Many clients have chosen to leave other firms because they felt neglected or were passed off to non-attorney staff, leading to frustration and lack of communication. Unlike that, we view our clients as individuals, not just case numbers. Our goal is to build lasting relationships grounded in trust, transparency, and open communication—even long after their cases have been resolved.

 How has the legal landscape for property damage and insurance claims changed over the past few years, and how do you adapt?

 In Florida, as in many other states, the climate has increasingly become unfavorable for policyholders. The legal system across the United States has become heavily influenced by politics to the point where traditional principles of law often take a backseat. Insurance companies have adeptly navigated this political landscape, especially in Florida, where a pro-insurer environment has enabled them to successfully lobby for the dismantling of crucial consumer protection laws. This has tilted the scales in what is essentially a David versus Goliath battle, with insurance companies issuing contracts of adhesion that heavily favor their interests.

 Despite these challenges, we remain steadfast in our commitment to fight for our clients. We continually innovate and develop creative legal strategies to overcome these obstacles. Our collaborative approach leverages the collective expertise of our team, recognizing that breakthrough ideas can come from any member. This teamwork is vital in ensuring we deliver the best possible outcomes in an often difficult and unbalanced legal landscape.

 As your firm expands across Florida and beyond, what are your goals for the future of Cernitz Law?

 Our goal is to consistently earn the trust and confidence of as many policyholders as possible by always doing right by our clients. We strive to nurture and maintain this important relationship for the long term, finding purpose and fulfillment in the meaningful work we do. This commitment continues to inspire us and fuels the passion we have always felt for advocating on behalf of those we serve.
