 The Distribution Agreements reflect Beyond Oil’s objective to align with exclusive strategic partners that are well positioned to deliver sustainable long-term growth as we continue to scale across Europe.

 “Pilpel’s rollout of our solution across four European countries, encompassing leading companies across the food service, QSR, and other industries, is a validation of our technology and our value proposition,” said Jonathan Or, CEO of Beyond Oil. “We are excited to be partnering with a European culinary leader that prioritizes food quality, health, sustainability and safety for its valued customers, and we look forward to working closely with the entire Pilpel team leadership to rapidly and efficiently scale distribution across their European network.”

 “Just as Beyond Oil conducted thorough due diligence on Pilpel, we also invested significant effort in evaluating this partnership,” said Doodi Hazut, CEO of Pilpel. “Our team visited Beyond Oil’s facilities in Israel, met with their leadership, engaged with long-time customers of the product, and met with Fandango, Beyond Oil’s exclusive distributor in Israel. Through this process, we gained a clear understanding of what it takes to be a successful Beyond Oil partner. We share the same values and are inspired to join their vision of creating healthier and more sustainable frying for people and the planet.”

 Rafi Orel, Project CEO, commented, “We are excited to join the Beyond oil family and believe Pilpel is well positioned to bring a sustainable long-term growth of Beyond Oil’s product across our territories.”
