# Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Broward County Unveil Symbolic Panther Sculpture for Panthers on the Prowl Campaign

Rita Case donated the statue to Boys & Girls Clubs of Broward County

 Four young artists from the Boys & Girls Clubs of Broward County’s Rita & Rick Case Club dedicated four weeks to decorating a panther sculpture generously donated by Rita Case, president and CEO of Rick Case Automotive Group. The artwork is part of Panthers on the Prowl, an initiative launched in collaboration with the American Cancer Society and Florida Panthers President Bill Zito and his wife Julie.

 Panthers on the Prowl merges art, community and philanthropy to raise funds for cancer research, patient services and advocacy programs.

 The passionate, artistic team of Gizele B., Samantha A., Valentina Laurel L. and Jeydilis L. from the Rita & Rick Case Boys & Girls Club, created a design that reflects Rita’s journey. Running along the panther’s back is a road lined with brand names of Case dealerships. Included in the design is the Florida Panthers logo, American Cancer Society pink socks, representing the courage it takes to fight cancer, and empowering words that highlight both cancer survivorship and the Boys & Girl Clubs’ mission. A Boys & Girls Clubs membership card dangles from a collar around the panther’s neck, signifying the organization’s dedication to youth and the broader community, while the panther’s striking golden eyes convey a sense of boldness and spirit.

 “We loved creating this panther because it wasn’t just about art. It was about showing how many people and organizations truly care,” said Natalie Chin Sue, lead art instructor. “Every part of it represents hope and the power to make change together.”

 The artists named their masterpiece Legacy on the Prowl to honor the impact Rita and Rick Case have on the community, highlight cancer research and awareness, and celebrate the Boys & Girls Clubs of Broward County’s lasting impact on youth across past, present and future generations.

 “I just love how these young artists came together to create this artwork which we hope will serve as a beacon of hope for cancer research and awareness,” said Rita Case. “I appreciate how they incorporated the Florida Panthers and our company’s journey because whether on blades or wheels, we both inspire the South Florida community to get around, get involved and make a positive impact through philanthropy.”
