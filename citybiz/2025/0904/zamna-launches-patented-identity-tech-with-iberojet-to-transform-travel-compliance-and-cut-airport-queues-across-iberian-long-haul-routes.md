# Zamna Launches Patented Identity Tech with Iberojet to Transform Travel Compliance and Cut Airport Queues Across Iberian Long-Haul Routes

* Iberojet will validate passenger documentation through Zamna in a major first for identity technology
* Zamna’s upstream infrastructure verifies passengers before they fly—eliminating 100% of documentation fines and unlocking new data for airline operations

 London software company Zamna has today announced the launch of its patented identity infrastructure with Spanish and Portuguese airline Iberojet, part of Ávoris Corporación Empresarial.

 The deployment forms a central part of Iberojet’s broader digital transformation strategy, aimed at cutting queues, reducing manual checks, and ensuring compliance at scale as international travel rules tighten.

 Operating seamlessly and in real-time, Zamna’s unique patented technology pre-validates passports, boarding passes, and travel documents days or even weeks before travellers arrive at the airport. It ensures compliance with each destination’s specific entry requirements and provides passengers with early visibility if anything needs correcting.

 Within the first month of operation, more than 60% of passengers who checked in online entered the Zamna flow, and nearly 70% of them were fully verified to fly in advance. Of the few passengers (5%) who were not verified, nearly 70% failed the check due to simple discrepancies in identification. For the first time, Iberojet now has advance visibility into the reasons why identity checks fail, even before passengers arrive at the airport. Zamna flags these issues in advance, enabling airlines to take proactive action and reduce last-minute manual interventions.

 Irra Ariella Khi, CEO and Co-Founder at Zamna, commented: “This deployment isn’t just about smoother check-in; it’s about taking the regulatory and financial liability for doc checks away from airlines. We are not only automating checks against travel rules and unlocking digital boarding passes. Zamna removes 100% of fines from invalid visas, mismatched IDs, or missed eTAs. As travel rules tighten, and more destinations impose strict and fast-changing entry requirements, airlines need solutions that guarantee compliance at scale. Zamna does exactly that and we take full liability for getting it right.”

 The system is already live on Iberojet’s long-haul routes from the Iberian Peninsula, Spain and Portugal to Latin America and the Caribbean, including Mexico, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Honduras and to other destinations. Expansion is planned for return journeys into Europe, as well as additional routes.

 The fully configured deployment was designed to align with Iberojet’s existing tech stack and operational processes, including a custom-branded WebView embedded directly within the airline’s relaunched online check-in experience. Once a booking is made, the system inspects it, requests the necessary documentation, checks destination-specific travel rules, and validates immigration or entry requirements as needed.

 Toni Pou Mir, BT & IT Director Iberojet, shared: We’ve seen the potential of this tool firsthand — reducing the check-in process from over an hour to under thirty minutes. We witnessed it happen in real time. Partnering with Zamna has eased the pressure on our frontline teams, reduced queues, and made the process more intuitive for passengers. Even in complex cases, the system manages compliance seamlessly in the background, allowing our staff to focus their time and energy where it truly matters. It’s a smarter, more human way to operate.”
