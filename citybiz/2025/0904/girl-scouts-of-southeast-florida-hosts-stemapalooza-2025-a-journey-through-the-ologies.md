Community gathered for a night of hands-on STEM exploration at the Museum of Discovery and Science

 Girl Scouts of Southeast Florida’s highly anticipated STEMapalooza 2025: Ology Overload transformed the Museum of Discovery and Science into an evening filled with discovery, imagination and innovation.

 The annual event drew 250 Girl Scouts, students, families and community members from across South Florida for a one-of-a-kind, after-hours experience exploring an array of fascinating “-ologies.”

 Guests journeyed through immersive exhibits in biology, astronomy, geology, criminology, meteorology, oceanography and more while connecting with experts in their fields. They enjoyed hands-on activities including marine biology and art with the Guy Harvey Foundation; meteorology with WSVN Channel 7’s Vivian Gonzalez; kinetology with Mad Science, electrology with The Dennis Project; entomology with Truly Nolen; criminology with the Broward Sheriff’s Office; oceanography with the Marine Research Hub; geology with the Women of Asphalt Florida Organization and more. Guests also enjoyed private access to the museum’s exhibits, including Expedition Dinosaur – Rise of the Mammals, Dino Dana Adventures, Florida Ecoscapes, Otters at Play, Storm Center and more, along with interactive experiments, live demonstrations, and a documentary screening in the IMAX theater.
