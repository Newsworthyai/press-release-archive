# Bergen County Residents Make the Move to Cedar Crest

By Susan Ingram

 Ann Bernhard, a longtime Oakland, N.J., resident, is one of hundreds of Bergen County retirees who decided to move to Cedar Crest, an Erickson Senior Living community in Pompton Plains, N.J.

 It’s a popular choice, notes Sales Director Ray Guarino. “About 18% of people who moved here last year were from Bergen County,” he says.

 “I think many prospective residents see that we are in a terrific location, with convenient access to Interstate 287 and Route 208,” Guarino explains. “Residents who called Bergen County home can easily connect with longtime friends or attend services at the church they’ve been going to for years.”

 He adds, “Our range of amenities is another factor. The on-campus fitness center, library, creative arts studio, woodshop, TV studio, and more are all just a short stroll away. Many of them can even be accessed without going outdoors via our climate-controlled walkways.”

 For Ann, who formerly served as president of the robust Oakland Senior Center, Cedar Crest’s range of amenities and activities were indeed very appealing–especially when paired with the community’s one-level, maintenance-free residences.

 ‘Just what I needed’ Ann and her late husband, who became Oakland residents in 1969, were living just 20 minutes away from Cedar Crest when it opened in 2001.

 As a Bergen County real estate agent for four decades, Ann became quite familiar with the community. “I brought people up to Cedar Crest all the time and referred them,” she recalls.

 After living in her two-story condo, with 13 steps to the main level and 13 more to the bedrooms, she began wondering if a one-level home would make more sense in retirement–especially after incurring an injury.

 “I broke my hip showing friends how to dance at the senior center!” recalls Ann, who then scheduled a tour at the nearby community.

 “I brought my three daughters up here with me, and they loved it immediately. They really loved it,” Ann says. “And deep down, I thought, ‘They’re right,’ because Cedar Crest was just what I needed. We all agreed that it was perfect for what I wanted.”

 Making the move Eager to secure her place in line for an extra-large, one-bedroom residence, Ann joined Cedar Crest’s Priority List.

 The perks of the Priority List also include invitations to exclusive events, seminars, and luncheons; a first look at news and community updates; and access to the Live the Life program, which allows guests to stay overnight in a furnished suite, dine at restaurants, and attend club meetings.

 Ann, however, eager to embrace her new worry-free lifestyle, bypassed some perks and expedited her move.

 “I was on the Priority List for three weeks, sold my house, and moved in–all in 40 days,” she notes. “My new home is on the sixth floor with a great view. I love to look at the moon.”

 An active lifestyle While Bergen County natives can visit their old stomping grounds whenever they’d like, there’s so much to do at Cedar Crest–especially with all the time-consuming hassles of homeownership left behind.

 From dining at on-campus restaurants with neighbors to pursuing new hobbies through clubs and activities, there’s plenty of opportunities to socialize and stay engaged.

 “There’s so much here. It’s amazing! I love all of the activities at Cedar Crest to keep my mind going,” says Ann. “You meet so many people. I love the idea of meeting all different people, because when you’re a senior, sometimes it’s hard to meet new friends. This is the perfect place to meet people–people that you want to be with.”

 Now, Ann plays mah-jongg, bocce, and canasta. “I wanted to test them all out,” she notes.

 “And, ironically,” she adds, “the girl I was playing bridge with in Oakland made a last-minute decision, moving to Cedar Crest three days after I did, which was wonderful. So, in those first few days, we were able to do everything together, which was a great way to start out our new lives.”
