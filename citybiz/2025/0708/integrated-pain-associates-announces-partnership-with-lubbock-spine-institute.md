# Integrated Pain Associates Announces Partnership With Lubbock Spine Institute

Integrated Pain Associates (“IPA”), a Triton Pacific Healthcare Partners portfolio company, is pleased to announce a partnership with Lubbock Spine Institute (“LSI”), a leading provider of interventional spine and pain management services across West Texas with 21 physicians and advanced practice providers.

 Headquartered in Killeen, TX and with locations across the state, IPA has significantly expanded its geographic reach since its partnership with Triton Pacific in 2023 and continues to fulfill its mission of addressing unmet need in underserved areas. In partnership with LSI, the platform expands its footprint to include Lubbock, Midland, and Amarillo, TX. Patients will benefit from increased access to a broad array of minimally invasive procedures and therapies that are provided outside of hospitals and target the root causes of pain.

 “The pain management space has undergone a meaningful evolution, shifting away from the archaic dichotomy between invasive surgeries and medication management to center on minimally invasive procedures that produce better outcomes,” commented Dr. Scott Irvine, President of IPA. “IPA and LSI share a commitment to advancing this superior clinical model and providing best-in-class care for our patients.”

 While clinical innovation has created substantial opportunity, operational complexity and limited access to training have prevented many pain management practices from participating in this evolution. Elodie Day, CEO of IPA, noted: “We view ourselves not only as a forerunner but also as a driver of the paradigm shift. The partnership between IPA and LSI provides even greater impetus behind our efforts. LSI is strongly aligned with our vision and brings a highly skilled team of providers that are ideally equipped to help promote our shared goals.”

 Dr. Bolkar Sahinler of LSI commented: “We are immensely excited to partner with IPA. This is an opportunity for us to participate in building a truly differentiated platform where clinical excellence and strategic thinking converge. With the combined capabilities of IPA and LSI, we anticipate meaningful benefits for both patients and providers.”

 Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Florac and Star Mountain participated as significant investors in the platform. DLA Piper, led by Sal Favuzza and Joshua Kaye, advised IPA and Triton Pacific. Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, led by Scott Schwartz and Paul Carr-Rollitt, advised LSI.
