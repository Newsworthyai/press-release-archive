# Lincoln Delivers 1.6 Million SF Goodyear AirPark Phase I

Full-service commercial real estate firm Lincoln Property Company (Lincoln) and Scottsdale-based Harvard Investments have announced the delivery of Goodyear AirPark Phase I, a 1.6 million-square-foot, six-building Class A industrial project designed to meet Phoenix’s evolving demand for mid- to large-scale industrial space.

 Reflecting the project’s ongoing development, the companies have also initiated development on Estrella Gateway, the retail portion of Goodyear AirPark that, at completion, will span 63 acres and up to 15 pads to accommodate full-service retail tenants.

 Located at the main entrance to Estrella Mountain Ranch and accessed by the MC 85 and future State Route 30 / Tres Rios Freeway, Estrella Gateway will offer everyday convenience for park employees and the almost 440,000 residents living within a 10 mile radius.

 Development of the retail pads at Estrella Gateway will kick off with construction of a Quick Trip (QT) Travel Center, situated on approximately five acres at the southwest corner of Estrella Parkway and State Route MC 85. Lincoln and Harvard completed the land sale to QT during Q1 2025. Construction on the travel center is scheduled to begin during Q4 2025.

 Goodyear AirPark is strategically located between the Estrella Mountain Ranch master-planned community, Phoenix-Goodyear Airport and Goodyear Civic Square – or GSQ – the city’s emerging urban core. It also sits adjacent to the future Tres Rios Freeway/State Route 30, a planned reliever for I-10 running 29 miles south of I-10 from the Durango Curve on I-17 to State Route 85 in Buckeye.

 “Goodyear AirPark delivers at a time when Goodyear is advancing on all fronts as a true live-work-play community,” said Lincoln Senior Executive Vice President David Krumwiede. “This project adds a strong industrial base and a unique retail offering to that growth, making Goodyear attractive to the major employers and industries that create long-term stability.”

 Goodyear AirPark Phase I is located within the 565-acre Goodyear AirPark master plan, ultimately slated to include approximately 7 million square feet in up to 20 buildings. Targeting mid- and large-scale users, Phase I includes six buildings ranging from 81,000 to 775,000 square feet. Each building features up to 40’ clear height, a total of 327 dock-high and 28 drive-in doors, private truck courts, and generous car and trailer parking in a secured lot.

 “Goodyear AirPark adds critical industrial inventory to one of the Valley’s fastest-growing submarkets,” said Lincoln Executive Vice President John Orsak. “Its divisibility to 20,000 square feet and expansive connectivity support logistics, advanced manufacturing and semiconductor uses of all types and sizes, as well as data centers – a market sector in which Phoenix ranks as a U.S. leader.”

 Goodyear AirPark Phase I was delivered with full utilities infrastructure and zoning for industrial and commercial use, making it a leading speed-to-market option.

 Designed and constructed by award-winning firms Butler Design Group and Stevens-Leinweber Construction, Inc., Goodyear AirPark sits three miles south of Interstate 10, minutes from the award-winning Estrella Mountain Ranch community and Goodyear Ballpark. It is bordered by Estrella Parkway, Bullard Avenue and State Route MC 85, a high-volume east/west trucking route connecting Goodyear with Mexico.

 Major industrial neighbors include Microsoft, Amazon, UPS, Walmart, Boeing, SubZero, Daimler-Benz, XPO Logistics, Red Bull and Aldi.
