 New Orleans Top Workplaces

 Energage named Universal Parking a winner of the Greater New Orleans Top Workplaces 2025 award. This list is based solely on employee feedback gathered through a third-party survey administered by Energage. The confidential survey uniquely measures the employee experience and its component themes, including employees feeling Respected & Supported, Enabled to Grow, and Empowered to Execute, among others.

 “Earning a Top Workplaces award is a badge of honor for companies, especially because it comes authentically from their employees,” said Eric Rubino, Energage CEO. “That’s something to be proud of. In today’s market, leaders must ensure they’re allowing employees to have a voice and be heard. That’s paramount. Top Workplaces do this, and it pays dividends.”
