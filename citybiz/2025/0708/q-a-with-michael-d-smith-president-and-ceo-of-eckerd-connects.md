 Congratulations on your recent appointment as President & CEO of Eckerd Connects! While this is a new role for you, you’ve led a variety of organizations in the past, ranging from grassroots nonprofits to a $4 billion federal agency. What drew you to Eckerd Connects, and why is this next chapter right for you?

 Eckerd Connects sits at the intersection of some of our country’s greatest challenges and greatest opportunities: youth connection, economic mobility, workforce development, and family stability. What drew me wasn’t just the mission—it was the moment.

 We have a rare chance to build on a powerful legacy while stepping into a future that demands bold thinking, relentless execution, and deep alignment with purpose. Eckerd Connects has a high-caliber team, a proven structure, and deep community trust—all anchored by a national footprint and a mission-driven workforce that does what works, even when it requires agility and adaptability.

 How did your early experiences shape your path into public service?

 I grew up in a community that lacked material wealth but was rich in love, service, and responsibility. From a young age, the Family Center Boys & Girls Club became my second home and introduced me to the idea that service isn’t something you do later in life—it’s something you live every day.

 That early exposure shaped everything. It taught me that leadership doesn’t come from titles or credentials—it comes from showing up, rolling up your sleeves, and letting shared values and lived experiences guide the work. That sense of proximity and purpose has grounded every step of my journey.

 Eckerd Connects has long been known for its direct services. Under your leadership, it’s shifting from being a “server” to a “solver.” What does that transformation look like in practice?

 At Eckerd Connects, our frontline staff are both servers and solvers. Every day, they show up for those who need us most—meeting immediate needs while also pursuing systemic solutions. That dual commitment is what makes Eckerd Connects both inspirational in our impact and aspirational in our vision.

 Becoming a national “solver” means we continue delivering high-quality, life-changing services on the ground—but we don’t stop there. We assess our data systems, examine what’s working, and elevate best practices to inform policy, design more equitable systems, and build the partnerships needed to scale what works. It’s about taking what we’ve learned at the community level and applying it to address the root causes of the challenges we see each day.

 That’s the kind of leadership Eckerd Connects is stepping into—visionary, grounded, and driven by the people and purpose at the heart of everything we do.

 What are your top priorities for your first 100 days, and how are you setting the tone for this new era of leadership?

 My first 100 days are focused on listening deeply. I’m traveling to our programs across 21 states, speaking directly with our staff, partners, and the people we serve. I want to understand our core strengths, where we’re feeling stretched, and where there’s untapped opportunity.

 We’re also moving from planning to implementation—advancing our strategic vision with a sharper focus. That means investing in our people, strengthening our communications, building new partnerships, and creating the conditions for sustainability and growth. We’re setting the tone for a culture that’s clear-eyed about challenges and energized by the possibilities ahead.

 You’ve spoken about your growth from a Boys & Girls Club kid to a public service leader. How does that personal experience shape your vision for impact?

 Having a leader who is proximate to the people they serve isn’t just a value—it’s a strategy. I lead with empathy and urgency—as do so many of my colleagues—because we’ve walked in the shoes of our clients and know how one organization, one individual can help change lives and transform communities. That personal lens keeps me focused on outcomes that matter: a first job, a credential, a college degree, a second chance, a sense of belonging. When we design systems around real lives—not just ideals—we unlock human potential at scale.

 How are you thinking about innovation and cross-sector partnerships as part of your long-term strategy?

 Lasting solutions require all of us—public, private, and nonprofit sectors—working together. No one sector can do it alone. Innovation happens at the intersection: where government meets community, where philanthropy meets lived experience, where business meets purpose.

 At Eckerd Connects, we’re going to be intentional about co-creating solutions with employers, donors, agencies, and local partners. That means aligning incentives, sharing data, and focusing on outcomes that matter. Whether it’s preparing youth for careers, helping families stay together, or rethinking how services are delivered, we’ll be doing it in authentic collaboration with others.

 What are the most urgent challenges facing the populations you serve, and where do you see opportunities to drive meaningful, lasting change?

 Our communities are navigating overlapping crises—mental health challenges, educational gaps, economic precarity, and a loss of social connection. But within those challenges lie real opportunities.

 Young people today are demanding systems that see and support the whole person. That opens the door to integrate healing into workforce systems, expand how we think about career pathways, and invest in relationships.

 Guided by data, grounded in community, and strengthened by partnership, we’re building lasting pathways to opportunity.

 What advice would you offer to young people navigating adversity who want to lead, serve, and transform the systems around them?

 Don’t wait for permission to lead. Your experience—your voice—is a superpower. Surround yourself with people who challenge and uplift you. Stay curious. Stay grounded. And don’t be afraid to imagine a different future.

 The world doesn’t need perfect leaders—it needs persistent ones. Keep showing up. Keep believing in what’s possible. You have more power than you know—and more people cheering you on than you think.
