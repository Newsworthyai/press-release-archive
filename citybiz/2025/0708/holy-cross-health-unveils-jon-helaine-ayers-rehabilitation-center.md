# Holy Cross Health Unveils Jon &amp; Helaine Ayers Rehabilitation Center

The recently renovated outpatient rehabilitation center is the only facility in Broward County with many unique therapies that help patients regain and improve their mobility and balance

 Holy Cross Health celebrated the blessing and unveiling of the Jon & Helaine Ayers Rehabilitation Center with a special dedication ceremony and ribbon cutting.

 Previously known as the Outpatient Rehabilitation Center, Holy Cross Health completely renovated the facility and significantly invested in state-of-the-art physical rehabilitation equipment, thanks to a generous $2 million gift from Jon and Helaine Ayers.

 As part of this capital project, Holy Cross Health introduced eight new pieces of equipment. Holy Cross is the only facility in Broward County with many of these unique therapies that help patients regain and improve their mobility and balance.

 “Jon and Helaine’s support has helped shape the future of Holy Cross Health in lasting and meaningful ways,” said Pierre Monice, MBA, FACHE, President and CEO of Holy Cross Health. “Jon and Helaine believe in our mission and in the people we serve. This new space represents the very best of what healthcare can be – compassionate, innovative and focused on the whole person.”

 The Center provides expert care in physical, occupational and speech therapy for patients recovering from strokes, brain and spinal cord injuries or are living with Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and more. The care model is rooted in a one-on-one, team-based approach that addresses not only the physical side of recovery, but also the emotional and cognitive journey each patient experiences.

 “I am deeply grateful to Jon and Helaine Ayers for their generosity. This Center is possible because of their incredible support and commitment to improving patient care,” said Laura Denoux, vice president and chief development officer at Holy Cross Health. “This is more than a building. It is a place where patients will regain strength, mobility and confidence.”

 Located at the main hospital in Fort Lauderdale, the welcoming and comfortable environment ensures an unparalleled rehabilitation experience for patients and their families.

 “This Center is positioned to be a leader in the treatment of neurologic, vestibular, oncologic and complex orthopedic conditions. We are ecstatic to have this technology at our disposal to provide our patients with the best chance at making significant and complete recoveries,” said Tim Day, Director of Outpatient Rehab for Holy Cross Health. “My team and I are looking forward to witnessing our patients progress and benefit from our new facility and equipment. One small step in rehab is a giant leap in recovery.”

 Rehabilitation hits close to home for Jon, the former Chairman and CEO of IDEXX Laboratories, a global leader in pet healthcare innovation. In June 2019, his life was forever changed when he was seriously injured in a catastrophic bike crash, caused by another cyclist, leaving him a quadriplegic.

 “My spinal cord injury six years ago has given me a great appreciation for physical and occupational therapy. Even in this phase of my injury, I continue to advance function, strength and wellbeing by spending roughly 20 hours a week dedicated to therapy,” said Jon, a Fort Lauderdale resident and member of the Holy Cross Health Board of Directors. “I am so appreciative of the professional support, received from over 25 different therapists in multiple locations in the past six years.”

 “Helaine and I, through this amazing Center and staff, wish to inspire and enable other patients by providing access to great therapists, supported by the latest technology and treatments,” Jon continued. “Many patients, with the proper support, patience and perseverance, will return from a setback to full physical function and health. Others will benefit in enduring their condition through a continued commitment to professional physical therapy.”

 Rudy Molinet, RN, MPH, FACHE, Chair of the Holy Cross Health Board of Directors, added, “We’re grateful for Jon’s leadership and service as a board member. He and Helaine helped build something truly meaningful for our community. We are so blessed to have them as a member of the Holy Cross family.”

 The rehabilitation team was also on hand during the reception to give attendees a tour of the facility and demonstrate how the innovative equipment works.

 Holy Cross has added:

 The Balance Quest TRV Chair diagnoses and treats patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). When the patient is strapped securely into the chair, the seat can be rotated 360 degrees along a semicircular plane to put the patient in an inverted position. The patient wears video-enabled goggles so their eye movements can be monitored. According to manufacturer Interacoustics, vertigo accounts for approximately six million clinic visits in the U.S. annually. Nearly 50% of these patients experiencing dizziness are diagnosed with BPPV, and nearly 10% of the population will have an occurrence in their lifetime and the likelihood increases by 38% every 10 years, with the highest number of cases in people between 50 and 70 years of age.

 The C-Mill balance and gait treadmill incorporates virtual and augmented reality on a large screen to simulate walking in various challenging settings that a person is likely to encounter when out and about. There are adjustable handrails and an optional harness to provide patients with stability as they stroll. The immersive and interactive experience adds a bit of fun to rehab.

 The Biodex Balance System SD is a platform that a patient stands on while holding on to handles for stability. The platform moves, challenging the patient to balance and build muscle in their legs and core. Athletes also use this for agility training. It assesses fall risk and is used in concussion management.

 The MyoCycle Pro is a functional electrical stimulation (FES) stationary bicycle used to help patients suffering from spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis (MS), strokes, brain injuries or other neurological disorders. Patients strap their feet and calves into boots attached to the pedals. The motorized pedals go in a circular motion to simulate riding a bike, giving patients the ability to exercise and build and maintain muscle tone even if they are not physically capable of initiating the pedaling. Small adhesive electrodes that emit electric impulses are placed on the arms or legs to activate the limbs. For patients who are in a wheelchair, they can remain seated in their wheelchair while using this bike.

 The EksoNR is a robotic exoskeleton designed to retrain the body how to walk, with the goal of patients one day regaining the ability to walk without assistance. The exoskeleton has leg braces and a vest that is strapped onto a patient’s body to help the appendages move. It’s the first exoskeleton that’s FDA-cleared to rehabilitate people with brain injuries, strokes, MS and spinal cord injuries.

 RT300 UE/ LE FES cycle, designed for a wide range of neurological impairments, provides real-time biofeedback, data-tracking and sophisticated control algorithms.

 Guldmann gait and balance system is a walking sling for users who have sufficient leg strength to stand upright but need support and to feel safe during training due to reduced balance. The Gait Trainer sling provides the needed support during walking and gait training and helps the user maintain standing.

 Strolll® is a revolutionary all-in-one digital therapeutic software solution for commercially available augmented reality (AR) glasses. A form of immersive rehabilitation, it seamlessly blends digital content with your physical space and adapts to any room layout, aiding patient rehabilitation.
