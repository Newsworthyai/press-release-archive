# Q&amp;A with Saad Alam, Founder of Hone Health

[Saad Alam](https://www.instagram.com/msaadalam/?hl=en) is the Co-Founder and CEO of [Hone Health](https://honehealth.com/), one of the largest longevity care platforms for men and women. A serial entrepreneur and vocal advocate for modernizing the longevity space and the way our society defines healthcare, Saad Alam launched Hone Health in 2020 after confronting his own health challenges in his 30s and seeing his father prematurely pass away from preventable, chronic illness. Frustrated by the lack of accessible, proactive care for aging men and women, Alam set out to build an affordable solution that empowers people to increase their healthspan by reducing their biological age and overall health through science-backed diagnostics and ongoing medical support. Prior to Hone, Alam co-founded Citelighter, an education technology company that was acquired by Sylvan Learning. He has been featured in The New York Times, Forbes, TechCrunch, and GQ, and is a trusted voice in conversations around aging, masculinity, and healthcare innovation. Alam was also the esteemed Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year finalist in 2024. Alam is also primed to launch his new video series which takes followers and clients behind the scenes of his day-to-day, as a husband, founder, advocate, and more. The 15-part series is set to launch this summer on YouTube, Instagram, and LinkedIn.

You’ve been called “The Longevity CEO” — what does that title mean to you, and how does it reflect the mission behind Hone Health? To me, longevity isn’t about chasing immortality, it’s about building infrastructure that helps people extend the number of years they live with full energy, focus, and physical capacity. At Hone Health, we’re redefining what primary care should be: proactive, continuous, and designed to optimize your biology before things break down. The title reflects our mission to help millions take control of their healthspan (not just their lifespan) using real diagnostics, physician-guided care, and emerging AI tools that make advanced health accessible to the mainstream.

 Hone Health takes a diagnostic-first approach to aging. Why do you believe this model is the future of preventative care — especially for men and women?

 You can’t optimize what you don’t measure. Traditional care waits until something goes wrong. Our model flips that by identifying subtle changes in 40 to 100+ biomarkers that often go overlooked, from hormones and inflammation to metabolic function. That kind of data gives us an early-warning system for aging-related decline. With the costs of cutting-edge diagnostics falling and open lab APIs making everything faster and more scalable, a diagnostic-first approach is no longer inaccessible. It’s the foundation of accessible, preventative care for both men and women.

 You’ve spoken openly about your own health journey. How did your personal experience inspire the creation of Hone?

 In my late 30s, I felt off to put it lightly. I had less energy, less focus, and more anxiety. I went to dozens of doctors and got a mix of vague advice and limited results.

 Eventually, I discovered my testosterone had significantly dropped. That realization changed everything. I saw how many other men were silently suffering, misdiagnosed, or dismissed entirely while those properly diagnosed dealt with stigma. I also saw how fragmented the system was: one clinic for bloodwork, another for treatment, and no one looking at the full picture. That’s when I knew there had to be a better way: a platform that combined diagnostics, clinical expertise, and personalized care into one seamless experience.

 That was just how Hone got its start and how we were able to immediately provide value and gain market share. From the inception though, I always knew we had the potential to replicate this model with other health modalities and truly find product-market fit. Now Hone helps hundreds of thousands of men and women across the country with various health issues as well as longevity care from hormonal abnormalities to hair loss to obesity to the various symptoms of menopause.

 However, I am most excited about where we are going next, disrupting the intersection of the longevity, wellness, and primary care industries.

 What do you see as the biggest flaw in today’s healthcare system when it comes to aging and longevity — and how is Hone challenging that status quo?

 The biggest flaw is that we’ve built an entire system around treating disease after it shows up, rather than optimizing health to prevent it. That delay costs us decades of quality living. Furthermore, physicians and practitioners are often so deeply specialized and siloed that coordinated, holistic care becomes difficult to achieve. This ultimately fragments the patient experience and leads to unnecessary confusion. At Hone, we’re challenging that by shifting care upstream. Instead of treating symptoms reactively, we’re using biomarkers, AI, and real-time data to intercept decline before it happens — and we’re doing it in a way that’s scalable, affordable, and accessible from home.

 From hormones to cardiovascular risk, Hone’s at-home diagnostics span across critical aging biomarkers. What data do you think every man over 30 should be tracking — and why?

 Every man over 30 should be tracking testosterone, estradiol, SHBG, insulin sensitivity, ApoB, inflammation markers, and sleep quality…at a minimum. These aren’t just numbers; they’re signals that tell you whether your body is aging well or on a crash course. Low testosterone, poor metabolic function, and silent inflammation don’t always show up as symptoms, until they do, and by then it’s often late. You don’t need to be sick to start paying attention to your biology.

 Telehealth is often viewed as transactional. How is Hone using technology to create more personalized, continuous care for its members?

 Most telehealth is one-and-done. Hone is building the opposite: a long-term relationship between patient, physician, and data. We’re using AI to synthesize lab trends over time, flag risks before symptoms arise, and personalize protocols based on how your biomarkers respond to treatment. Members can retest, refine, and adjust continuously, all guided by a physician who knows their full story. It’s not a one-off visit. It’s a feedback loop that gets smarter every time you use it.

 Where do you see the longevity movement heading in the next 5–10 years — and how is Hone positioning itself at the forefront of that evolution?

 In the next decade, I believe Healthspan Medicine will replace primary care as we know it. The old system consisting of long waits, generic advice,and no data is collapsing. The new system will be continuous, AI-powered health optimization leveraging new biomarkers and data uncovered from the rapidly declining costs of cutting-edge diagnostic and testing technologies. People will run real-time health experiments on themselves, course-correct instantly, and extend high performance into their 70s and beyond. It will turn every person into their own Chief Health Officer and take control of their healthspan.

 Hone is building this operating system and infrastructure for the future. We’re creating a scalable model for preventive, AI-augmented, physician-led care that serves the mainstream public. Even now, our average members are 45-year-old dads in Ohio earning $70k a year, not tech billionaires. This democratization will only increase over the next 5-10 years. That accessibility, paired with medical rigor and technologically enabled convenience, is what sets us apart. We’re collapsing the silos between diagnostics, treatment, and coaching into one integrated system…one that gets smarter the more you use it.

 Can you tell us about the video series you plan to launch in the coming weeks, taking viewers through a day in your life as a CEO and founder?

 Yes. We’re launching a video series that documents my own health optimization journey as a founder, father, and husband. It’s part behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to build a company like Hone and part blueprint for anyone trying to live and lead at their highest capacity. I’ll be working with top physicians, running experiments, using diagnostics and wearables to fix my lingering health issues. I will also share how I integrate recovery, mindset, and performance into a nonstop lifestyle.

 We’ll also feature my family prominently, specifically my wife, my mom, and my brother, showing how we’re optimizing their health too. It’s about proving this model works in the real world, not just in theory.
