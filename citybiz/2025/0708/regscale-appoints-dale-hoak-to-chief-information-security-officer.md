# RegScale Appoints Dale Hoak to Chief Information Security Officer

RegScale, the leading provider of Continuous Controls Monitoring (CCM), today announced the promotion of Dale Hoak to Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). A U.S. Navy veteran and accomplished cybersecurity leader, Hoak joined RegScale as its first security hire and one of the first employees. Since then, he has been instrumental in building the company’s security foundation and guiding it through a period of rapid growth, leading to the successful attainment of our FedRAMP High authorization.

 “Promoting Dale to CISO is both a recognition of his incredible impact at RegScale and a celebration of a distinguished career in cybersecurity,” said Travis Howerton, Co-Founder and CEO of RegScale. “The CISO role is often seen as a lifetime achievement award in this field, and Dale has earned it. With decades of experience in the Department of Defense and the private sector, he has brought deep expertise, a relentless drive, and a clear vision to our security program. Over the past year, Dale has led our team through major milestones, including our FedRAMP High authorization, an achievement that’s virtually unheard of for a company at our stage. He has also become a powerful advocate for Continuous Controls Monitoring within the CISO community. We’re lucky to have him on our team, and I couldn’t be more excited to see him step into this well-deserved role.

 Hoak was recruited to RegScale to pioneer the development and maturation of a comprehensive, business-aligned information security program, supporting the company’s evolution from a pre-Series A startup to a fast-scaling innovator. Under his leadership, RegScale achieved critical certifications including SOC 2 Type 2, FedRAMP High, and CSA STAR, unlocking new market opportunities and solidifying enterprise credibility across commercial and federal sectors. He architected and implemented RegScale’s full end-to-end security framework, built a fully operational 24/7/365 Security Operations Center (SOC), and is an advocate of the company’s CCM platform.

 “I’m thankful for the opportunity to work alongside such a talented and dedicated team and remain committed to representing this incredible group of people and being a champion for RegScale as we continue to grow and lead the industry,” said Hoak.

 Hoak’s career spans decades of service in both public and private sectors, including cybersecurity leadership roles in the Department of Defense, where he managed operations for the largest Network Operations Center. His expertise includes global security transformations, SOC leadership, cloud technologies, AI-enhanced security, and embedding security into the DevSecOps lifecycle.

 As CISO, Hoak will lead all aspects of RegScale’s cybersecurity strategy, risk management, compliance, and resilience efforts, ensuring that security continues to serve as a catalyst for innovation, trust, and business growth.
