# Plexāā Closes $4.5 Million Funding Extension

Plexāā, a MedTech startup behind the award-winning BLOOM⁴³ medical device for breast surgery, has announced the close of a $4.5 million funding extension round. The strategic capital infusion will support the imminent U.S. launch of BLOOM⁴³, while also laying the groundwork for future innovations. The funding also strengthens the company’s position ahead of their planned Series A fundraising round.

 Complication rates in breast surgeries, which can include infection, skin necrosis and the need for additional surgeries, have been recorded as high as 30 percent.1 BLOOM⁴³ is the world’s first fully wearable medical device designed to help patients prepare for breast cancer surgery and reconstruction by harnessing the power of Supraphysiological Preconditioning. The new technique safely and intermittently thermally preconditions the skin causing the release of heat-shock proteins that cause vasodilation and increased blood flow to the area. This process has been shown to reduce wound healing complications in proof-of-concept clinical trials.

 Along with its BLOOM⁴³ companion app, the device has demonstrated substantial improvements in the patient experience and surgical readiness, harnessing the power of holistic Prehabilitation and preconditioning. The company has already secured multiple partners for its upcoming U.S. commercial launch.

 “I want to thank our team for the tremendous progress it has made to make this financing possible,” said Dr. Saahil Mehta, founder and CEO of Plexāā. “Securing this funding validates confidence in our flagship technology and the concept of Supraphysiological Preconditioning, and it energizes the team as we prepare to bring BLOOM⁴³ to a wider patient population in the U.S. and beyond. The funds will support this pivotal launch and market expansion, as well as the exciting development of our technology platform – including devices and apps targeting additional surgical specialties and creating a whole new category in surgery.”

 Plexāā Ltd has been backed by TCP Health Ventures (the dedicated healthcare investment arm of The Capital Partnership group of companies) who led the Seed Round. This extension round comprises existing and new investors including TCP. Further investment includes over $1.6 million in i4i grant funding from the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), and $1.3 million from Thena Capital, a London-based VC firm backed by the British Business Bank and focused on digital health and fast-tracked Medtech.

Tatum Getty, founding General Partner at THENA Capital added, “Since 2023, we’ve been closely tracking Plexāā’s progress and the development of its first device, Bloom⁴³. We couldn’t be more excited for Plexāā to become our first portfolio company for THENA Capital’s Fund I. The company is solving a critical and under-addressed challenge across the surgical pathway- reducing post-operative complications for patients which also addresses the impact to both providers and payers.

 “Saahil and his team bring together clinical, engineering, and operational expertise from some of the UK’s leading institutions. Their bold ambition to scale globally, beginning with an imminent commercial launch in the U.S., is exactly the kind of UK MedTech leadership team we look to champion. Our fund’s commercialisation support model is well-suited to help Plexāā expand into women’s health and adjacent categories where better outcomes and patient experiences are urgently needed.”

 Plexāā plans to collaborate with clinicians, patients, and partners worldwide to make prehabilitation and preconditioning the standard of care for surgery — and to deliver transformative solutions that address unmet needs in surgical care.
