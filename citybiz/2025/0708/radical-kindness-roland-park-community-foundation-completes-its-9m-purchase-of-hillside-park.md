# ‘Radical Kindness’: Roland Park Community Foundation Completes Its $9m Purchase Of ‘Hillside Park’

‘Hillside Park’ is in new hands.

 Members of the Roland Park Community Foundation on Monday completed their long-awaited $9 million purchase of the 20-acre tract they’ve wanted to open to the public as a new civic amenity, Hillside Park.

 The sale marks the culmination of 25 years of planning and fundraising to buy the wooded hillside from the Baltimore Country Club, which is retaining its clubhouse at 4712 Club Lane and about 12 acres at the top of the hill.

 Community leaders say it will result in the creation of the first new park of its size in Baltimore since Patterson Park was created in 1860. A “ribbon-cutting and celebration” event is scheduled for Friday, Oct. 10.

 The sloping property, once part of a golf course, stretches along Falls Road across from Poly and Western high schools. One difference from other city parks is that the land will be owned and maintained by a private non-profit entity so it won’t be a drain on the city’s budget.

 The new owners say the land will be open to the public immediately and be accessible from dawn to dusk, in keeping with city park standards. A website has been launched – www.hillsideparkmd.org — to spread the word and solicit support.
