# Honeycomb Insurance Opens New Headquarters in Chicago

Honeycomb Insurance, one of the fastest-growing insurtech companies in the U.S., today announced the opening of its new 15,000-square-foot headquarters in Chicago. The move follows a year of record growth for the company, which uses AI and proprietary computer vision to modernize property insurance for residential real estate.

 Backed by significant funding from Zeev Ventures (the early investor in Navan and Next Insurance), Honeycomb has become a go-to solution for landlords, condo associations, and multifamily property owners. Its platform powers real-time, accurate risk underwriting while supporting rather than replacing brokers, and operates across 18 states. To date, the company has insured over $55 billion in assets and more than doubled its revenue year over year.

 The new office includes 10 private offices and 10 conference, huddle, and call rooms, with the capacity to double the company’s local presence. Honeycomb plans to hire approximately 50 new employees company-wide in the coming year to support continued expansion.

 Honeycomb is proud to call the Chicago Board of Trade our new home base,” said Itai Ben-Zaken, CEO and co-founder of Honeycomb. “The city’s incredible talent pool makes it the perfect place to build the future of real estate insurance.”
