Emergn, a global leader dedicated to improving the way people and companies work forever, today announced the appointment of Jaime Ruhl as its Chief Revenue Officer (CRO). This strategic move underscores Emergn’s commitment to accelerating its global growth, expanding its transformative solutions into fast-moving emerging markets, and reinforcing its unique Value, Flow, Quality (VFQ) philosophy at the core of customer engagement.

 In a business landscape marked by economic uncertainty, evolving customer expectations, and the accelerating impact of AI, Ruhl’s appointment comes at a pivotal moment. As CRO, she will champion stronger alignment across all go-to-market functions, ensuring Emergn continues to deliver substantial value to organizations shifting from project to product-centric ways of working

 “Appointing a CRO is a significant step in Emergn’s ambition to bring tighter integration to our sales, marketing, and delivery efforts, driving consistent value creation and scaling our promise: to improve the way people and companies work. Forever,” stated Alex Adamopoulos, Chairman and CEO of Emergn. “Jaime’s proven ability to turn vision into action, especially in new and evolving markets, makes her the perfect fit. Her leadership will be instrumental as we expand our global footprint and continue to empower our clients to work smarter, more efficiently, and deliver valuable outcomes by focusing on Value, Flow, and Quality.”

 Ruhl brings over 15 years of experience in scaling revenue and delighting clients, with previous leadership roles at Avanade and Atos. Most recently, as Emergn’s Vice President of Sales, North America, she demonstrated a strong track record of winning large-scale enterprise deals and building high-performing, customer-centric teams. Her leadership philosophy prioritizes mentorship and cross-functional collaboration, ensuring a culture where strategic thinking and commercial acumen thrive.

 “I’m incredibly grateful to step into this role and help drive Emergn’s next chapter of strategic growth globally in both the markets we serve and those that are rapidly emerging for us,” said Ruhl. “There’s a real opportunity to bring our solutions, grounded in the VFQ philosophy, to new markets in a way that makes a lasting impact for customers and teams alike. Emergn’s focus on helping clients understand what truly matters to their customers and the business, then delivering that value in frequent, meaningful increments, is more critical than ever.”

 Ruhl’s strategic vision focuses on accelerating growth in several key industries, where Emergn has over 15 years of deep experience and excellent results, by introducing them to the transformative ways of working that Emergn employs with its clients. Her deliberate and economical approach focuses on building the right foundation and ensuring Emergn grows only where it can truly deliver differentiated value.

The company’s VFQ philosophy, which underpins its consulting, technology, and capability development services like Praxis, helps organizations deliver value early and often, optimize the flow of work, and discover quality with fast feedback. This appointment will further enhance Emergn’s ability to help clients build their own capabilities and own their transformation, rather than fostering dependency on external consultants.
