# Hanover Company Announces Groundbreaking of 2-Building Industrial Project in Baltimore-Washington Corridor

Hanover Company is pleased to announce the groundbreaking of a new industrial complex within the Baltimore-Washington corridor, comprised of two distinct Class A industrial buildings. The development will significantly enhance the industrial warehouse landscape within the underserved Washington D.C. submarket.

 The development site at 765 & 775 Crain Highway North, Gambrills, offers exceptional logistical advantages, proximity to the D.C. metropolitan area via Maryland Route 3 South, and short drive times to Interstate 95 and to the Port of Baltimore, BWI Airport and the Baltimore metropolitan area via Interstate 97.

 “We are proud to break ground on this next-generation logistics facility in the Baltimore-Washington corridor, a region that offers easy access to the Port of Baltimore and BWI Airport and unparalleled connectivity to the Baltimore and Washington metropolitan areas,” said Dan Gordon, Regional Development Partner at Hanover. “Recognizing the undersupply of modern warehouse product in the D.C. market, we are eager to establish a strong presence and contribute to the growth of the region’s industrial infrastructure.”

 Hanover tapped MGMA as the architect on the project. Construction of the MD RTE 3 is projected to be complete July 2026. Doyle Construction will act as the General Contractor on the project and Cushman & Wakefield will be the exclusive marketing agent for the project and will be responsible for securing prospective tenants.

 “This was a complex transaction that required great flexibility and adroit decision making by the Hanover regional team,” said David Hudson, President of Hanover’s Industrial Platform. “We are very pleased with the performance of the regional team and the progress we have made nationally in less-than-ideal overall market conditions. Hanover is looking forward to several other industrial ground-breaking announcements in 2025.”
