# North Providence Welcomes New Sustainable Resale Shop for Teens

Plato’s Closet®, the leading teen and young adult retail resale concept, recently opened its location in North Providence, located at 1401 Douglas Ave. The brand is known for providing local teens and young adults with a place that not only puts cash back into their pockets, but sells gently used brand-name clothing and accessories in a variety of styles and sizes for less.

 With a focus on being a sustainable shopping resource, the new Plato’s Closet in North Providence opened on May 1. Plato’s Closet is part of Winmark – the Resale Company®, a unique national retail resale franchise that focuses on sustainability, small business formation and providing Resale for Everyone®.

 Meet the Local Owner

 Rhode Island native, Stephanie Gardner has always had an entrepreneurial spirit. After a decade of managing retail stores, Gardner transitioned into a corporate marketing position for an international retail brand but always knew that business ownership was in her future. Wanting to return to her Rhode Island roots, Gardner moved back home to bring her entrepreneurial dream to reality.

 Gardner first discovered Plato’s Closet in college and quickly became a loyal customer, selling her outgrown clothes and shopping for active and everyday wear. The brand’s sustainability mission and commitment to giving clothing a second life have stayed with her since. When the opportunity arose to open her own Plato’s Closet, she knew this was the perfect fit for North Providence.

 “While my background in store management and retail marketing has given me a strong foundation, stepping into business ownership has been a whole new challenge,” says Gardner. “What’s made all the difference is the incredible support from the community. North Providence is such a welcoming place for small businesses, and I am truly grateful to be a part of this wonderful community.”

 More About Plato’s Closet North Providence

 Unlike a typical consignment store, no appointment is necessary to sell clothing and accessories to Plato’s Closet. Customers can achieve savings up to 70 percent off trendy, brand-name clothing and accessories and receive cash on the spot for gently used items that are outgrown or no longer wanted.

 Winmark’s resale concepts allow for gently used clothing and accessories to end up in someone else’s closet rather than thrown into a landfill, providing a resource for shoppers who are looking to update their closet in a mindful environmental manner.
