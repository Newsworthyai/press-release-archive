# TAMKO’s StormFighter FLEX Shingles Are Helping Texans Rebuild Stronger

When fierce storms swept across North Texas in early June, bringing wind gusts over 70 mph and heavy rain and hail, the damage to homes and roofs was widespread. In areas like Dallas-Fort Worth, residents are still assessing the destruction left behind by what has been classified as a particularly aggressive round of summer weather.

 As insurance adjusters fan out and contractors prepare for months of repairs, one roofing solution is standing out as a resilient answer to a recurring problem: TAMKO® StormFighter FLEX® shingles.

 Rebuilding for Resilience

 Severe weather is nothing new for Texas homeowners. But the intensity of the June storm was yet another reminder that traditional roofing materials don’t always cut it. Many homeowners are now looking for solutions that not only repair the damage but also provide better long-term protection.

 Enter TAMKO’s StormFighter FLEX shingles, a high-performance asphalt roofing shingle engineered explicitly for extreme weather conditions. Manufactured with TAMKO’s proprietary ForceFX® technology, these shingles are made from a proprietary blend of polymer-modified asphalt, which enhances flexibility, impact resistance, and overall durability.

 This flexibility isn’t just about durability; it’s about giving homeowners peace of mind when the skies turn dark again.

 Tested and Texas-Tough

 Voted the 2025 product of the year,* TAMKO’s StormFighter FLEX shingles are not just a name; they are backed by industry certifications. These shingles are Class 4 impact-rated,** the highest rating offered in the industry. That means they’re specifically tested for resistance to impact damage, like debris carried by high winds during North Texas’s severe storm in early June.

 Built Different with Better Asphalt, Better Polymers, and Better Additives that provide Better Performance, these shingles combine award-winning technology with a reinforced design that holds strong when it matters most. They also feature a high wind warranty of up to 160 mph,† which is a reassuring specification given the rising frequency of high wind gusts in the region.

 Built with Homeowners in Mind

 TAMKO’s StormFighter FLEX shingles come in a variety of bold, dimensional colors designed to enhance curb appeal while delivering elite-level protection. Homeowners don’t have to choose between beauty and performance; they can have both.

 More importantly, TAMKO’s StormFighter FLEX shingles are designed for easier installation, which means faster roofing jobs and quicker recovery timelines for families needing to return to normal life.

 Looking Ahead

 This past storm in June won’t be the last to test Texas homes. As climate patterns shift and harsh weather events become more frequent, roofing solutions must evolve to meet these challenges.

 TAMKO’s commitment to innovation and homeowner protection is embodied in products like StormFighter FLEX shingles. For Texas families navigating the emotional and financial burden of storm recovery, these shingles offer more than a patch – they offer protection.
