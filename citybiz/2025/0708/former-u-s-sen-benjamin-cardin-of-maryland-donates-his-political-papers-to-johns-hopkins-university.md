# Former U. S. Sen. Benjamin Cardin of Maryland Donates His Political Papers To Johns Hopkins University

Former U. S. Senator Benjamin Cardin of Maryland has donated his political papers to Johns Hopkins University’s Sheridan Libraries and University Museums.

 According to The Hub, the university’s news source, the materials span nearly 60 years of Cardin’s career as a legislator. He became Maryland’s senior U. S. senator on Jan. 3, 2017, when Barbara Mikulski retired. He retired on Jan. 3, 2025, and was succeeded by Angela Alsobrooks, the first African American and second woman to represent Maryland in the Senate.

 Cardin’s donation was celebrated last month during a luncheon at Evergreen Carriage House.

 “I thank the Sheridan Libraries and University Museums for their efforts to ensure the tools to learn about our history are widely accessible,” Cardin, 81, said during the luncheon, according to The Hub. “It is so important that everyone — young people especially — understand history and learn the importance of civic engagement. Johns Hopkins is making this possible.”

 The Cardin collection includes 255 boxes of physical material and 2.8 terabytes of digital material – about 2.8 trillion bytes — spanning his time in the Maryland House of Delegates, his years in the U.S. House of Representatives and his three terms as a U.S. senator. The majority of the collection pertains to his Senate career from 2007 to 2024.

 While in the Senate, Cardin was a strong advocate for health care and retirement savings, environmental protection, foreign relations, civil and human rights, small businesses and the federal workforce. According to The Hub, topics mentioned in his collection include the impeachment of Judge Walter Nixon; the U.S. House of Representatives’ ethics investigation of Newt Gingrich; the U.S. Helsinki Commission; the Magnitsky Act; President Donald Trump’s impeachment trials; and the COVID-19 pandemic.
