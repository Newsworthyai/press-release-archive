# The Messi Experience Officially Launches in Chicago

CHICAGO, July 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — The Messi Experience World Tour has officially landed in Chicago, marking the start of its highly anticipated U.S. run. The immersive exhibition opens to the public on Friday, July 4, inviting fans to explore Messi’s journey through October 2025 in Logan Square.

 Produced by Ryve & Aone Agency & PRIMO Entertainment, the Chicago stop offers an immersive tribute to Messi’s impact on the game, brought to life through interactive technology, visual design, and interactive features.

 “This project has always been about more than soccer. It’s about creativity, dedication, and the power of connection,” said Sebastian Diericx de ten Hamme, Leading Partner at Ryve & Aone Agency and a lead voice behind The Messi Experience. “To open this U.S. tour in Chicago with the support of its rich artistic culture, and to see the energy from fans here, is incredibly rewarding.”

 The Messi Experience Chicago expansion and launch was made possible through the support of key champions and community collaborators, including PACO Collective and Chicago Fire, who were instrumental in bringing this experience to life.

 The exhibition includes a specially commissioned Messi Mural by pioneering Chicago graffiti artist Miguel Aguilar (aka Kane One), created exclusively for the Chicago stop. Designed as both a tribute to Messi’s personal path and a reflection of the city’s street art tradition, the mural is part of a broader commitment to supporting Chicago’s creative community and celebrating local voices through public art.

 “Messi’s story is one of resilience and impact, and that’s something I see in the communities I paint for,” said Miguel Aguilar. “Bringing that to life through graffiti in this space feels like a full-circle moment.”

 Tickets are on sale now at www.themessiexperience.com/chicago. Limited-edition merchandise is available for purchase onsite and online, with all proceeds from mural-themed items directly benefiting the Graffiti Institute, supporting local youth through street art education.

 The experience is open daily from 9 AM to 9 PM, with the last tour beginning at 9 PM and doors closing at 10:30 PM. We encourage visitors to check the website for the latest hours and availability. The exhibition is located at 2367 W. Logan Blvd.
