# ADISA Names Jade Miller as Its First CEO

ADISA, the nation’s largest trade association for the alternative investments industry, announced today that industry leader Jade Miller has been appointed chief executive officer. The newly created role reflects ADISA’s evolving leadership structure and future-forward vision, building on the recent appointment of John Grady as executive director.

 “I’m honored to step into this role and help shape the future of such a vital organization,” said Miller. “ADISA has long been a trusted resource in the alternatives industry and I’m excited to work alongside our leadership team to amplify our impact, deliver even greater value to our members and raise the profile of alternatives in today’s evolving investment landscape.”

 Miller’s appointment marks a key milestone in ADISA’s broader strategic realignment. As CEO, she will focus on driving innovation, expanding market influence, strengthening member engagement, and modernizing the organization’s infrastructure and communications. Grady, appointed executive director in June, will continue to lead legal, financial, and regulatory efforts. Together, Miller and Grady will operate in close collaboration, working in tandem, with each focused on their areas of expertise.

 “Jade brings a fresh, dynamic leadership style and a clear vision for the future of both ADISA and the broader alternatives industry,” said Grady. “I look forward to collaborating with her and the ADISA board to continue to advance our mission of education, advocacy, and best-in-class networking events.”

 Prior to joining ADISA as CEO, she served as the youngest president of ADISA’s board of directors, chaired multiple conferences and led the association’s diversity, equity, and inclusion committee. She was a driving force behind the successful unification of TNDDA and ADISA. Previously, she was president of capital markets at Bourne Financial Group, a leading real estate investment firm managing more than $1 billion in assets. She was also recognized as one of GlobeSt.’s Women of Influence last year.

 “This is an exciting new chapter in ADISA’s history,” said Matt Iak, president of ADISA’s board. “Jade understands today’s alternatives landscape, the needs of our members, and how to drive strategic change while preserving the culture that sets ADISA apart. She is the right leader at the right time.”
