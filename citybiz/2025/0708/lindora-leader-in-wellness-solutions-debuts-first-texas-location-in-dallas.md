# Lindora, Leader in Wellness Solutions, Debuts First Texas Location in Dallas

Lindora, a leading provider of medically guided weight loss and metabolic health solutions, opened its first Texas location in Preston Forest on Saturday, May 31. This milestone marks the brand’s entry into the Texas market, with a second location underway in Addison set to open later this summer.

 Located at 6060 Forest Ln., Suite 890, Dallas, TX, Lindora Preston Forest operates Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Saturdays from 8 a.m. – 12 p.m. The new studio meets the local community’s rising demand for holistic wellness offerings, including weight loss services, nutritional guidance, wellness shots, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), GLP-1s and more, designed to support individuals on their path to better health and long-term vitality.

 As part of its opening weekend, Lindora Preston Forest welcomed the community for a special preview of its whole-person wellness philosophy. Attendees participated in consultations, body composition analyses (BCA), bloodwork scheduling and product sampling and explored personalized service options. A 25% lifetime membership discount is available through June 21 or until the first 150 memberships are sold.

 The studio will also host a grand opening celebration on Saturday, June 21, featuring complimentary B12 shots, wellness demonstrations, studio tours and additional wellness-focused experiences.

 “Opening our first Texas location in Dallas is a significant milestone for Lindora,” said Martin Balcaitis, president of Lindora. “As more individuals seek personalized, medically guided solutions for their health and wellness, we’re proud to bring our proven, science-backed approach to a community that values long-term results. This marks the beginning of our broader expansion into Texas and the continued evolution of the Lindora brand.”

 The new studio is being opened by Co-Owners Beth Hanschen and Shweta Chadha, two local entrepreneurs with a passion for wellness and a desire to bring a more personalized, medically guided approach to health to their community. Inspired by Lindora’s track record and values, Hanschen and Chadha saw a meaningful opportunity to expand the brand’s presence to Dallas and create a space where individuals can feel supported, empowered and seen on their wellness journeys.

 “We’re beyond excited to bring Lindora’s wellness approach to Texas for the very first time,” said Hanschen. “This isn’t just about weight loss—it’s about helping people feel better, live healthier and feel truly supported every step of the way. Dallas is such a vibrant, health-minded community, and we can’t wait to welcome our neighbors in and be part of their personal wellness stories.”
