This year, MoMath brings new features from its traveling exhibition, Math Midway 2 Go, and an outpost of Additions, the shop at MoMath, for unique summer gift finds.

 “We are pleased to host the Ninth Annual NYC Math Festival on Fosun Plaza, which has become a destination for arts, culture and community in Lower Manhattan,” said Wei Bo, Fosun Global Partner and Chairman of Four Trees Capital Management. “Fosun has consistently showcased innovative events at 28 Liberty, and we’re proud to support MoMath as it provides inspiring programming for the local community.”

 “The New York City Math Festival provides a dynamic event for families and math lovers, providing a hands-on experience that highlights the power of mathematics while showcasing MoMath’s creative programming,” said Tom Costanzo, Fosun Global Partner and CEO of Four Trees Capital Management. “We are proud that Fosun Plaza has become the home to this powerful event.”

 The 2025 New York City Math Festival will also feature:

 * MoMath’s iconic 120-foot-long Number Line Tightrope
* A variety of interactive exhibits from MoMath’s Math Midway 2 Go, including laser-based shape slicing, tessellation puzzles, and a roller coaster design station

* Math-themed juggling demonstrations by educator and performer John Chase
* Hands-on robotics activities with Robofun, including LEGO builds and programmable robots
* Family-friendly activities from partners like NYU’s Lab for the Developing Mind, MathHappens, and the Russian School of Mathematics

 From origami and group constructions to logic games and math-inspired art, the festival promises something for all ages.

 Guests can also enter a raffle for a chance to win a free MoMath Family Membership, which includes general admission, member discounts, and access to exclusive events and programming. Drawings will be held twice during the day; winners must be present to claim their prize.

 About the National Museum of Mathematics

 The National Museum of Mathematics (MoMath) is North America’s premier cultural institution devoted to the wonders of mathematics and its many connections to the world around us. Transformed temporarily into a pop-up museum called MoMath on Fifth, located at 225 Fifth Avenue on the corner of 26th Street and Fifth Avenue, the Museum is open seven days a week, from 10 am to 5 pm. MoMath is expected to open at its new permanent location in 2025.

 During its physical transition, MoMath continues its robust online programming. MoMath on Fifth contains new exhibits as well as popular favorites, like Beaver Run and the Square Wheel Trike, and welcomes residents, members, families, school groups, and visitors from around the country and world. In-person programming, including talks, birthday parties, events, and field trips, are also offered at MoMath on Fifth.

 Since opening in December 2012, MoMath has greeted over 1.2 million visitors, including more than 300,000 students. When mandated by New York City to close in March 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, MoMath transformed itself into a virtual Museum creating an extraordinary global footprint. Since that time, MoMath has provided nearly 5,500 online programs reaching more than 150,000 participants from all 50 U.S. States and 126 countries.
