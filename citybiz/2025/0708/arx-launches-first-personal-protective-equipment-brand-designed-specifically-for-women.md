# ARX Launches First Personal Protective Equipment Brand Designed Specifically for Women

Women-Owned Company Sets New Standard for Fit, Function, and Comfort in Jobsite Safety Gear

 ARX, a women-owned personal protective equipment (PPE) brand, announced today the launch of its debut product line designed for women. Built for comfort, function, and fit, ARX aims to redefine safety standards in industries where women have long been underserved by PPE originally designed for men.

 Founded by Dr. Hilary Gallin, a physician with a background in anesthesiology and surgical care, and Kaitlin McCarthy, founder and CEO of Ionic Development, one of the few women- owned commercial real estate firms in Greater Boston, ARX draws from the co-founders’ personal experiences in male-dominated fields that rely heavily on PPE.

 “We were tired of wearing PPE that didn’t fit and wasn’t made for us,” said McCarthy. “ARX was born from the need to feel safe, respected, and confident at work.”

 “When women wear gear designed specifically for them, it changes how they work and how they’re seen,” said Dr. Gallin. “This isn’t just about clothing. It’s about culture, confidence, and equality on jobsites and beyond.”

 Developed to meet the real-world demands of women in the construction field, ARX’s launch collection addresses long-overlooked gaps in traditional PPE and sets a new standard for what jobsite safety should look like. ARX’s launch collection includes the Original Vest and Original Shirt, featuring the company’s proprietary Multipoint Fit System—a design innovation that provides a tailored silhouette, breathable fabric, and unrestricted mobility without compromising on protection or durability.

 The launch is especially timely given updated OSHA regulations regarding PPE fit. The updated rule explicitly requires the equipment to properly fit any construction worker who needs it. ARX’s vest is ANSI-107 Type R Class 2 Certified to meet OSHA regulations.

 Trusted by leading companies such as Tocci Building Companies, NorthBridge Partners, AMCON Construction, and Build Health International, ARX is already helping employers better support their workforce with high-performance PPE that fits the individual wearer.

 While ARX’s first release is tailored for the construction industry, future collections will expand to serve women in additional sectors requiring reliable, fitted safety gear.

 The ARX PPE line is available now at www.shoparxppe.com, with new styles and industryspecific gear expected later this year.
