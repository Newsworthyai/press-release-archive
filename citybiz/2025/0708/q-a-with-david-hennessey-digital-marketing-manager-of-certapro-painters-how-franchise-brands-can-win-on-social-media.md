 What are the biggest mistakes franchise brands make on social media, and how can they avoid them?

 Two major mistakes come to mind: 1) using social media exclusively for sales, and 2) failing to engage with users or other brands. While social media can help improve lower-funnel metrics, it should also be used to generate brand awareness, engagement, and impressions among your target audiences. Users do not want to be constantly sold to.

 Additionally, many brands get caught up in day-to-day activities and forget to be “social” on social media. It is essential to have a solid plan for engaging with customers who reach out through comments or direct messages and to actively share content and interact with others.

 Another common pitfall is ignoring the local aspect of their businesses or presenting inconsistent branding. Professionalism matters more than striving for perfection, as customers seek authentic experiences with genuine brands on social media. Furthermore, many franchisees believe they need to hire a professional camera crew or a social media influencer to produce their content, but that is not always necessary. Simple, relatable content often resonates more with audiences.

 Can you share a specific example or success story where social media significantly impacted your brand’s growth or customer engagement?

 One standout example was the work that we did with influencers last year, aimed at increasing brand awareness among a younger audience. We partnered with creators who were able to showcase our services in an authentic and relatable way, and the results delivered strong engagement and a meaningful increase to our follower base.

 Which emerging social media trends or tools should franchise brands pay attention to in the coming year?

 Social media management tools, such as Rallio, are crucial for effectively managing social media at scale within franchise organizations. Establishing an efficient process that allows franchisees to consistently share content while maintaining brand integrity is essential. Local branding is becoming increasingly important, so it’s vital to educate your franchisees and their staff about the significance of capturing and sharing local content in their respective markets. This type of content resonates with consumers on a deeper level compared to generic corporate messaging
