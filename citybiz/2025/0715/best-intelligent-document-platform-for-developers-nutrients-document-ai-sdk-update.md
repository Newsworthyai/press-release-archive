# Best Intelligent Document Platform for Developers, Nutrient’s Document AI SDK Update

Nutrient, the document AI company for modern enterprises, today announced the release of its Q2 2025 SDK update, introducing a powerful suite of AI-native features designed to accelerate the way developers build, test, and scale document-centric workflows in an AI-driven world. With intelligent redaction, contextual text comparison, multi-document AI assistance, and open source tools for orchestrating agentic workflows through contextual engineering, this release solidifies Nutrient’s role as the foundational developer suite of tools for building intelligent document processing and viewing applications.

 “We’re not just wrapping AI and calling it innovation — we’re building intelligence into the core of every document experience,” said Jonathan Rhyne, co-founder and CEO at Nutrient. “Our Document AI platform enables developers to create secure, efficient, and truly intelligent document workflows their users can trust and rely on.”

 AI that’s embedded, not bolted on

 The Q2 SDK release brings a series of purpose-built AI enhancements to Nutrient’s web, mobile, and server SDKs:

 * AI-powered redaction combines the strength of LLMs with the accuracy of traditional approaches to achieve complete document understanding that identifies content accurately and efficiently and irreversibly removes it — protecting data privacy and ensuring compliance at scale.
* AI text comparison categorizes, summarizes, and highlights large amounts of semantic changes between document versions, filtering out noise and allowing the reviewer to focus on meaningful changes.
* AI Assistant expands to MAUI, Flutter, React Native, and .NET for Android, enabling natural language document interaction and querying across mobile and desktop — including multi-document context and summarization on iOS.

 Open source agentic orchestration

 With the launch of DWS MCP Server, Nutrient enables developers to build and orchestrate agentic workflows through natural language prompts. The MCP Server connects LLM-powered agents and tools to accomplish document tasks — from redacting PII and merging PDFs, to converting documents and more — using simple, natural language prompting. Its ease of integration into GPTs, chatbots, and other agentic tools like Claude Desktop and Claude Code — along with built-in support to build custom agents through an open, extensible protocol — enables developers to build semi- and fully autonomous agentic document workflows with industry-leading document processing.

 Additional release highlights include:

 * An entirely rebuilt Java SDK, fully aligned with Nutrient’s modern engine and .NET stack, delivering a fresh, idiomatic API that’s ready for high-volume, high-fidelity workloads.
* Accessibility upgrades to the Web Viewer SDK (WCAG 2.2 support + automatic PDF/UA tagging via DWS API), enabling legally compliant inclusive applications from day one.
* Dozens of developer-facing improvements across OCR, PDF conversion, and viewer performance, removing friction and saving hours from monthly workflows.

 “Generative AI is changing how people work and build — and we’re making it accessible where it matters most,” said Jonathan Rhyne, co-founder and CEO at Nutrient. “From mobile apps to backend services, Nutrient gives developers full-stack capabilities to build and deliver AI-powered document workflows.”

 This release lays the groundwork for a new era where document experiences are not just digitized, but intelligent by design. For more information about these updates, read the full Q2 release blog, or register for the upcoming product update webinar on 17 July 2025 at 10 a.m. EDT / 4 p.m. CEST.
