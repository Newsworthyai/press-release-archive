# State Roundup: Number Of Homeless Students Rise, But Federal Aid Is Cut; Maryland Mandates Detention For Teens Who Offend While Monitored

AS NUMBER OF HOMELESS STUDENTS RISES, FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID IS CUT: The number of homeless students in Maryland has risen by 24% over six years thanks to soaring rents and improved identification of students facing housing instability, according to Maryland education data and education officials.

 BAY JURISDICTIONS REASSESS CLEANUP PLAN: For Maryland and states across the Chesapeake Bay watershed, the start of 2025 came with familiar disappointment. The group of seven jurisdictions working to clean up the Chesapeake Bay fell short of a much-anticipated deadline to curb pollution and rebuild ecosystems in the nation’s largest estuary. Now, watershed states and federal officials are back to soul searching. By the end of the year, they aim to revamp goals and develop a new Chesapeake Bay cleanup plan, the fifth agreement between bay states since restoration work began in 1983.

 STATE, LOCAL LEADERS SEEK PATH FORWARD AMID FBI HQ UNCERTAINTY: For nearly a decade, there were hopes that a new FBI headquarters would spur a significant expansion in real estate projects and revenue in the Greenbelt area. Now, the location is once again in limbo, launching another round of the waiting game. “When a commitment is made, that has impacts,” said Greenbelt Mayor Emmett Jordan. “The back-and-forth just creates this uncertainty.” Federal, state and county officials are pushing for any path forward for the bureau to land in Greenbelt after the Trump administration changed course.

 THOUSANDS NOTIFIED OF STATE EMPLOYEE BUYOUT PROGRAM: Thousands of state employees were notified by email Thursday of the state’s buyout program, part of a plan by Gov. Wes Moore to reduce the size of state government and cut $121 million from ongoing personnel expenses. Details of the “voluntary separation program” were also posted on the website of the state Department of Budget and Management. Bryan Sears/Maryland Matters.

 COMMENTARY: TRUMP ADMIN THREATENS MARYLAND EDUCATION REFORM: More than $6.2 billion in federal education funds — approved under the FY2025 budget and scheduled for release on July 1 — remains frozen. The Trump administration insists this is part of an “ongoing review,” but to the parents, teachers and students staring down the first day of school without the support they were promised, it looks more like sabotage. The longer these funds remain impounded, the deeper the damage — not just to school budgets, but to the futures of children across the country. And while the crisis is national, the impact in Maryland is particularly acute. Lorraine Johns-De La Garza and Sophie Smith/Maryland Reporter.

 STATE TOURISM GROUPS TO GET $4.66M IN GRANTS: Maryland nonprofits and “heritage tourism organizations” are set to receive $4.66 million in grant funds, Gov. Wes Moore announced Friday. Funding comes through the Maryland Heritage Areas Authority’s Heritage Program, which supports “the development of heritage-related, place-based projects across Maryland that promote economic growth through tourism and community enhancement,” according to a press release.

 LOCUST POINT SEEKS RELIEF FROM NOISY U.S. MILITARY SHIPS: For over a month, residents of Locust Point have been asking local and national authorities when the large, noisy military ships that berthed near their homes would quiet down. Thursday, they got an answer. “As of July 10, we expect both ships to be switched to shore power within the next six (6) months,” wrote Brenna Jefferies, a spokesperson for the U.S. Maritime Administration in an email to residents Thursday evening. “Simultaneously, MARAD teams are exploring potential solutions to help reduce noise levels.” Nina Giraldo/The Baltimore Banner.

 McCLAIN DELANEY SLAMS TRUMP’s ‘BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL:’ U.S. Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-Dist. 6) says that while President Donald Trump’s slogan is “Make America Great Again,” his budget reconciliation legislation passed last week by Congress will “make America break.” “This is the worst piece of legislation I’ve ever seen in my life. Some people called it big and beautiful … but it’s an enormous harm for our country, and it threatens our future,” Delaney, referring to the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill,” said on Thursday. “I think it’s just tragic in a multitude of ways.” Ginny Bixby/Bethesda Today.

 COURT OVERTURNS MOSBY’s MORTGAGE FRAUD CONVICTION: A federal appeals court on Friday overturned former Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby’s mortgage fraud conviction, but rejected her attempt to challenge guilty verdicts for perjury. Dylan Segelbaum/The Baltimore Banner.

 NEW EDGEWOOD PARK TO HONOR U.S. ARMY TRAILBLAZER: Edgewood’s newest community park has been named in honor of Mildred C. Kelly, a trailblazer in the U.S. Army who became the first Black woman to hold the highest enlisted position at a major Army installation. In 1972, while serving at the Pentagon, Kelly first made history when she became the first black female Sergeant Major in the Army. Two years later, she was the first female command sergeant major of an Army installation and the highest-ranking African American enlisted woman in the Army. She retired in 1976.

 ACTIVISTS RALLY AROUND NEIGHBORHOOD HIT BY MASS OVERDOSE: Although authorities are still investigating what caused a mass overdose event in Baltimore’s Penn North neighborhood, activist Donna Bruce and many others in the community believe it was an especially dangerous batch of testers that hospitalized more than two dozen people on Thursday. Community workers who serve people who use drugs immediately began alerting their networks to avoid using testers from the area, they said. Alissa Zhu, Lee O. Sanderlin and Justin Fenton/The Baltimore Banner.

 * Standing early Saturday morning under a bus shelter at Pennsylvania and North avenues, near the epicenter of Thursday’s mass overdose that sent at least 27 people to the hospital, Elijah Bradley said resources have flooded into the community over the last two days. But Bradley said the streets were quieter than usual, and he wondered if the people who most needed the support were receiving it. Sapna Bansil and Jessica Gallagher/The Baltimore Banner.

 DEVELOPER PUSHED FOR CITY POLICE HELIPAD; HE MAY FINALLY GET IT: For years, developer Scott Plank has pitched his heliport on a narrow dock at the elbow of land across from Canton Waterfront Park as a home for the Baltimore Police helicopter unit known as Foxtrot. The state and city pieces for that to happen are now falling into place. Emily Opilo, Justin Fenton and Greg Morton/The Baltimore Banner.

 CITY SCHOOLS SHUT DRINKING FOUNTAINS, BUT REPLACEMENTS HAVE ISSUES: Nearly 20 years ago, Baltimore City schools shut off the majority of its drinking fountains to eliminate the risk of lead poisoning — instead opting to use five-gallon water jugs. That switch has caused a lot of relief, but it also comes with a new set of issues. Bri Hatch/WYPR-FM.

 JUDGE SCOLDS TRUMP ADMIN ON LACK OF INFO ON PLANS FOR GARCIA: A federal judge in Maryland scolded the Trump administration on Friday for its “utter refusal” to detail its deportation plans for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, including where the government plans to send him and whether he’ll get a chance to fight his expulsion before he’s whisked away.
