# Christmas in July: Expat Explore Urges Travelers to Book Now for a Sunny, Affordable, and Culturally Rich Holiday Season

With just five months until the holiday season, Expat Explore, one of the world’s top group tour operators, forecasts that holiday travel will be warmer, longer, and more intentional and international than ever before. Although it’s only July, now is the ideal time to start planning.

 “As we look ahead to the 2025-26 holiday travel season, it’s clear that we are entering a new era of intentional international travel,” said Carl Cronje, co-founder of Expat Explore. “Travelers aren’t just going farther—they’re traveling smarter. We’re observing a strong shift toward longer trips, better value, and destinations that offer summer weather during the usual winter break.”

 What to Expect This Holiday Season

 According to Expat Explore’s Christmas in July forecast, three major shifts will shape the upcoming holiday travel season:

 * Extended Holiday Experiences
* Value-Conscious Planning
* Shoulder Season Surge

 For those looking to trade snow for sun, Expat Explore recommends South Africa Escape Tour, Highlights of Morrocco Tour and the Cape Town and Garden Route Tour.

 “We’re seeing a reimagining of holiday travel,” said Jakes Maritz, co-founder of Expat Explore. “People want more from their holidays: more meaning, more time, and more sunshine. That’s why our tours to South Africa, South America and warm destinations are surging in popularity for our American customers.”

 Give the Gift of Travel

 Travel experiences are becoming one of the most meaningful gifts of the season. Before booking on someone’s behalf, Expat Explore recommends considering:

 * Seasonal Preferences
* Accessibility
* Value
* Cultural Immersion

 “Our gift to travelers is the promise of meaningful exploration without the stress of planning or the shock of hidden costs,” said Maritz. “Whether you want snow-capped castles in Europe or sunshine on safari, there’s something for everyone when you book with Expat Explore.”

 For those looking to get into the holiday spirit, Expat Explore offers 7 to 14 day traditional Christmas tours that span across popular European and United Kingdom destinations including the Europe Taster Christmas Tour, Spain Portugal Christmas Tour and the Europe Jewel Christmas & New Year Tour.
