# Update: 2025’s Changes in Inflation by City – WalletHub Study

With the year-over-year inflation rate at 2.7% in June (the highest since February), the personal-finance company WalletHub today released its updated report on the Changes in Inflation by City, as well as expert commentary.

 To determine how inflation is impacting people in different cities, WalletHub compared 23 major MSAs (Metropolitan Statistical Areas) across two key metrics involving the Consumer Price Index, which measures inflation.
