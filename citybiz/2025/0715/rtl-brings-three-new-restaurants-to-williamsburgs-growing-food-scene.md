# RTL Brings Three New Restaurants to Williamsburg’s Growing Food Scene

Williamsburg continues its evolution into one of New York City’s trendiest food and beverage destinations — this time with a trio of new restaurants secured by RTL, a leading retail brokerage firm.

 Spanning a five-block radius, the deals bring more than 5,000 square feet of curated culinary experiences to the neighborhood.

 Among the highlights is a brand-new concept coming this fall to 62 South 2nd Street from the team behind Nobody Told Me, the acclaimed cocktail bar with locations in both DUMBO and the Upper West Side.

 Just around the corner, Pally, an all-day café and wine bar, opened its doors in June at 223 Kent Avenue. The café serves coffee, tea, and breakfast and lunch during the day, then shifts to a menu of wine, cocktails, and small plates in the evening.

 Both transactions were brokered by RTL’s Executive Vice President and Partner Michael Shkreli and Associate Eli Gold. The landlord at 223 Kent was represented by Tri State Commercial.

 Also new to the neighborhood is Matsunori Sushi Club, a Lower East Side favorite known for its pink sushi rice and BYOB omakase experience, now located at 340 Metropolitan Avenue. Shkreli and Gold represented both the tenant and the landlord in this deal.

 “Williamsburg has seen exceptional growth in recent years, driven by an influx of world-class retailers and now followed by top-quality F&B. These three openings are the latest manifestation of that momentum,” said Shkreli. “Eli and I worked diligently to identify spaces that align with the concepts while still fitting in with the area’s vibrant energy and we know they will become staples in the neighborhood.”

 As more restaurants seek space in walkable, high-traffic NYC neighborhoods, openings like these will continue to define the character and rhythm of Brooklyn and beyond.
