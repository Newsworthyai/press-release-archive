# Kwikset Debuts Sora™ Knob as Latest Addition to Signature Series™

Kwikset®, a trusted leader in residential security and a registered trademark of ASSA ABLOY Americas Residential Inc., an ASSA ABLOY Group Company, is expanding its Signature Series line with the new Sora knob — a timeless, traditionally styled doorknob designed to elevate any space with enduring beauty and trusted performance.

 The Sora knob features a refined silhouette with stepped detailing around the edges, offering a familiar yet sophisticated aesthetic. It’s available in keyed entry, passage, privacy and dummy functions as well as a combo pack — making it ideal for front doors, hallways, bathrooms, bedrooms and closets.

 Available in Matte Black, Satin Nickel and Satin Brass finishes, the Sora collection helps homeowners achieve a cohesive interior style. Select finishes include Microban® antimicrobial protection to keep surfaces 99.9% cleaner than unprotected hardware.

 Sora knobs are built with Kwikset’s patented, precision-built interior to deliver a solid, sturdy feel and wobble-free performance that lasts. The rosette is thoughtfully designed with the same stepped detailing as the knob for a clean, balanced look.

 The keyed entry knob and combo pack feature SmartKey Security®, offering bump- and pick-resistant protection — and easy DIY re-keying in seconds. As the inventors of SmartKey Security, Kwikset delivers advanced yet simple re-key technology trusted by millions.

 All Sora knobs are designed for DIY installation with just a screwdriver. The adjustable latch fits standard door thicknesses from 1-3/8″ to 1-3/4″, and everything needed for setup is included in the box.

 “Sora was crafted to feel familiar, yet refined — bringing a warm, classic look to any door,” said Amanda Archer, group manager of product marketing at Kwikset. “Whether you’re outfitting a whole home or updating a single room, Sora makes it simple to add designer quality and reliable performance.”

 Beginning at $22.99, the Sora knob collection is now available through Kwikset’s network of dealers, distributors, and select retail locations.
