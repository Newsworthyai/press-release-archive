# Presence&amp;Co. Celebrates Grand Opening in Reading, MA, Strengthened by the Support of Boston Business Women Network

Presence&Co. is thrilled to announce the grand opening of its new space in Reading, Massachusetts, marking an exciting milestone in its journey of growth and collaboration. The opening is a testament to the power of professional networking, particularly through the Boston Business Women (BBW) organization, which played a crucial role in connecting key individuals who made this location possible.

 BBW, founded on the mission of empowering, supporting, and connecting female entrepreneurs and professionals, has been instrumental in fostering relationships that drive success. The organization provides members with invaluable resources, including mentorship, business development opportunities, and a vibrant community of like-minded professionals. BBW is the largest networking group in New England for female entrepreneurs. The Facebook community has over 50k women in the primary group, with a dozen subgroups.

Through BBW, members Angela Nuss of Jay Nuss Realty Group, LLC, a commercial real estate firm, and Hannah Corbett, founder of Presence&Co., built a relationship that culminated with Liz Tavares of Jay Nuss Real Estate Group assisting Corbett in securing the ideal space for Presence&Co.

 The success of Presence&Co.’s new location highlights the transformative impact of collaborative networking, where women uplift each other through shared knowledge, referrals, and mutual encouragement. BBW members gain access to exclusive events, industry insights, and a powerful network dedicated to professional and personal growth.

 As Presence&Co. opens its doors in Reading, it extends gratitude to the BBW community and its invaluable connections.
