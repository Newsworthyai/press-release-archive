# HelloPrenup Receives Investment From The LegalTech Fund

Boston-based HelloPrenup, which helps couples craft prenuptial agreements, has received an undisclosed amount in investment from Miami, Fla.-based The LegalTech Fund.

 The startup — founded by Julia Rodgers, who earned a Juris Doctor degree from Suffolk University Law School, and software developer Sarabath Jaffe — has previously won the backing of Shark Tank’s Kevin O’Leary, LegalZoom founder Brian Liu, NextDoor founder Nirav Tolia and Laura A. Wasser, a divorce attorney.

 “Milestone moment over here! HelloPrenup has partnered with The Legal Tech Fund, and I couldn’t be more excited,” Rodgers said in a LinkedIn post. “It feels like the right time to reflect on this wild entrepreneurial journey.”

 Rodgers has been quite a media darling, featuring in several publications including Inc. magazine’s Female Founders 500 list “for expanding the user base of its platform…and growing revenue by 144 percent year over year.”

Both Rodgers, a family law attorney, and Jaffe were driven to starting HelloPrenup by their own experiences. While the lawyer routinely witnessed the struggle and awkwardness of couples seeking prenuptial agreements, Jaffe was frustrated by her own effort to get a prenup. Both then pledged to create an easier way that would also be quicker and cost far less.

 HelloPrenup offers prenups at a flat, one-time fee of $599 per couple, with some additional fees for add-ons, such as online e-signature and notarization. It also offers couples the option to add attorney services. The company says its services have helped protect over $25 billion in assets and has been used by over 100,000 partners.

 The LegalTech Fund is led by founders and managing partners Zach Posner and Sam Elhag. Posner started his career with PricewaterhouseCoopers and went on to work at Insight Venture Partners before co-founding the learning startup Engrade, which was acquired by McGraw-Hill. The fund says it received a boost from the Covid-19 pandemic, as the system rapidly embraced online methods.

 “We are already hearing about a dramatic increase in inquiries about these technologies,” the two, along with Nate Schorr, wrote in a post on Medium, days after Covid-19 began to devastate the world. The LegalTech Fund trio predicted rapid “automation and augmentation through artificial intelligence and data analytics platforms,” and said firms would “double down on technology investments as they see how adding customer value improves loyalty.”

 HelloPrenup plans to use the recent funding to expand its legal coverage across all 50 states and into international markets, and to further develop its technology with AI and other features.
