# Unit 5N Closes at 108 Leonard, Highlighting Continued Demand for Historic Luxury in Tribeca

We’re pleased to announce the closing of Unit 5N at 108 Leonard, an iconic Tribeca condominium where historic Italian Renaissance Revival architecture meets contemporary luxury. One of 10 closings this year, this transaction highlights the strong demand for distinctive, light-filled residences in one of Manhattan’s most sought-after neighborhoods – and at Tribeca’s best-selling conversion. This inimitable home features rare, landmarked details complemented by sophisticated contemporary interiors by award-winning studio Jeffrey Beers International.

 Originally built in 1899 as the New York Life Insurance Company headquarters, 108 Leonard has been meticulously restored to preserve its architectural heritage while introducing modern comforts. 5N is a standout 2,413-square-foot, three-bedroom, 3.5-bath residence with soaring ceilings (a 108 Leonard hallmark), dramatic arched windows, and some of the building’s most impressive original details. The residence’s landmarked interiors—including the restored ornate ceiling and intricate mahogany molding in the living room—make it one of the most remarkable homes in all of Downtown Manhattan. .

 108 Leonard offers residents over 20,000 square feet of private amenities, including a 75-foot lap pool, rooftop gardens, fitness center, and more, further enhancing its appeal.

 Elena Sarkissian, Sales Director with Douglas Elliman Development Marketing, says:

 “With 10 transactions already this year and the building over 90% sold, the pace at which we’re seeing closings at 108 Leonard reflects strong demand for truly unique, historic homes that offer modern luxury. Our buyers recognize the rarity of this opportunity, and that’s driving our continued sales momentum in Tribeca.”

 Elyse Leff, Executive Vice President of Marketing & Sales at Elad Group, adds:

 “The closing of 5N at 108 Leonard is a testament to the continued allure of Tribeca’s most iconic, historic building. Buyers are drawn to the unique blend of landmarked interiors, contemporary design, world-class amenities, and move-in ready residences.”
