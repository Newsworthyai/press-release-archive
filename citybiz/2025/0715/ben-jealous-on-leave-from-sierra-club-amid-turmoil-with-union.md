# Ben Jealous On Leave From Sierra Club Amid Turmoil With Union

Ben Jealous, the former Maryland gubernatorial candidate turned Sierra Club executive director, is “on leave” from his post at the national environmental advocacy group.

 The move comes after significant turmoil during Jealous’ tenure, which began in early 2023.

 The Progressive Workers Union, which represents Sierra Club employees, has slammed Jealous for his management of the organization, citing several rounds of layoffs over the past few years, and other labor disputes. They argue he has placed the nonprofit on unsure footing at a time when President Donald Trump’s (R) administration is loosening environmental regulations and targeting clean-energy projects.

 Jonathon Berman, a spokesperson for the Sierra Club, confirmed Jealous’s leave but declined to comment further, calling it a “personnel matter.” It remains unclear why Jealous is on leave or for how long he will be absent.

 In an email sent to Sierra Club staff Friday, Michael Parrish, the club’s chief operating officer, said that a longtime Sierra Club higher-up, Loren Blackford, would serve as acting executive director in Jealous’ absence.

 Erica Dodt, president of the Progressive Workers Union, cited recent layoffs in a news release Monday.

 “When facing budget challenges, we have been told and believe that Jealous’ executive team increased its size and salaries all while laying off staff critical to Sierra Club’s success,” Dodt said.’
