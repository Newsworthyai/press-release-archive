# Q&amp;A with Jonathan Krieger, Founder of Cure Companies

Jon Krieger is the founder and CEO of Cure Companies, where he incubates and scales mission-driven brands across food, wellness, and real estate. Over the past 20 years, he has built 11+ concepts into 70+ locations nationwide with a combined enterprise value of over $300M, including co-founding Bluestone Lane and expanding it to a national café brand. His latest ventures include Spring House restaurant & social club, Padel United Sports Club, Wandering Que, and the upcoming Blackwood Club.

 Jon, before launching Cure Companies and advising brands across food, real estate, and wellness, what did the early stages of your career look like? What experiences shaped your entrepreneurial approach?

 I was a wild child with a deep hunger for experience. I came up in Manhattan, building retail lifestyle concepts before the phrase “lifestyle brand” had even caught fire. I cut my teeth by creating spaces that made people feel something — energy, identity, aspiration. But it wasn’t until I hit a wall physically, emotionally, and spiritually that I reoriented everything.

 I leaned into healing, fatherhood, and a deeper sense of purpose. What shaped me wasn’t just business success. It was the pain, the personal work, the sacred. I discovered Kabbalah. I sat with medicine in the forest. I started seeing business not as a game of acquisition but as a vehicle for transformation — of neighborhoods, of people, of culture. That philosophy is now the heartbeat of Cure Companies.

 You’ve had a unique ability to identify and scale lifestyle-driven concepts. Cure Companies now oversees ventures ranging from restaurants to private clubs. What ties your portfolio together, and what’s your ultimate vision for the company?

 Everything we build is part of a connected ecosystem centered around healing, vitality, and belonging. We don’t just create restaurants or clubs. We craft micro-universes. Whether it’s Spring House, Padel United, or The Blackwood Club, each concept is a portal into a more elevated way of living.

 At the core is one belief: people crave meaningful, sensory-rich experiences — places that feel like home but also offer something aspirational. Cure Companies is about delivering that feeling across multiple verticals, tied together by design, intentionality, and shared values. The long-term vision is a global hospitality collective rooted in community, driven by innovation, and powered by soul.

 Let’s talk about Spring House, your newest restaurant in Tenafly. What was the inspiration behind it, and how are you hoping it impacts the neighborhood both culinarily and culturally?

 Spring House was born from a simple question: Why should cities have a monopoly on excellence? Tenafly is filled with sophisticated, well-traveled families, but for years their daily culinary options felt limited. We wanted to change that.

 With Spring House, we created a restaurant that feels like a city-level dining experience but with the warmth and intimacy of a suburban gem. It’s more than just food. It’s storytelling through hospitality. We’re elevating the local palate while creating a space where the community gathers, lingers, and connects. It’s a cultural anchor — and this is just the beginning.

 You recently opened Padel United Sports Club in Tenafly as interest in padel explodes globally. Why do you believe this sport—and this type of facility—is resonating so deeply with consumers right now?

 Padel wasn’t even the main driver. We set out to build a modern-day community center. We saw a void: thousands of young families in Bergen County looking for a premium, all-in-one destination for sport, wellness, and connection. Tennis and golf clubs no longer served that need.

 Then came padel. We hadn’t played it, but the data was impossible to ignore. When we finally got on the court, we were hooked. As someone who has played almost every sport competitively, I can say padel is the most addictive, accessible, and joy-filled game on the planet. The sport is just the spark. What we’re really doing is igniting a movement around community and holistic well-being.

 The Blackwood Club, your upcoming luxury gun and recreation club, is unlike anything else in the market. Who is this concept built for, and what can members expect from the indoor and outdoor experiences?

 The Blackwood Club was born from a question: What if luxury could meet freedom in a completely new way? This isn’t about guns. It’s about respect, safety, skill, and sanctuary. It’s for a discerning group of individuals who value discipline, craftsmanship, and the sacredness of the Second Amendment.

 But we didn’t stop there. We wrapped it in world-class design, added cigar lounges, culinary experiences, hospitality-grade staff, outdoor trails, and firepit gatherings. It’s part sporting club, part sanctuary — a place where ritual meets recreation. In a world that pulls us apart, Blackwood is about presence, precision, and pride.

 You were a co-founder of Bluestone Lane and played a major role in scaling it from a local café into a nationally recognized brand. Can you walk us through that journey—your role in its expansion, investment, and eventual exit?

 Bluestone Lane was a serendipitous collaboration. The founder approached me before it even had a name, and he had the foresight to know that if he wanted to open a hundred locations, he’d need a real estate and strategic partner to help make that vision tangible. Together, we scaled it from a neighborhood café into a national brand.

 It was an incredible journey. But in the end, it was his baby, and he needed to grow it with a singular strategy and vision. We had the opportunity to exit at a meaningful multiple, and I look back on it as a masterclass in brand architecture and scalability.

 What do you look for when evaluating whether a concept—whether a restaurant, club, or brand—has the potential to scale regionally or nationally?

 Three things: emotional stickiness, operational simplicity, and white space in the market. First, does the concept feel like something people fall in love with and want to share? Second, can we replicate it without diluting its essence? And third, are we solving a real unmet need with excellence?

 But the truth is, I also rely heavily on instinct. Pattern recognition built from two decades in the trenches. I know what it feels like when something has momentum. I know the energy of a winner. When I see it, I move.

 You’re also the President of the Tenafly Chamber of Commerce and a managing partner at Creative Land Group. How do you see real estate development and civic involvement complementing your business ventures?

 Business isn’t separate from community. It is community. When you understand how to build physical space with intention, you begin to see how architecture, commerce, and human connection are all part of one story.

 Through Creative Land Group and my role in the Chamber, I get to shape that story at a higher level. We’re not just placing businesses. We’re revitalizing entire towns. We’re creating gravity. That’s the essence of Cure Companies — building ecosystems that transform how people live, gather, and grow.

 What’s next for you and for Cure Companies? Are there new concepts or markets you’re especially excited about exploring in the next 12 months?

 We’re building what I believe will become a billion-dollar portfolio focused on doing things that have never been done before. Spring House is expanding. Padel United is rolling out to new markets. The Blackwood Club is poised to redefine a category. And we’re quietly working on a hotel concept that weaves together nature, luxury, and healing in ways that will change the industry.
