# Priority Capital Advisory Closes $12 Million Bridge Loan for Class A Multifamily Project in Vancouver, WA

Priority Capital Advisory has closed a $12 million bridge loan for Hudson West, a newly delivered 50-unit Class A multifamily property located at 2411 Broadway Street in Vancouver, WA. The financing was arranged on behalf of Cascadia Development Partners replacing a maturing construction loan, extending financial flexibility through lease-up and stabilization.

 “This was a deal where timing and structure were everything,” said Zachary Streit, Founder and President of Priority Capital Advisory. “We ran a hyper-competitive lender process and executed on an aggressive timeline to deliver a non-recourse lease-up bridge loan that met our client’s business plan and protected their equity. In this market, you need firepower and precision to close—this was both.”

 Hudson West is currently leasing up extremely well. The project consists of 11 studios, 25 one-bedrooms, and 14 two-bedrooms in a Scandinavian-contemporary three-story building. Each unit features private balconies, gourmet kitchens, walk-in closets, and high-end finishes. On-site amenities include a coffee bar, multiple common areas, and 39 secured parking spaces.

 Strategically located in a charming historic district just off Main Street and five minutes from the $1.6 billion Vancouver Waterfront masterplan, Hudson West offers renters access to top-tier urban lifestyle amenities while avoiding Portland’s state income tax.

 “We’ve worked with Zack on five financings now, and he continues to deliver under pressure,” said Scott Lindgren, Partner at Cascadia. “This was a critical execution for our firm, and he got it done.”

 Priority Capital Advisory has now closed $450 million in debt financing across 20 transactions since launching just over a year ago. The firm has built a reputation for hustling harder, moving faster, and unlocking liquidity for top-tier sponsors when others can’t.
