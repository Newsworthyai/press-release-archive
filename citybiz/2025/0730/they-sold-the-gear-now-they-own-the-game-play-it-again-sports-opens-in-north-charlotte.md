 Meet the Local Owners

 For Casey Staum and Alex Selim, opening a Play It Again Sports in North Charlotte isn’t just a business venture; it’s a homecoming, and a chance to give back to the kind of community that shaped them.

 Originally from Minnesota, both Casey and Alex come from backgrounds deeply rooted in sports. Alex began working at his brother’s Play It Again Sports in high school, eventually turning that part-time job into a decade-long career. Casey, a former sales associate at Alex’s brother’s Play It Again Sports location, focused primarily on hockey and made it to the NHL draft, but a slew of injuries impacted his career. After Casey graduated from college, he teamed up with Alex, and the two began dreaming about building something of their own. That dream brought them south to Charlotte, drawn by the opportunity and the city’s passionate sports culture. With 3,600 square feet of space, Casey and Alex are creating more than a store; they’re building a space where athletes at every level can find their gear, their team and their next chapter.

 “Play It Again Sports shaped who we are—not just as athletes, but as people,” said Alex. Opening our own store in Charlotte is our way of giving that same opportunity back to this community. Whether it’s a kid picking up their first set of golf clubs or a parent trying looking to save money, we’re here to make sports accessible, meaningful and fun for everyone.”
