# SRS Real Estate Partners Arranges $7.5 Million Ground Lease Sale of Wawa in Jackson Township, NJ

SRS Real Estate Partners has completed the $7.5 million ground lease (land ownership) sale of a newly constructed Wawa property located at 598 Cedar Swamp Road in Jackson Township, NJ.

 SRS Capital Markets Patrick Nutt and William Wamble represented the seller, an East Coast-based preferred Wawa developer. The buyer is a New Jersey-based private investor. The transaction marks the 138th Wawa sale nationwide for lead broker Patrick Nutt.

 The 4,736-square-foot Wawa sits on 1.94 acres at the signalized intersection of Cedar Swamp Road and West Commodore Boulevard, just south of Interstate 195. The property features a brand-new 20-year corporate-guaranteed lease with zero landlord responsibilities, offering the buyer a true management-free investment. It was sold to a local investor.

 “This Wawa offered the buyer long-term, passive income backed by a nationally recognized operator in a high-growth corridor,” said William Wamble, Executive Vice President & Principal with SRS Capital Markets. “It’s a testament to the continued demand we’re seeing for top-tier net lease assets.”

 He added that the property was sold off-market after the 1031 buyer was unable to secure another Wawa SRS had on market. SRS suggested this location knowing his criteria and proximity of the new Wawa to the investor’s primary residence just a few miles away.

 The Wawa is part of a broader mixed-use development that includes a liquor store and proposed retail space. The site offers hard-corner frontage, convenient access, and strong visibility. Additionally, the new Gardens at Jackson multifamily community, located just west of the property, will provide a built-in customer base for the tenant.

 This year, SRS Capital Markets has completed more than $1.2 billion in deal volume comprised of more than 350 transactions across the nation. SRS currently has in excess of 845 properties actively on the market with a market value surpassing $3.7 billion.
