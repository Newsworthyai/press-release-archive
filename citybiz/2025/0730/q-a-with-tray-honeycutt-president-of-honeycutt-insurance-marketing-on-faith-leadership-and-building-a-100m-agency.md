# Q&amp;A with Tray Honeycutt, President of Honeycutt Insurance: Marketing on Faith, Leadership, and Building a $100M Agency

From the Marine Corps to mentoring a network of high-performing agents, Tray Honeycutt has built a business rooted in discipline, purpose, and service. As the founder of Honeycutt Insurance Marketing and a partner at Integrity Marketing Group, Tray has helped thousands of families secure financial peace of mind and guided dozens of agents to six-figure careers.

 In this Q&A, he shares how personal loss shaped his mission, why mentorship is at the core of his model, and what it means to lead a “laboratory of faith” on the path to building a $100 million agency.

 Your journey from the Marine Corps to leading a multimillion dollar agency is remarkable. What mindset shifts helped you transition from military service to entrepreneurship?

 The Marine Corps taught me how to adapt in every circumstance. Perseverance and perspective allowed me to thrive as an entrepreneur. In many ways, the secret to succeeding in business is simply knowing how not to give up when most people throw in the towel. I learned to be grateful for problems, challenges and hardship because that was the point where everyone else would fold.

 You have shared that personal loss was a major turning point in your life. How did those experiences reshape your sense of purpose and lead you to the insurance industry?

 My father died in 2006. He didn’t have any life insurance, and my mom ended up in a very difficult financial situation. I remember an agent visiting our home years earlier, and my dad making an excuse that he wanted to sleep on it. When my dad ultimately passed away, I was so angry that the agent hadn’t cared enough to push him. He didn’t stand up for my family and that was his job. When I decided to become an agent, I made a conscious decision to put my clients’ families first. That meant challenging people and telling them the truth, no matter how uncomfortable it might be.

 When you first entered the field, what drew you to insurance, and when did you realize it could be more than just a job?

 Initially, I was attracted to the industry because of the earning potential, but then one of my clients passed away. The insurance company paid the claim, and I was able to hand-deliver the check. I saw firsthand how that family was able to keep their home. I saw that the kids were able to stay in the same school and maintain their support system after losing their dad. That was the moment my work became my ministry and I realized this was about more than just a paycheck.

 Honeycutt Insurance Marketing has helped thousands of families and transformed hundreds of careers. What do you believe makes your agency stand out in such a competitive industry?

 For us it’s about a long term business relationship. The goal is to equip, engage and support at every level. We focus on creating an environment that fosters independence, while embracing an open line of communication. Our agents are independent contractors, so we don’t treat them like employees. We treat them like partners and encourage collaboration. Some of our greatest growth has come from implementing and executing on the ideas of the team. The motto is “The Best Trains The Rest”. It keeps us nimble so we can adapt quickly. One thing about our business is things can change fast but you will never catch us flat footed. We always stay ahead of the curve.

 Mentorship plays a central role in your model. What does mentorship look like at your company and how has it changed the lives of your agents?

 It starts with the understanding that everyone shows up with different strengths and weaknesses. Our mentorship model meets people where they are and helps them grow with hands-on support, not just instructions. We pair every new agent with someone who’s already walked the path and is committed to helping them win. It’s about real-time coaching, honest feedback, and leading by example. That kind of environment builds confidence, sharpens skills, and turns potential into real success.

 You have helped dozens of agents earn six figure incomes and beyond. What qualities do your most successful team members share?

 The top performers on our team are all coachable, consistent, and committed to serving others. They show up hungry to learn, they stay focused on the process, and they put the client first.

 We can teach anyone the technical side of this business, but what really sets people apart is their mindset and work ethic. The ones who succeed in the long run are the ones who stay humble, show gratitude, take feedback seriously, and never stop growing.

 You describe your agency as a laboratory of faith. What does that mean to you and how does it influence your approach to leadership and growth?

 When I say we’re a laboratory of faith, I mean this is a place where belief is tested, strengthened, and proven. We give people a chance to bet on themselves, and then we walk with them as they grow into something greater.

 I really believe that faith influences how we lead, how we train, and how we treat each other. We believe in the potential of people, and we build systems that help them rise to it.

 Integrity Marketing became a key partner in your expansion. How has that relationship supported your goals and helped scale your impact?

 Their technology, marketing tools, and national network have helped us supercharge our growth, but the biggest factor in our ability to scale has been our shared values: Integrity, Family, Service, Respect, and Partnership. When you work every day with people who truly live by these values, it’s hard not to grow.

 What are some of the innovative tools or methods your team is using to stay ahead?

 We use a mix of technology and personal mentorship to help agents grow quickly and effectively. Our agents benefit from Integrity’s advanced CRM and quoting tools, and they also get hands-on support through live dials, daily coaching, and plug and play sales systems.

 But the real innovation is in how we combine all of that with a culture of belief, accountability, and leadership. The biggest thing is we just like being together and love to have fun. That’s what makes our team not just productive, but powerful.

 Looking ahead as you work toward building a one hundred million dollar agency, what is your biggest focus over the next year?

 Our biggest focus is staying disciplined and keeping things simple. Innovation and adaptability are certainly essential for growth, but one of the main reasons businesses stop growing is because they become a mile wide and an inch deep. Our strategy as an organization is to keep the main thing the main thing and keep moving forward. We’re committed to continuously improving the fundamentals.
