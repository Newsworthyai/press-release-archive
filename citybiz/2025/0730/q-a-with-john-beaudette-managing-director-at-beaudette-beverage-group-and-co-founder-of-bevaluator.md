# Q&amp;A with John Beaudette, Managing Director at Beaudette Beverage Group and Co-Founder of BEValuator

John Beaudette brings decades of hands-on experience in the beverage alcohol industry. Today he oversees Beaudette Beverage Group, a consortium of beverage related service, operational, and advisory companies. Mr. Beaudette is the founder and former CEO of MHW Ltd., located in Manhasset, New York (sold in 2022).

 Over the last twenty-five years, Beaudette/MHW has provided US import and distribution services to hundreds of producers and thousands of new, emerging and established spirits, wine, and beer brands. From 1985 to 1994, Mr. Beaudette worked with PepsiCo Inc. and its affiliate company Monsieur Henri Wines in the distribution of Stolichnaya Vodka and other wine and spirit brands. During this period, Mr. Beaudette held key positions such as Director of Planning for PepsiCo Wines & Spirits Intl. and V. P. of Finance & CFO of Monsieur Henri Wines Ltd. Prior to joining PepsiCo, Mr. Beaudette was Manager of Accounting for Somerset Importers Ltd., US importers of Tanqueray and Johnnie Walker and other spirit brands.

 He served on the Board of Directors of The National Association of Beverage Importers Inc. (NABI) in Washington DC for twenty years and is a former Chairman of the organization. He has also served on the Board of Directors of The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS) in Washington DC. Mr. Beaudette is a frequent speaker and lecturer at beverage alcohol events around the world. He holds a BS degree in Accounting from Villanova University and passed the Certified Public Accountant exam in New York.

 What’s your background?

 I’m originally from Long Island, New York, and graduated with a BS degree in Accounting from Villanova University. After obtaining operational and financial audit experience (passed CPA) with two publicly traded fortune 500 companies, I joined PepsiCo International and their affiliate, Monsieur Henri Wines, where I served in finance and leadership roles-Controller, Director of Planning at Pepsi Wines & Spirits, and ultimately CFO of Monsieur Henri Wines, Pepsi’s affiliated national wine and spirits import and distribution company.

 What many people don’t realize is that PepsiCo played a pivotal role in shaping the imported vodka category in the U.S. They introduced Stolichnaya (Stoli) through a fascinating countertrade deal with the Soviet Union, where Pepsi concentrate was shipped into the USSR in exchange for vodka that could be sold for cash in the U.S. It was actually Vice President Nixon who helped initiate the program back in 1959. For years, Pepsi was the only Western product available in the Soviet Union. It was a masterclass in global trade, branding, and strategic innovation.

 After PepsiCo sold its stake in Stoli in the early ‘90s, I partnered with two former Pepsi colleagues to acquire the affiliated U.S. distribution platform and that became MHW, a service-based import and distribution company focused on helping emerging and established wine, spirits, and beer brands get to market.

 With the rise of the internet and the explosion of new brands entering the space, MHW grew rapidly. Over 25 years, I had the privilege of serving as CEO and working with thousands of brands, many of which went on to successful exits. We built MHW into the leading service provider for brands needing access, compliance, and infrastructure in the U.S. market.

 A couple of years ago, we sold the company, and since then I’ve been advising entrepreneurs, investors, and brand owners in the industry. That experience, combined with decades of seeing what leads to successful exits, is what ultimately led to the creation of BEValuator.

 What is BEValuator and what led you to create it?

 BEValuator is the first automated valuation engine built exclusively for spirits brands. It delivers a tailored, data-driven valuation in minutes – no consultants, spreadsheets, or guesswork required.

 It was built to solve a problem I saw again and again during my 25 years as CEO of MHW, where we supported thousands of brands – many that went on to successful exits. Too often, founders were forced to rely on static, outdated valuation methods that didn’t reflect their brand’s real performance or potential. And in a market where billions have been invested and deals like Grey Goose and Casamigos set sky-high expectations, most brands still lacked a clear roadmap to get there.

 BEValuator changes that. It uses real acquisition data and strategic inputs to calculate a dynamic valuation that evolves with your brand. It shows you what drives value, where you stand today, and how to improve over time.

 And it’s not just for founders chasing an exit. Even if you’re not planning to sell, understanding the same metrics acquirers care about-growth quality, margin strength, scalability-can dramatically improve your company’s profitability and decision-making.

 Its valuation built for action. Whether you’re fundraising, scaling, or exit-ready, BEValuator helps you move forward with confidence.

 What does the process look like for brands to onboard and who should use BEValuator?

 BEValuator is simple to use but backed by a sophisticated engine. Brands start by entering their financials, things like Net Sales, Case Volume, and Marketing Spend, and then respond to a set of strategic questions about their pricing, distribution, supply chain, and marketing footprint.

 Behind the scenes, BEValuator uses proprietary algorithms that combine quantitative analysis, based on actual acquisition data, with a qualitative scorecard built on real-world factors that influence growth and profitability. This hybrid approach reflects how strategic acquirers actually assess value.

 In minutes, users receive a comprehensive valuation report showing their projected value range, where they fall within that range, and-crucially, what’s driving their valuation up or down.

 It’s designed for founders, investors, and advisors. Whether you are fundraising, planning for growth, or preparing for a future exit, BEValuator gives you a clear roadmap. And even if you’re not selling, understanding these drivers helps you run a more profitable, scalable business.

 So, whether you’re building to exit or simply building smarter, BEValuator gives you the insight to move forward with confidence.

 Why is being mission driven and supporting charities important to you? How do you support various charities through BEValuator?

 Supporting clean water access has been a cause close to my heart for a long time. While I was still leading MHW, we launched Liquid for Life, a charitable initiative focused on building clean water wells in underserved communities. That mission has continued through BEValuator, and it remains central to what we do today.

 Over the past decade, we’ve partnered with Cross Catholic Outreach, and prior to that, St. Patrick Fathers, to fund the construction of water wells in regions like rural Africa and Haiti-areas where access to clean, safe drinking water is still a daily challenge. Every BEValuator subscription directly contributes to this effort. There’s a beautiful symbolism here too: the magic behind any great spirit begins with the water. It’s the foundation of every bottle, every brand. So, it’s fitting that our work in the spirits industry helps support clean water initiatives around the world.

 For us, being mission-driven isn’t just a statement, it’s a throughline. We’re proud that BEValuator helps build value for brands while also helping to deliver something even more essential to communities in need.

 Can you share your thoughts on the future of the spirits industry and any other upcoming trends?

 The spirits industry is in a period of transition. While we’ve seen case sales slow over the last 18 months, that reflects a mix of factors-post-COVID consumption shifts, inflation and economic uncertainty, tariffs, growing interest in health and wellness, and the rise of non-alcoholic options and cannabis-infused beverages.

 But let’s keep perspective: this is still a 300-million-case industry in the U.S. alone, and every year we’re adding 4 million new legal-age drinkers. These consumers are making fresh decisions about what their beverage choice will be-and they’re doing it in a digital-first world, where brand access and information are just a tap away.

 That’s a huge opportunity. The ability for new and emerging brands to take share from legacy players is real – especially for those who market smartly, build authenticity, and stay agile. AI will further accelerate this shift by enabling consumers to research, compare, and explore brands instantly, whether they’re in a store aisle or online.

 From a trend perspective, premiumization remains strong, and we’re still seeing momentum in tequila, American whiskey, mezcal, RTDs, and even non-alcoholic spirits. But more than categories, the future will belong to brands that combine creativity with discipline-ones that know how to grow profitably and connect with today’s more informed consumer.

 That’s exactly why we built BEValuator. In a more selective market, the brands that succeed will be the ones that understand what drives their value, and how to strengthen it.

 Anything else you’d like to share?

 Yes, beyond brand building and valuation, I think it’s important to recognize that the beverage alcohol industry plays a major role in our economy and society. In the U.S. alone, the industry supports over 4.5 million jobs and generates nearly $300 billion in total economic impact, including substantial contributions to hospitality, retail, agriculture, and logistics.

 It’s also deeply connected to local communities. From bartenders and servers to distillers and distributors, this industry helps power the restaurant and hospitality sectors across the country.

 And on the public health and safety front, the industry, especially through organizations like the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S. (DISCUS) and its affiliate Responsibility.org, has taken real leadership. They work closely with MADD and other advocacy groups to promote responsible consumption and reduce impaired driving. One example: they’ve been strong supporters of mandatory alcohol detection systems (interlock technology) in new vehicles, which could effectively eliminate drunk driving fatalities in the future.

 The industry is also investing in diversity, sustainability, and education, helping ensure that the next generation of beverage alcohol leaders is more inclusive and forward-thinking than ever before.

 So yes, this is a dynamic and competitive industry, but it’s also a responsible, resilient one. And it’s exciting to build tools like BEValuator to support not just business success, but a stronger, safer industry overall.
