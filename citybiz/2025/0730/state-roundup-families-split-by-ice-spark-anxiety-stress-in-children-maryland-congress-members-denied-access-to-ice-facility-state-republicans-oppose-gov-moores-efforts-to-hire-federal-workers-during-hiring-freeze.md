 STATE REPUBLICANS OPPOSE MOORE PUSH TO HIRE FEDERAL WORKERS AMID FREEZE: Maryland House and Senate Republicans said they oppose a continuing effort by Gov. Wes Moore (D) to hire displaced federal workers. Moore asked the Legislative Policy Committee in June to approve the use of $30,000 to help cover the salaries of two new part-time contractual employees to handle recruitment and hiring of federal employees.Since making the request, Moore announced a hiring freeze in most state agencies and is also looking to reduce state payroll through a voluntary buyout program.

 POLITICAL SCIENTISTS: RISE IN DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS REFLECTS CHANGING ATTITUDES: Political scientists in Maryland believe the rise of self-described “Democratic socialist” candidates reflects not just a backlash to President Donald Trump, but changing attitudes toward left-wing ideologies overall. Carson Swick/The Baltimore Sun.

 STUDY: B’MORE INCINERATORS CAUSE $100M IN HEALTH HARM: A new study from University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University researchers finds that Baltimore’s two waste incinerators are causing nearly $100 million in health damages to residents of Baltimore and D.C. Scott Maucione/WYPR-FM.

 COMMENTARY: TIT FOR TAT, MARYLAND MAY GERRYMANDER AGAIN: As the first to challenge Maryland’s congressional district apportionment for the 2010 decade, I was heartened when House of Delegates Majority Leader David Moon (D-Montgomery Co.) announced his plan to draft legislation that would automatically redistrict Maryland if other states engage in out-of-cycle redrawing of congressional districts. Howard Gorrell/MarylandReporter.

 BALTIMORE COUNTY WON’T MEET RENEWABLES DEADLINE: In 2021, then Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski signed an executive order, setting a goal that the county government will get 100 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2026. It’s not going to make it. John Lee/WYPR-FM.

 KLAUMEIER RESPONDS TO IG CRITICISM WITH OPEN LETTER: Baltimore County Executive Kathy Klausmeier released an “open letter” on her appointment of Khadija Walker as the new Inspector General. Walker was appointed to the post on July 24, despite incumbent Kelly Madigan, who has the support of the County Council, being named a finalist in the process to keep her job. Klausmeier said Walker “stood out as the most qualified candidate to elevate the Office of the Inspector General.” Danny Tow/WBBF-TV News.

 FORMER BOSS INVOLVED IN WALKER’s HIRE AS IG: When Khadija Walker announced online last fall that she got a new job at USAID, one of the first to congratulate her was Arthur A. Elkins Jr., her former boss at the EPA. When Baltimore County Executive Kathy Klausmeier announced last week that Walker was picked to be the county’s new inspector general appointee, among those most closely involved was Elkins, one of two who joined Klausmeier in the final round of interviews that resulted in Walker’s selection. Mark Reutter/Baltimore Brew.

 B’MORE INCREASES SUPPORT TO PENN NORTH AFTER OVERDOSES: Penn North is receiving increased support from city officials following two mass overdose events and a suspicious death in the area.

 MORTON MINTZ, MUCKRAKING POST BUSINESS REPORTER, DIES AT 103: He wasn’t a political reporter or columnist, but he and his tireless, noteworthy work deserves mention here. Morton Mintz, a Washington Post reporter who brought a muckraker’s zeal to business reporting, notably by helping expose the baby-deforming drug thalidomide and General Motors’ efforts to smear a little-known consumer advocate named Ralph Nader, died July 28 at his home in Washington. He was 103. His son, Daniel Mintz, confirmed the death but did not cite a specific cause. Stefanie Dazio/The Washington Post.
