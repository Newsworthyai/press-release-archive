Thompson Thrift, a full-service nationally recognized real estate company, announced today that its CEO, Paul Thrift, has been recognized for the fourth consecutive year in the Indiana Business Journal’s Indiana 250 list. The list honors Indiana’s most influential and impactful business and community leaders. Honorees include executives and up-and-comers from public and private companies, law firms, universities, not-for-profits, government groups and community organizations.

 “I’m incredibly humbled and honored to be included once again among such a respected group of leaders,” said Paul Thrift, CEO of Thompson Thrift. “This honor truly reflects the hard work and unwavering commitment of our entire team. Their passion for excellence, service and leadership continues to inspire me every day.”

 First launched in 2022, IBJ’s Indiana 250 list was compiled by the executives, editors and newsroom staff at IBJ Media’s three news brands: Indianapolis Business Journal, Inside Indiana Business and Indiana Lawyer.

 Since Thrift co-founded the company in 1986 with John Thompson, Thompson Thrift has grown from a locally focused development and construction company into a full-service, integrated enterprise with more than 650 team members. The company has successfully developed more than $6 billion in real estate, providing more than 25,000 multifamily homes in 23 states, and is engaged in all aspects of acquisition, development, construction, leasing and management of quality multifamily and mixed-use projects.

 A recent highlight for Thompson Thrift this past year included continued progress on the $750 million expansion of Fishers District outside Indianapolis, which has the company’s business units partnering to bring first-class developments to Indiana’s residents and visitors.

 Thrift was born and raised in Terre Haute and graduated from Indiana State University. A lifelong learner who takes great pride in the opportunity to mentor tomorrow’s leaders, Thrift has served and chaired a variety of business, civic and non-profit organizations across the state and is enthusiastic about Thompson Thrift’s recently announced partnership with Indiana State University that includes $1.3 million for a 15-year paid summer internship program to qualified students majoring in construction management.

 At a corporate level, Thompson Thrift’s philanthropic arm, TT Serve, partners with more than 35 local and national organizations with a key focus on community revitalization, youth and education. The group also seeks to aid those in need in international communities.
