# Q&amp;A with Marc Phillips, Physical Therapist and Consultant at FYZICAL Therapy and Balance Centers

Marc Phillips, PT, DPT, OCS, is a physical therapist with FYZICAL Therapy & Balance Centers. Educated at Brigham Young University, California State University Northridge, and Temple University, he specializes in balance disorders. Marc enjoys coaching sports, raising his four children, and spending time with his dogs. He is passionate about empowering patients and mentoring the next generation of physical therapists.

 You’ve earned multiple advanced degrees and worked across different specialties — what led you to join FYZICAL, and how did that path lead to becoming a franchise owner?

 My passion for helping others led me to physical therapy. When I discovered FYZICAL Therapy and Balance Centers, I found the opportunity to treat balance disorders and help older adults stay independent while reducing their risk of falls. One of the experiences that really shaped my path was working with a patient, who initially came in with low back pain. As we treated him, we realized something more was going on, and he was ultimately diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.

 At first, he was upset and didn’t want to continue PT. But six months later, he came back and asked me to be his therapist. I’ve worked with him on and off ever since, even seeing him at his house during COVID. Watching how he’s faced his challenges head-on was incredibly inspiring, and made me start thinking more seriously about fall risk.

 Around that same time, I saw how aging was affecting my own grandparents. All of them lived into their 90s but became increasingly sedentary because they were afraid of falling. Then my grandmother fell and broke her hip, which really hit home. When it’s your own family, it becomes deeply personal. I knew there had to be a better way to prevent these kinds of outcomes.

 Before joining FYZICAL, I was a board-certified orthopedic specialist treating everything from broken bones to torn ligaments. We’d fix the immediate issue, but many patients left without any plan for preventing future injuries. That gap — the lack of long-term fall prevention — is exactly what FYZICAL fills. It gave me the tools, training, and confidence to help patients avoid repeat injuries and truly improve their quality of life.

 As someone passionate about helping older adults regain mobility and independence, what stood out to you about FYZICAL’s mission and how it approaches patient care differently?

 FYZICAL is committed to helping older adults stay independent by improving their quality of life through our balance programs, physical therapy, and strengthening programs. What really drew me in is the preventative mindset. Most outpatient clinics treat one issue at a time, whether it’s an orthopedic or balance problem, and send patients on their way. At FYZICAL, we’re trained across multiple specialties, including ortho, balance, and pelvic health, which allows us to take a more holistic approach.

 Patients feel the difference. Our clinics are thoughtfully designed and include specialized equipment — like overhead safety harnesses and shuttle systems — that give people the confidence to push their limits in a safe environment. But it’s more than just the equipment. Every patient follows a personalized program built around their needs and goals. That level of individualized care, and the way we address the root cause rather than just the symptoms, is what sets FYZICAL apart.

 FYZICAL’s Partnership Advantage Program uniquely positions PTs to become business owners — what drew you to this model, and what support did FYZICAL offer in helping you transition from clinician to entrepreneur?

 As a physical therapist who always wanted to own a clinic, this program was the solution. It creates collaborative partnerships between PTs and investors, therefore combining strong clinical skills with business acumen, which benefits everyone involved, especially the patients and communities we serve.

 What’s unique is that many PTs, myself included, never received business training in school. The Partnership Advantage Program fills that gap by providing critical support and letting you know you’re not doing it alone. FYZICAL assigns a regional franchise consultant who helps with everything from daily management reports to strategic planning. They offer webinars, tools, and ongoing resources that make a big difference. Beyond the formal support, there’s also an incredible sense of camaraderie among other owners. Business ownership can feel isolating at times as you can’t always share certain challenges with employees, so being able to talk to fellow owners who truly understand the experience has been invaluable.

 Since joining FYZICAL, I’ve been part of launching several clinics. I originally owned seven that I ended up selling, and today I have ownership in three clinics in the Denver metro area. The model works, and I’ve grown so much from the experience.

 The TeamFYZICAL.com graduate program is gaining momentum at a time when many new PTs are struggling to find strong first roles — how is FYZICAL closing that gap and supporting the next generation of physical therapists?

 By connecting graduate students with clinics across the country, FYZICAL creates a seamless bridge from school to practice. The training and expertise that exist within our clinics translate really well to new grads, and mentorship plays a huge role in helping them launch their careers. We’ve had a lot of students come through our doors, from undergrads to final-year DPTs, and TeamFYZICAL.com gives them the chance to explore the clinic before committing. It’s like an extended interview on both sides. Students get to see if it’s the right fit, and we get a sense of whether they’re someone we’d like to bring on.

 It’s also helped us build strong relationships with PT programs and professors who are looking to place students in more specialized, forward-thinking environments. As a recruiting tool, it’s been one of the most valuable resources we have.

 You’ve worked closely with students and new grads — what makes FYZICAL’s clinical training and mentorship model so effective in developing confident, long-term hires?

 New grads want guidance. They’re looking for someone to help them build confidence and grow into their professional identity, and FYZICAL provides that in a structured, consistent way. We have a formal mentorship program led by an experienced PT who supports all new hires remotely through weekly check-ins. That ensures they’re getting consistent training across the board. We also offer FYZICAL College — an internal learning platform that helps new grads continue their education and specialization.

 What makes it really effective is the combination of formal mentorship with informal, day-to-day support in the clinic. Students can ask real-time questions, get feedback on challenging cases, and develop their clinical reasoning in a practical setting.

 From my perspective, the biggest marker of growth is when I see mentees begin to realize how much more there is to learn. That mindset shift — from thinking you need to have all the answers to being open and curious — is what makes a great PT and a future leader. I wish I had been more open to that early in my own career.

 What advice would you give to young physical therapists who want to move beyond clinical care and explore leadership or ownership opportunities early in their careers?

 Follow your dream and learn as much as you can along the way. Early on, I had an incredible mentor who showed me not just how to treat patients, but how to run a successful practice. That knowledge saved me a lot of time, money, and energy when I became an owner myself.

 If you’re a PT considering business ownership, just go for it! It is intimidating at first, but it’s also one of the most rewarding things you can do. Being both a clinician and a leader in your own business gives you a sense of purpose and impact you don’t get anywhere else. FYZICAL also offers leadership development resources, like FLT (FYZICAL Leadership Training) School, which I found incredibly uplifting. There were dozens of us all working to become better leaders, learning from each other’s successes and failures. That kind of environment keeps me sharp and constantly growing.

 The reality is, ownership isn’t easy, but you’re not alone. Learning from others, seeing how they’re innovating, and knowing we’re all in it together makes the journey not just possible, but well worth it.
