# Woofie’s Marks 21 Years of Serving Pets and Their People with Nationwide “Yappy Hour” Celebrations

Woofie’s®, a leading provider of premium mobile pet care services, is celebrating its 21st birthday with nationwide celebrations that spotlight the deep bonds between pets, their families, and the communities they live in. Over 21 years (147 in dog years), Woofie’s has grown from a local dog-walking business into a trusted national brand. With 67 franchise locations, Woofie’s provides exceptional care and peace of mind for pet parents with services including mobile grooming from state-of-the-art pet spa vans, dog walking, pet sitting, supported with access to 24/7 telehealth services through Pet Vet Connection.

 To mark its 21st anniversary, Woofie’s locations nationwide will host birthday-themed events—including “Yappy Hour” fundraisers where many Woofie’s franchises will be “Pouring it Forward” by donating 21% of proceeds to benefit local animal rescue centers and other nonprofits. Check out Woofie’s nationwide events.

 “For 21 years, Woofie’s has been there for pet parents through every stage of life—from a puppy’s first grooming, to helping senior pets age with comfort and care,” said Woofie’s Co-Founder and President Amy Addington. “This anniversary is about celebrating the trust and love we’ve built with our clients and franchisees, and about the vibrant communities and special pets we’ve been honored to serve.”

 A Story of Community and Trust

 Founded in 2004 by two neighbors who shared a passion for animals and a vision for providing professional, reliable mobile pet care, Woofie’s has grown through its unique blend of entrepreneurial spirit and genuine connection to pets and people. Today, Woofie’s franchise owners across the U.S. are bringing that same heart-driven approach to their own neighborhoods.

 One such story comes from Ana Hul, Woofie’s North Virginia owner and previous Woofie’s Franchisee of the Year recipient.

 “I was a Woofie’s customer for eight years and then decided to become a Woofie’s franchise owner because I wanted to get into the pet industry, and they are the experts,” says Hul. “The best part is I’m following my passion, caring for animals and working with pet parents everyday. That’s what excites me about this business.”

 Looking to the Future of Pet Services Growth

 The market for pet services in the U.S. continues to grow. Total U.S. pet industry expenditures reached $152 billion in 2024, with $157 billion in sales projected for 2025 with 51% of U.S. households owning a dog and 37% of U.S. households owning a cat, according to the American Pet Products Association 2025 State of the Industry Report.

 With this growth, Woofie’s remains focused on expanding its network of franchises and introducing innovative services to meet the evolving needs of pet parents.

 “Turning 21 is a milestone not just for our brand, but for everyone who has been part of our journey from franchise owners, team members, and our customers across the country,” added Addington. “Our vision for the future is rooted in the same values that brought us here: trust, community, and a passion for pets.”
