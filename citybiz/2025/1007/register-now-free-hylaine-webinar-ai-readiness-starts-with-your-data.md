WHAT: Hylaine Webinar on how AI Readiness Starts with Your Data

 AI adoption is accelerating, but poor data foundations are blocking results. More than 50% of AI projects have been delayed, failed, or underperformed because of data readiness issues.

 Since ChatGPT raised executive expectations, tech leaders have been working fast to turn AI ideas into business value. But scattered, siloed, and error-prone data is standing in the way.

 Join our webinar to cut through the hype and learn how to build the strong data foundation your organization needs to scale AI with confidence.

 In 45 minutes, you’ll learn:

 * 5 five most common hurdles organizations face when preparing data for AI
* Best practices and pitfalls leaders should be aware of when building data foundations for AI
* 4 practical and actionable approaches to solve the AI data readiness problem

 WHEN: October 15 at 12 PM ET

 WHY THIS WEBINAR MATTERS:  Despite mixed results, nearly two-thirds of top executives are pushing harder on AI because they fear falling behind competitors. Technology leaders are under pressure to deliver results, not experiments. That pressure will only grow.

 WHO SHOULD ATTEND:

 * CIOs, CTOs, and CDOs
* VPs and Directors of IT
* AI, Data and Analytics leaders
