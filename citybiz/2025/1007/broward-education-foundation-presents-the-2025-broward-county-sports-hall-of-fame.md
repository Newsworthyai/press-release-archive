 Isaac Bruce, a graduate of Dillard High School and current Broward County resident is a Pro Football Hall of Fame wide receiver who played 16 NFL seasons, primarily with the St. Louis Rams. Renowned for his precise route-running, intelligence, and clutch performances, he retired among the league’s all-time leaders in receiving yards, receptions, and touchdowns. A four-time Pro Bowl selection, Bruce sealed the Rams’ Super Bowl XXXIV victory with a memorable 73-yard touchdown catch. He holds numerous franchise records and had his jersey retired in 2010. Off the field, he founded the Isaac Bruce Foundation, promoting youth health, wellness, and education. Through his foundation, he continues to inspire young people to lead active, informed, and purpose-driven lives.

 Isaac Diaz is a seasoned professional saddle bronc rider with over $1.5 million in career earnings and seven Wrangler National Finals Rodeo qualifications. Growing up in Davie, the three-time state high school champion went on to win a collegiate national title with Tarleton State University.

Diaz continues to compete at a high level, with career highlights spanning nearly two decades and dozens of titles in his event. Off the circuit, he shares life with his wife Britany, a two-time NFR qualifier in barrel racing, and their daughter Whitlee.

 Daniel Kanell, M.D. was a standout athlete in high school, he overcame a major injury to become a track and field star and Scholar Athlete at the University of Pittsburgh before earning his medical degree there. His career path led him from an OB-GYN internship in Brooklyn to a prestigious orthopedic surgery residency at NYU and a fellowship in the UK, where he also played professional basketball. After serving as a U.S. Army medical officer, he settled in Broward County and built a legacy in sports medicine, becoming team physician for the Miami Dolphins, Miami Marlins, Fort Lauderdale Strikers and Miami Fusion, as well as a longtime consultant for MLB Spring Training. Deeply committed to youth athletics, Dr. Kanell helped launch the Broward County School Board Sports Medicine Program and served as president of the Broward County Orthopaedic Society. A devoted husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, his legacy extends far beyond the exam room and into the heart of the South Florida sports community.

 Kathryn Jane ‘Kathy’ Sallade was a trailblazer in swimming and a celebrated Deaflympian. A Fort Lauderdale High School alumna, she became the fastest deaf backstroker in the world, winning five gold medals and setting five world records across the 1969 and 1973 Deaflympics. She had the honor of being the first American female athlete to carry the U.S. flag at an opening ceremony. After retiring from competition, Kathy dedicated herself to coaching, serving on the U.S. Deaflympics coaching staff in 1977 and 1983, and as head coach for the 2007 Pan American Games for the Deaf. Inducted into the Gallaudet University Sports Hall of Fame, Kathy’s legacy is marked by her resilience, work ethic and groundbreaking achievements despite being born with profound hearing loss. A devoted single mother of four, she now resides in Alameda, California.

 Scot Shields carved out a remarkable 10-year career as one of Major League Baseball’s most reliable setup pitchers. A 1993 Fort Lauderdale High School graduate, he was a walk on at Broward College before earning All-American honors at Lincoln Memorial University, where he once pitched a record-setting 16-inning game. Drafted by the Anaheim Angels in 1997, he became a key contributor to the team’s 2002 World Series Championship. Known for his heavy sinker and fearless mentality, Shields logged nearly 700 innings and 600 strikeouts while posting a career 3.18 ERA. Sports Illustrated named him “Set-Up Man of the Decade” for the 2000s, and he represented Team USA in the World Baseball Classic and MLB Japan All-Star Series. Shields still holds the Angels’ all-time record for holds (155). He retired in 2010 after playing his entire career with the franchise and now lives in Michigan with his wife, Jaimie, and daughters, Kayla and Ella.

 Steve Strand has been a fixture at St. Thomas Aquinas High School for more than four decades, leaving an indelible mark as a player, coach, mentor and leader. A member of the school’s basketball team from 1972–1976, Strand was known as the ultimate “glue guy” on the 1975 state runner-up squad, bringing toughness and teamwork. After graduation, he returned as a coach, first in football, then basketball, eventually serving as head coach of the boys’ basketball program from 1996 to 2019. Under his leadership, STA earned nine district championships, four Final Four appearances and its first boys’ basketball state title in 2001. Strand’s career record of 397-186 reflects both his coaching acumen and his ability to inspire players, many of whom went on to play in college and professionally. Even after retiring from high school coaching, he continues to contribute through AAU basketball and mentoring roles. Strand’s greatest pride is seeing his former players grow into responsible men, husbands and fathers.

 Cardinal Gibbons High School – 1975–1979 State 4A Championship Women’s Volleyball Teams

 In the mid-1970s, Cardinal Gibbons High School rose to national prominence in girls’ volleyball, building one of Florida’s most dominant dynasties. Under the leadership of legendary head coach Louise A. Crocco, the Lady Chiefs captured five consecutive FHSAA 4A state championships from 1975 through 1979, establishing a foundation of excellence that would shape the program for decades.

 This remarkable run came during a time of rapid growth in women’s athletics following the passage of Title IX. With strong fundamentals, discipline, teamwork, and an unshakable “never quit” attitude, the Lady Chiefs consistently outmatched opponents across the state. Their game was defined by precision serving, stifling defense, and aggressive, intelligent offense—a style of play that filled their gymnasium with school and community supporters and inspired a generation of young female athletes in South Florida.

 The JV program, led by Jude Abrams, played a vital role in developing players who would go on to fuel the varsity team’s continued success. Many members of these championship squads advanced to careers as collegiate athletes, coaches, and mentors, carrying forward the legacy of Cardinal Gibbons volleyball.

 Coach Crocco, whose teams went on to claim a state-record 18 championships and who was later inducted into the FHSAA Hall of Fame, remains proud not only of her athletes’ achievements on the court but also of their successes beyond sports—as leaders, professionals, and contributors to society.

 Today, the school and its Hall of Fame recognize the 1976–1979 state championship teams for their historical contributions, while honoring the full 1975–1979 dynasty as a defining era in Cardinal Gibbons athletics. Their accomplishments remain a cornerstone of Broward County’s sports heritage.
