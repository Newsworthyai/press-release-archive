 ABOUT MEALS ON WHEELS ATLANTA

 Meals On Wheels Atlanta (MOWA) was founded in 1965 to support seniors struggling with hunger and social isolation. For over 60 years, MOWA has grown from a small soup kitchen to an organization that has delivered over six million lifesaving meals throughout the Atlanta area.

 MOWA has expanded its program offerings to respond to other critical needs in the community. The nonprofit now offers multiple services to support Atlanta seniors, including personalized and therapeutic home-delivered and family-style meals, home repair services, an emergency food pantry and a pet pantry allowing seniors to remain at home with their pets, which are sometimes the only family they have.

 Since MOWA raises 97% of its funding from private donations each year, the nonprofit has expanded fundraising efforts to include social enterprises 1705WEST, Atlanta’s Premier Event Space with a Purpose; and Purposeful Gourmet Foods, The Snack that Gives Back! All proceeds from both efforts benefit MOWA’s meals program.
