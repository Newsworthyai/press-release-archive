# Sunday Morning Artisan Market Launches at Plantation Walk

Weekly outdoor market to feature local artisans, live music, food, and more.

 Plantation Walk, Broward County’s premier entertainment district, will debut the Sunday Morning Artisan Market on October 12, 2025, offering a weekly showcase of South Florida’s best local artisans, craft makers, and specialty vendors. The market will take place every Sunday from 10 AM to 2 PM in the Plantation Walk Plaza.

 Shoppers will discover handcrafted goods, art, jewelry, home decor, baked treats, gourmet foods, and specialty items while enjoying live music throughout the Plaza. The celebration continues into the evening with additional live music every Sunday from 4–8 PM.

 “We’re excited to introduce a new Sunday tradition to Plantation Walk,” said Michael Cleland, General Manager of Plantation Walk. “The Artisan Market not only highlights the creativity of South Florida’s local artisans but also adds to the community-driven family experience our guests have come to expect.”

 Visitors can also explore Plantation Walk’s two dozen restaurants, shops, services, and experiences just steps away from the Plaza, making the Artisan Market a complete weekend destination. Parking and admission are free.
