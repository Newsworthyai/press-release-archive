# Q&amp;A with William Koppelmann, CEO and Chairman of Standard Premium Finance

William “Bill” Koppelmann is CEO and Chairman of Standard Premium Finance (OTCQX: SPFX), a leading Miami-based specialty finance company, which provides insurance premium financing solutions for businesses and individuals. Bill built Standard into the recognized industry leader it is today, supplying loans surpassing $1.5 billion to businesses and individuals since its inception in 1991.

 Can you start by giving us a snapshot of Standard Premium Finance? What you do, and what sets the company apart in your view?

 Absolutely. Standard Premium Finance is primarily a specialty finance company that provides premium financing solutions for property and casualty insurance. We provide the means for a collateralized loan to customers seeking payment flexibility on their insurance policies. It’s a niche industry, almost working behind the scenes; but it is a multi-billion dollar industry.

 We differentiate through our emphasis of combining service with competitive, flexible financing structures. We’ve built strong operational capabilities, invested in technology and maintained a customer-first mindset. We can bring the service level of a community partner that the larger companies, many of which are bank-owned, are not nimble enough to provide.

 Standard Premium Finance recently announced an increase in its credit facility to $115 million. What does that mean for the business moving forward?

 That was an important milestone for us. Expanding our revolving credit facility provides the liquidity we need to fund more loan originations and support our growth strategy. It also signals confidence from our lending partners in the strength of our model and financial discipline. For us, it’s about having the resources in place to serve more agents and policyholders while keeping our balance sheet strong.

 You also announced the addition of a new sales representative in the Midwest. How does that fit into your overall expansion strategy?

 Yes, that’s Renee Magness, we’re so happy to have her join the team. She is an industry veteran with a large customer base. She brings a wealth of experience in premium finance and strong relationships in the Midwest market. That region has tremendous growth potential, and having someone with her expertise and network allows us to hit the ground running. It’s consistent with our strategy of expanding geographically, deepening our agent relationships and building a sales team that can grow with the company.

 What have been some of the biggest challenges in scaling the business, especially given the regulatory and capital demands in the insurance finance arena?

 There are several interlocking challenges. I would say capital requirements, compliance and changing technology would be the most important. Our availability of capital drives the ability to grow, allowing us to fund more and larger loans. Financing insurance premiums requires significant capital, and regulations vary across states which adds complexity. We need to ensure compliance while being able to deploy capital efficiently.

 Technology and customer expectations have also shifted rapidly. People expect seamless digital experiences, integrations with agency management systems, online portals and automated reminders. These are no longer “nice-to-have”, they are requirements. So, it is important to continue to push the envelope with technological innovation to maintain our competitive edge.

 Overcoming these challenges means investing in infrastructure, hiring talent who understand both finance and the tech side, ensuring regulatory compliance, and staying disciplined on operations. We’re seeing returns on that in our recent financial performance.

 Speaking of financial performance, how has Standard Premium Finance been performing lately? What metrics are you most proud of?

 The recent results have been encouraging. Being a public company, I must be careful how much I share but can point you to all our most recent public filings on our website or our ticker symbol: SPFX. 2025 has been a breakout year for us, while 2024 saw revenue increase an exciting 25% year-over-year, and net income surged 84% compared to 2023. Loan originations have also risen in double digits during 2025.

 How are you balancing growth with risk? Are there particular levers you pull to ensure that you’re not taking on too much credit exposure, especially as you expand?

 It’s a balancing act, yes. The key is to maintain underwriting discipline. Even as we scale, we refuse to loosen credit risk standards, which is fundamental to protecting our portfolio value. By combining our decades of industry experience with our proprietary data analytics, we can ensure proper underwriting standards are employed consistently and, in most cases, automatically.

 Our latest risk focus is to increase our geographic diversity. Operating in multiple states helps distribute regulatory and market risk. Our roots are here in Florida, as we grew from a local contender to the regional powerhouse we are today. By expanding further, we mitigate concentration risk and stay true to our slogan: Local Presence, National Power.

 What role does technology play in your roadmap? Are there specific innovations you’re focused on to improve the experience for agents, carriers, or policyholders?

 Technology is central to our growth plan. We are proud to own and develop our proprietary technology. This gives us the flexibility to drive innovation and provide enhanced features that competitors can’t implement with our dexterity. We’re working to more closely integrate with agent and carrier systems, while providing customer portals for borrowers’ self-service and transparency.

 What does your vision look like over the next 3-5 years for Standard Premium Finance? Where do you want the company to be?

 Looking ahead, we have several key priorities. Uplisting to NASDAQ. We want to increase liquidity for shareholders and visibility in the capital markets. As I mentioned, we want to increase our geographic reach. We also have been looking at synergistic opportunities within the specialty finance space that go beyond insurance premium finance. If we consistently execute, we believe we can grow revenue materially while maintaining strong returns and becoming a go-to partner in the broader financial ecosystem.

 For agents and carriers evaluating premium financing, what should they look for? What separates a strong provider from an average one?

 Good question. I would say that service, transparency, technology, financial stability and incentives are characteristics that separate a top tier provider from the rest. You want a financing partner that can provide clarity on costs, fees, interest and business retention. The technological capabilities of your premium financing partner can be the difference between agents capturing a renewal or losing it to a competitor. You also want a provider that shares a sense of partnership. That usually signals better long-term value. I believe Standard Premium Finance delivers on all these metrics. And our longstanding business relationships would confirm that.

 What keeps you motivated as you lead the company, especially in today’s competitive and fast-changing financial environment?

 For me, it’s seeing firsthand how what we do helps people, the agents, carriers, customers. We help manage cash flows, protect assets and provide policyholders access to coverage without breaking the bank upfront. I also enjoy the challenge of building something enduring. Specialty finance is extremely competitive. It’s exhilarating to keep improving, take on calculated risks, learn from mistakes, but focusing on scaling what works.

 And, of course, the team at Standard Premium Finance is doing excellent work. Our employees stick with us because we stick with them. We have a great lineup with a depth of knowledge in our industry. Our dedication shows how we evolve, how we deliver service and how we respond to market dynamics.

 Finally, I see you’re headquartered in Miami. What’s it like running your company from there?

 Miami is a great place to do business, which has its own unique culture and energy. It’s a diverse, dynamic market with a strong financial services presence and a lot of entrepreneurial energy. The city has become a hub for innovation, and we benefit from that ecosystem. The city has also become a true financial hub, with access to talent, capital and a growing network of financial and insurance professionals. And I’ll add: Go Canes! I’m a lifelong fan. Just like the Canes, we play to win, stay disciplined and take pride in representing Miami on a bigger stage.
