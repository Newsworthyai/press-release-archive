# Tommy Mac Custom Furniture Opens First Showroom in Boston’s Financial District

From his North End workshop to Downtown Boston, Tommy Mac brings his collection of rockers, armchairs, stools, and more to 155 Federal Street

 Tommy MacDonald, Boston native and former host of Rough Cut: Woodworking with Tommy Mac on PBS from 2010 through 2016, is proud to announce the opening of his first-ever public showroom at 155 Federal Street in Boston’s Financial District on Thursday, October 16thfrom 10:00 am – 12:00 pm. The new space is a true one-stop shop, featuring his signature collection of rockers, armchairs, kitchen stools, live edge tables, beds, and more – all handcrafted at his North End workshop using the finest North American hardwoods. Nearly every piece on display will be available for purchase.

 With growing demand for locally made, high-quality furniture, MacDonald saw an opportunity to create a space where people could experience his work in person, connect with the craftsmanship behind it, and support Massachusetts-based artists and craftsmen. Alongside the Tommy Mac Collection, the space will feature additional works from local makers, celebrating the artistry and tradition of Massachusetts design.

 “I was born and raised in Boston, and everything I make carries that spirit. It’s real, built to last, and meant to be lived with,” said Tommy MacDonald. “This showroom is more than a store, it’s a place where people can discover unique pieces, meet the makers behind them, and know that everything they see is made right here in Massachusetts.”

 “Congratulations to Tommy Mac on the opening of this beautiful showroom in the heart of Downtown Boston,” said Michael Nichols, President of the Downtown Boston Alliance. “Tommy joins a community of makers who have chosen Downtown Boston as the place to showcase their workmanship to the millions of people who visit each month. We are fortunate to have his artistry now on view.”

 At the heart of the showroom is the luxury arts-and-crafts-inspired rocker, designed for beauty and comfort and named after Tommy’s mom, Millie, honoring her love of rocking chairs. The tight back rocker offers the most polished look with its attached back cushion and sleek piping, while sequentially matched boards give each rocker its own unique look and feel. The rocker is built using time-tested traditional joinery techniques, including through-mortise wedged tenons and bent-laminated rockers. Each cushion features a nine-spring, eight-tie seat foundation topped with a plush down cushion. Both are upholstered in the finest all-natural fabrics and leathers.

 The collection also includes versatile armchairs with wide functional arms and multiple reclining settings, as well as timeless kitchen stools crafted with single-board seats and wedged tenon joints for comfort and durability. Like the rocker, each piece on display in the showroom is handmade in Massachusetts in limited quantities, ensuring every item is authentic, unique, and built to last.

 Hours of operation are Tuesday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Wednesday and Thursday from 11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., and Friday and Saturday by appointment only. Appointments are encouraged on all days and can be scheduled directly with Tommy by calling 781-856-2210.
