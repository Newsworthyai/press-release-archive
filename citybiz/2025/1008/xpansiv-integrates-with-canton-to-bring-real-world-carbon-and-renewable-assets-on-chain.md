# Xpansiv Integrates With Canton to Bring Real-World Carbon and Renewable Assets On-Chain

Xpansiv, the leading infrastructure provider for the global energy transition markets, today announced a phased initiative to enable the tokenization of environmental assets and their performance data on the Canton Network, an institutional-grade blockchain for regulated financial markets.

 As institutional markets increasingly embrace tokenization, Xpansiv is advancing its infrastructure to support asset-level data authentication, issuance, and performance-linked financial instruments. This initiative lays the foundation for scalable, compliant, and interoperable solutions across the energy transition economy.

 The initiative will begin with a pilot program to enhance Xpansiv’s existing database of standardized, immutable digital identifiers—including those covering real-world, utility-grade, renewable energy generation assets—into identifiers compatible with the Canton Network. This process will leverage the SMART Protocol to support secure, permissioned data sharing across platforms, demonstrating how authenticated asset-level data can support performance-linked financing and new financial products, all with auditable reporting.

 “Trillions of dollars are required to finance the energy transition, and tokenization presents a significant emerging pathway for capital deployment,” said John Melby, CEO of Xpansiv. “By linking our infrastructure to Canton’s institutional-grade blockchain, we’re enabling our customers to pursue new distribution channels and laying the groundwork for trusted, interoperable transition finance.”

 “Xpansiv’s initiative is a pivotal step toward uniting trusted real-world data with the on-chain institutional finance ecosystem,” said Yuval Rooz, CEO of Digital Asset, creator of the Canton Network. “This evolution not only enhances integrity by anchoring physical assets on-chain, but also opens the door to a new era of scalable, performance-linked financing and trusted tokenized asset data that will transform how global markets operate.”

 To support this initiative, Xpansiv is collaborating with Fiùtur, a DLT-native infrastructure company. Fiùtur’s SMART Protocol will be used to create and manage asset and performance tokens via Smart IDs, ensuring compatibility with the Canton Network’s privacy-preserving architecture.
