# Luxury Health &amp; Wellness Destination Monarch Athletic Club to Launch First East Coast Location at The RIVANI Miami Beach

Robert Rivani, Founder of RIVANI, announced today that Monarch Athletic Club, the physician-led wellness destination redefining health and wellness, will open an 8,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art wellness facility at The RIVANI Miami Beach, his flagship Class X office building located at 1691 Michigan Avenue. This marks Monarch Athletic Club’s first expansion outside of Los Angeles, where the concept has cultivated a devoted following of health-conscious executives, athletes, and entrepreneurs.

 “Expanding Monarch into Miami is a milestone that excites our entire team. Southern California has been the proving ground for our model — where people value innovation and high performance — but Miami brings a unique energy and an unmatched appetite for community, wellness, and longevity,” said Dr. Ryan Greene, DO, MS – Co-Founder & Medical Director, Monarch Athletic Club. “The culture in Miami is vibrant, global, and deeply connected to health and vitality. It’s the perfect place to expand our ecosystem and introduce more people to a model of care that keeps them well, strong, and thriving. We’re thrilled to build something special here and contribute to Miami’s growing identity as a destination for proactive health and performance.”

 “Monarch Athletic Club is a game changer for Miami’s wellness scene,” said Robert Rivani. “Their innovation and elite level of services represents the caliber of tenants we are curating at The RIVANI, and aligns with our vision of a workplace designed around lifestyle and wellbeing. This is the future of office, and arguably the most significant amenity of any South Florida office building.”

 Monarch Athletic Club is redefining health care delivery through a fully integrated model that combines medicine, fitness, and recovery under one roof. Members receive access to a dedicated team of physicians, nurse practitioners, strength coaches, nutritionists, and physical therapists who deliver coordinated, data-driven programs focused on prevention rather than treatment. Each member completes a comprehensive in-house medical evaluation and quarterly follow-ups that include physical therapy, strength, and nutrition assessments to ensure measurable progress and long-term optimization.

 Monarch provides unlimited personal training, physical therapy, IV therapy, concierge longevity medicine, hormone and peptide optimization, and advanced recovery modalities such as ice baths and infrared saunas — all curated to maximize member outcomes and extend healthspan. By uniting these disciplines in one seamless membership experience, Monarch is creating a scalable, next-generation model for proactive, preventative health.

 Founded by Dr. Ryan M. Greene, DO, MS and Paul Freschi, Co-Founder & Director of Performance, Monarch Athletic Club was created to redefine modern wellness through a proactive, performance-driven approach. The brand’s mission is to empower members to take control of their long-term health while optimizing daily performance and longevity to thrive both inside and outside the gym.

 The arrival of Monarch Athletic Club to Miami Beach underscores Rivani’s Class X vision, an entirely new standard of office development that integrates luxury design, cutting-edge technology, and hospitality-level services. Designed by the acclaimed Rockwell Group, The RIVANI Miami Beach embodies the energy and exclusivity of a five-star resort, establishing a new global benchmark for office space.

 Monarch Athletic Club is slated to debut at The RIVANI Miami Beach in 2026. For more information visit: monarchclubs.com and rivani.com.
