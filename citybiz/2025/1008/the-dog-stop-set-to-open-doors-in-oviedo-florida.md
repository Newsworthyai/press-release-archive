# The Dog Stop Set to Open Doors in Oviedo, Florida

The Dog Stop, the all-inclusive and award-winning dog care brand, is excited to announce a new location in Oviedo, Florida. Set to open October 18, the new location will be located at 1370 Oviedo Mall Blvd. To celebrate the new addition to the community, The Dog Stop Oviedo will be hosting a Halloween-themed grand opening celebration on October 25, featuring a dog costume contest, giveaways, and fun activities for Orlando’s dog community.

 The Oviedo location is owned by Justin Steiner, who brings a wealth of experience in business strategy and operations. A Vanderbilt Business School valedictorian, Steiner spent several years as a consultant—first in technology, then in healthcare—before moving to Orlando to join Midtown Consulting and eventually launching his own firm. While he achieved success in the corporate world, he found the environment increasingly focused on politics and quarterly numbers, with less priority placed on building relationships and customer service. Now, Steiner is pursuing a lifelong dream by taking the leap into the pet care industry, returning to the people-first aspect of business that he initially enjoyed.

 Steiner’s decision to join The Dog Stop stems from both his love of dogs and a commitment to raising the standard of pet care. His family includes several rescued greyhounds, all former racing dogs, and he takes pride in helping them adjust to life as pets. After experiencing a negative incident with another boarding facility, Steiner’s philosophy of care is now driven by a deep commitment to safety, quality, and building trust. Beyond his personal passion, Steiner was drawn to The Dog Stop because of its co-founder, Jesse Coslov, who opened the very first location and remains involved in the company to this day.

 “I’ve always been inspired by the unique bond between humans and dogs, and the true partnership that has evolved between us over time,” said Steiner. “I believe that pets are part of the family, and I saw that same philosophy reflected in The Dog Stop. Their team understands what dogs really need and has built a business and approach dedicated entirely to meeting those needs. I want each pet and owner in our community to have a place they can trust completely, where safety and happiness come first, and I look forward to providing that to my neighbors.”

 Joining Steiner in this venture is General Manager Shaun Philbrook. Having moved frequently as a child in a military family, Philbrook found a true home in Winter Springs, graduating from the local high school and staying in Central Florida to earn his bachelor’s degree from UCF. Over a 15-year career with the Winter Springs Police Department, he served as a K9 officer and held leadership roles, including Public Information Officer and Lieutenant Detective, gaining extensive expertise in canine behavior, psychology, and physiology. Philbrook’s experience working with dogs in high-pressure environments, combined with his personal love of dogs and deep roots in the community, will allow him to provide the level of care and attention he knows pet parents expect and deserve.

 Spanning 10,000 square feet, The Dog Stop in Oviedo will offer the brand’s full suite of services: luxury boarding accommodations, an interactive and social daycare experience, expert training, spa-like grooming, premium retail, and more. Steiner plans to grow to five locations in the region and is actively seeking rescues to partner with as he plans to host adoption events in their large lobby area.

 “Justin embodies everything we look for in a The Dog Stop owner,” said Coslov. “His passion and love for dogs will ensure he provides the high standard of care we are committed to, and we are excited to watch Central Florida benefit from his dedication and vision.”

 Owned and operated by dog people since 2009, The Dog Stop understands the complex process involved in dog care and knows that there is no such thing as a one size fits all approach. At The Dog Stop, expert staff at each location stay up-to-date on the ever-changing science that applies to dog care, behavior, grooming, and nutrition. A one-stop-shop also offering pet care products and supplies, each item on its shelves is the latest and greatest in its respective category, ensuring that each dog who stops by receives the very best treatment.
