# Ronald McDonald House of Dallas Seeks Volunteers for 38th Annual Trains at NorthPark

As the holiday season approaches, The Ronald McDonald House of Dallas (RMHD) is inviting the North Texas community to help spread the holiday spirit by volunteering at The Trains at NorthPark. Now in its 38th year, this cherished fundraising tradition will return to NorthPark Center on Saturday, November 15, 2025, and run through Sunday, January 4, 2026.

 RMHD is currently recruiting volunteers to support the eight-week exhibit. Volunteers are most needed during the week, and will assist with greeting guests, monitoring the exhibit, selling tickets and merchandise, and helping families create lasting holiday memories.

 Presented by Bank of Texas for the 17th consecutive year, The Trains at NorthPark helps support RMHD’s mission of providing a home-away-from-home for families with children receiving critical medical treatment at Dallas-area hospitals. The tradition aims to raise more than $1.1 million to help RMHD continue this vital work.

 “Volunteers are the heart of this event,” said Jill Cumnock, CEO of Ronald McDonald House of Dallas. Their time and energy help support our mission of keeping families close to the care their children need. Every smiling face and helpful hand at The Trains at NorthPark plays a role in creating the magic that makes this event so meaningful.”

 The event is perfect for individuals, school groups, corporate teams, and families looking for a way to give back during the holiday season. Volunteers must be 15 years or older and can sign up for shifts online through the Trans at NorthPark website: https://trainsatnorthpark.org/volunteer/.

 “Whether you volunteer one shift or come back every week, your presence makes a difference,” said Jane Finan, volunteer services manager at RMHD. “We simply couldn’t make this event happen without our dedicated volunteers who generously give their time to support our families and spread holiday cheer.”

 In addition to volunteer opportunities, The Trains at NorthPark will feature several new attractions this year, including the Art on the Rails auction and Choo-Choo Tales live story-time performances, as well as Sensory Hours made possible by Children’s Health. The exhibit will be located on Level One in NorthPark Center.
