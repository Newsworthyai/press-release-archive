# DealHub Crowned the #1 Salesforce CPQ Alternative by Digital Journal for 2025

In a pivotal moment for revenue operations, the platform DealHub CPQ is being recognized not just as a viable alternative but as the leading pick over Salesforce CPQ. According to the recent review by Digital Journal titled “The 7 Salesforce CPQ Alternatives Redefining Revenue Agility in 2025”, DealHub took the number-one spot, credited for its deep integration of quoting, contracting, and subscription billing under one unified framework. Digital Journal Subsequently, a press announcement by Business Insider reaffirms that ranking and positions DealHub ahead of its competitors.

 This recognition arrives as organizations grapple with the limitations of legacy CPQ tools. As business models shift to subscriptions, usage-based billing, and more digitally driven buyer engagement, the toolset simply must keep pace. The broader market narrative underscores a need for speed, agility, and real-time collaboration across sales and operations.

 The Changing Landscape of Configure-Price-Quote Systems

 Traditional CPQ platforms were often built for static product catalogs and linear sales processes. In contrast, today’s enterprises face complex renewal cycles, multi-year subscriptions, and ever-shifting pricing models. Digital Journal highlights that older platforms frequently struggle to manage these demands effectively, and this creates opportunities for newer solutions that lean into agility and buyer engagement.

 DealHub captures this shift. The review notes that businesses using its platform report reductions in quote generation time of 50 to 70 percent and implementations measured in weeks rather than the quarters typical of older systems. Digital Journal These metrics point to a growing differentiation in the CPQ market between platforms built for change and those designed for the status quo.

 User experience and deployment speed matter. For revenue operations and sales enablement teams, long implementation schedules, heavy reliance on IT and frustration among sellers can all add up to lost deals and revenue leakage. Review data from Gartner Peer Insights shows DealHub’s strong user sentiment, further underscoring its appeal.

 What Sets DealHub Apart

 There are several capabilities that differentiate DealHub in a crowded CPQ market. First, the unified architecture combines quoting, contract lifecycle management (CLM) and subscription billing, all within a single workspace. This data-model unity eliminates many of the integration risks and administrative overhead found in multi-vendor stacks. Digital Journal describes this as central to its “revenue orchestration” approach.

 Second, DealHub emphasizes the buyer experience. Its interactive “DealRoom” environment brings real-time engagement analytics, direct collaboration, and dynamic quote modules that elevate the seller-buyer interaction beyond static documents. This informs better decision-making and faster alignment.

 Third, embedded intelligence drives performance. With real-time pricing recommendations, guidance on deal structure, and automation of approvals, DealHub offers more than configuration; it delivers actionable guidance and operational acceleration. According to product information, the platform supports usage-based and consumption billing, integrates widely with CRMs, and offers adaptive pricing logic.

 This strategic layering of architecture, buyer engagement, and intelligence positions DealHub not simply as an alternative but as a forward-looking solution for organizations striving for revenue agility.

 Implications for Revenue and Sales Teams

 The rise of DealHub signals a shift in how sales and revenue operations functions are equipped and executed. Rather than simply automating quoting, teams are now focusing on orchestration of the full revenue lifecycle, from configuration to renewal. The tools that once served as operational enablers are becoming strategic assets.

 Speed to value matters more than ever. If implementation takes six months or more, businesses risk falling behind in fast-changing markets. Platforms that enable deployment in weeks give organizations a tangible competitive edge. For companies in the Philippines, Southeast Asia, and other emerging markets where scale and agility are essential, this matters especially. The Business Insider release specifically calls out this regional relevance.

 Finally, unified revenue data and buyer-centric workflows help sales teams move from configuration to collaboration. When quoting and contracting live in one environment, hand-offs shrink, approval friction drops, and forecast visibility improves. This allows sales, finance, and operations to act on the same real-time intelligence.

 What to Watch For DealHub

 Having secured top recognition among CPQ alternatives, DealHub is at a pivotal point. Organisations evaluating their revenue stacks must ask whether their quoting-to-cash process can adapt to the cadence the business demands. The benchmark is shifting; legacy CPQ that relies on lengthy customization and slow time to live will increasingly face scrutiny.

 That said, tools only enable transformation; they do not guarantee it. The orchestration of people, process, and governance remains essential. Integration with CRM and ERP, alignment across teams, and adoption by sellers determine success. As we move deeper into 2025, the winners will be those that treat quote-to-cash not as a back-office function but as a revenue engine that is connected, intelligent, and agile. DealHub’s positioning suggests it is well suited for this emerging imperative.
