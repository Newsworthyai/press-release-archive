# Play It Again Sports Celebrates Grand Opening in Saline

Play It Again Sports®, the leading family sporting goods resale concept, has announced the grand opening of its newest location in Saline on November 6. Located at 551 E Michigan Ave, the brand provides athletes of every age a place to sell their quality used sports and fitness equipment including: football equipment, baseball gloves and bats, hockey gear, golf clubs, soccer gear, lacrosse equipment, treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, weights, and more.

 A favorite among families, the new Play It Again Sports in Saline is part of Winmark – the Resale Company®, a unique national retail resale franchise that focuses on sustainability, small business formation and providing Resale for Everyone®.

 Meet the Local Owners

 For Jen and Rick Karcher, opening Play It Again Sports in Saline is a true homecoming rooted in family, community, and a lifelong passion for sports. Both born and raised in Michigan, the couple returned after a decade in Florida and saw a need for a local sporting goods store that could make athletics more affordable and accessible for families like theirs. As parents of three active kids and longtime Play It Again Sports customers, they know firsthand the value of quality equipment at a fair price. Beyond offering new and gently used gear, the Karchers plan to partner with local teams, host demo days, and provide discounts to encourage more families to get involved in sports.

 “Sports have always been at the heart of our family,” said Jen Karcher. “Between Rick and our son’s experience playing professional baseball and our years spent cheering the kids on from the sidelines, we know what it takes to keep up with an active lifestyle and how valuable it is to have a place like Play It Again Sports that lets families explore new activities without the high cost or pressure of competitive sports.”
