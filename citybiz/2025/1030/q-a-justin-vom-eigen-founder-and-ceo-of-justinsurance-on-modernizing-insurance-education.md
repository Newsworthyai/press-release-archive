# Q&amp;A: Justin vom Eigen, Founder and CEO of JustInsurance, on Modernizing Insurance Education

Justin vom Eigen’s journey from car sales to launching a fast-growing EdTech and InsurTech company is rooted in one goal: to make insurance education accessible, engaging, and effective. As founder and CEO of JustInsurance, he’s transforming the way aspiring agents learn and get licensed, bringing technology, automation, and plain-English teaching to an industry long overdue for change.

 In this Q&A, vom Eigen shares what inspired him to start JustInsurance, how AI is reshaping learning, and why modernizing insurance education is key to the industry’s future.

 Justin, what inspired you to start JustInsurance, and what gap did you see in the insurance education market that others weren’t addressing?

 I kept recruiting talented people who would fail their prelicensing exams or quit halfway through because the courses were ancient and soul-crushing. I started making YouTube videos to actually help people pass, and when thousands started using them, I realized I’d stumbled onto something big. Nobody was teaching insurance like it’s 2025, so I decided to fix it.

 Before launching JustInsurance, you had a career in both car sales and insurance. How did those experiences shape the way you built your company?

 Car sales taught me how people actually make decisions, and that trust is the key to relationships. Insurance taught me how brutal the entry barrier is for new agents. I combined those lessons to build a company that sells confidence and actually gets people across the finish line.

 For readers who aren’t familiar, how does JustInsurance work and what makes your pre-licensing and continuing education courses different from traditional options?

 We’re 100% online, fully interactive, and we actually handle the entire licensing process for students, from scheduling exams to background checks. We make the learning process easier by helping people understand the concepts they’ll be tested on instead of just expecting them to memorize hundreds of definitions. We’re also the first company to build out API integration for our clients so that agencies can plug our courses directly into their systems. Basically, we turned the most boring part of insurance into something that doesn’t make you want to quit your career before it starts.

 You’ve described JustInsurance as both an EdTech and InsurTech company. How are you using technology and AI to improve the learning process for aspiring agents?

 AI touches almost everything we do, from rewriting content at a 4th-grade reading level to creating practice exams that predict actual state exam questions. We use it to build personalized study modules, handle most customer service tickets, and even develop educational games that would’ve taken us years to code manually. The result is that students finish faster, drop out less, and pass at higher rates than any competitor.

 The insurance industry has a reputation for being complex and intimidating. How is JustInsurance making it more accessible and transparent for new professionals?

 We turned insurance jargon into plain English and made sure nobody needs a classroom or a $2,000 budget to get started. Insurance is complex, but we make it simple. We’re basically the friend who explains everything before the test so you actually feel ready. I was always that guy in school and now I can be that guy for the insurance industry.

 What are some of the biggest challenges you’ve faced in modernizing such a traditional industry and how have you overcome them?

 Convincing people that change is worth it is like trying to explain ChatGPT to someone who’s only ever used Google. They don’t realize how broken their system is until they try something new. People in the insurance industry can be very conservative and terrified of trusting a change, but those who innovate will be the ones who survive and thrive. Also, the state approvals were a ridiculously brutal process. If I knew how much effort it would take before I started, I probably wouldn’t have started.

 You have a location in Florida, which is becoming a major hub for innovation and fintech. How has being part of that ecosystem influenced your company’s growth?

 Florida is the perfect storm for us because of its massive insurance market, booming fintech scene, and an energy of “build something.” I started with Florida agents because the sheer volume gave us instant momentum. If I’d launched anywhere else, we’d still be crawling instead of sprinting. I am very fortunate to have been exposed to the entrepreneurial essence at the heart of South Florida because it fueled my passion for growth and helped me push through resistance obstacles.

 How does JustInsurance support career growth beyond licensing, for example, helping agents stay compliant, build confidence, and grow their business long term?

 Licensing is just the start for us. We offer continuing education, business-building tech resources, and eventually help agents launch their own agencies if they want to use our prelicense courses. We’re not a one-night stand; we’re a long-term business partner. Think of us as the career coach you didn’t know you needed.

 What trends are you seeing in the insurance and education sectors that excite you the most right now?

 Education is finally catching up to how people actually learn. It needs to be mobile, personalized, and engaging. In insurance, technology is peeling back the curtain and making everything more transparent. As the industry modernizes, somebody needs to modernize the training so it might as well be us.

 Finally, what’s next for JustInsurance? Are there any upcoming products, partnerships, or expansions that you’re excited to share?

 We’re going national, expanding our course catalog, and building tools that help agents grow their businesses long after they’re licensed. We’re partnering with carriers and agencies who get that better training means better agents. The goal is simple: do our best to help the insurance education space as much as possible and make it a no-brainer to use us for insurance license education.
