# Hancock Health and Arrive AI Introduce Robotic Delivery Program at Hancock Regional Hospital

Arrive AI (NASDAQ:ARAI), a pioneering autonomous delivery network anchored by patented AI-powered Arrive Points, and Hancock Health, a regional hospital and member of the Mayo Clinic Care Network located in Greenfield, IN, today announced the launch of a two-year partnership. The agreement marks Arrive AI’s first revenue generating deployment. The collaboration will explore the transformative potential of asynchronous robotic automation for medical deliveries within hospitals, aiming to unlock significant cost savings through technological advancements and operational efficiencies using Arrive AI technology.

 Operations began today with the Arrive Point, as Arrive AI’s secure and patented autonomous delivery station took center stage. This innovative device will serve as a reliable, chain-of-custody-compliant hub for the seamless drop-off and pickup of biospecimens from the cancer center.

 This partnership places Hancock Health at the forefront of autonomous medical logistics, with potential applications across its broader network of more than 30 locations in East Central Indiana.

 “At Hancock Health, our top priority is delivering personalized and high-quality care in the most affordable and efficient way possible,” said Steve Long, President and CEO of Hancock Health. “Embracing automation opens the door to transformative improvements – reducing costs, accelerating the delivery of critical items like test results, medications, and lab specimens, and strengthening the security and reliability of our services. Every improvement in these areas enhances the overall patient experience.”

 Dan O’Toole, CEO of Arrive AI, commented, “This live deployment marks a significant milestone for Arrive AI as we move from pilot programs to generating revenue and demonstrating the real-world value of our autonomous delivery solutions. We are eager to collaborate closely with Hancock Health and validate the tangible benefits Arrive AI will bring to their operations.”

 Hancock Health has identified operational inefficiencies that include having medical personnel make more than a dozen daily trips between its clinics and hospital lab to deliver specimens. Those trips pull staff from critical duties, delay lab results and increase labor costs. The multi-phase test with Arrive AI will showcase how cutting edge, asynchronous technology is set to change the healthcare landscape in a seismic way.

 The phased rollout of the initiative includes: a comprehensive readiness evaluation; the installation of robotic technology at the hospital’s Sue Ann Wortman Cancer Center and laboratory; the development of optimized delivery routes; the expansion of technology deployment to off-campus locations; and the introduction of drone-based transport for time-sensitive and off-site medical deliveries. Each phase will incorporate the Arrive Point, providing a standardized and secure interface for all chain-of-custody transfers.

 According to the terms of the agreement, Arrive AI anticipates leveraging the insights gained from this trial by September 2027 to develop a scalable framework for integrating ground robotics, courier networks, and drones across Hancock Health’s entire network. Arrive AI will spearhead the design, deployment, and optimization of this integrated system, ensuring regulatory compliance, operational feasibility, and a validated return on investment. Key strategies for enhancing efficiency and reliability include:

 * Replacing manual specimen transport with robotic automation.
* Providing Arrive Point storage devices for round-the-clock deliveries.
* Deploying drones for urgent and off-campus transport needs.
