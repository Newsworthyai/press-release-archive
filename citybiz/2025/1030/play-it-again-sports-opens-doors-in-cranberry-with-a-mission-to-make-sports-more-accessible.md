# Play It Again Sports Opens Doors in Cranberry with a Mission to Make Sports More Accessible

Play It Again Sports®, the leading family sporting goods resale concept, has announced the grand opening of its location in Cranberry located at 19097 Perry Hwy. The brand provides athletes of every age a place to sell their quality used sports and fitness equipment including: football equipment, baseball gloves and bats, hockey gear, golf clubs, soccer gear, lacrosse equipment, treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, weights, and more.

 A favorite among families, the new Play It Again Sports in Cranberry opened in September to buy, sell and trade quality used sports and fitness equipment. Play It Again Sports is part of Winmark – the Resale Company®, a unique national retail resale franchise that focuses on sustainability, small business formation and providing Resale for Everyone®.

 Meet the Local Owners

 The new store is owned and operated by local husband and wife duo Aaron and Rebecca Jaynes. As parents of a 10-year-old son who has tried nearly every sport, they found themselves constantly buying expensive gear he only used for a short time. First it was hockey, then baseball, and later lacrosse. By the time their daughter started playing soccer, they knew there had to be a better way. During a visit to Ohio, they stopped by Play It Again Sports and were able to find everything they needed at a reasonable price. That experience inspired them to bring the concept to their own community.

 Beyond making sporting gear more accessible, the Jaynes’ also saw a clear opportunity to bring Play It Again Sports to North Pittsburgh. The city is passionate about sports at every level, from professional teams to youth leagues. With strong community support for athletics and many universities and school districts nearby, opening a Play It Again Sports in the area felt like a natural fit.

 “Every kid deserves the chance to play sports, but the cost of youth sports equipment can sometimes limit opportunities,” said Rebecca Jaynes. “With this new store, we hope to eliminate cost as a barrier so more kids can try new activities and discover the sports they love.”
