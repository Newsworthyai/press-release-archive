# 180 Turning Lives Around Receives $20,000 Grant to Combat Domestic Violence Against Women from Mary Kay Ash Foundation

180 Turning Lives Around has been awarded a $20,000 grant from the Mary Kay Ash Foundation® to support survivors of domestic violence in Monmouth County. The grant is part of the Foundation’s national effort to invest $1 million in unrestricted funding to 50 domestic violence shelters across the country during Domestic Violence Awareness Month.

 This funding will help sustain 180’s Safe House, a 45-bed, 17,000-square-foot emergency shelter that provides safety, stability, and comprehensive wraparound care for individuals and families fleeing abuse. The facility accommodates adult women and men, children, pets, and survivors with physical disabilities, ensuring that every individual seeking refuge has access to the care and compassion they deserve.

 “Our Safe House is one of our most vital emergency response and empowerment programs. It’s a place where concern and despair give way to confidence and determination, and where survivors begin their journey to becoming thrivers,” said Liz Graham, CEO of 180 Turning Lives Around. “We are deeply grateful to the Mary Kay Ash Foundation for recognizing and supporting this life-saving work.”

 Since its founding in 1996, the Mary Kay Ash Foundation has been dedicated to supporting issues that impact women and their families. In 2000, the Foundation expanded its mission to include the prevention and ending of domestic violence. Through its annual shelter grant program, now totaling over $57 million in investments, the Foundation supports the critical work of women’s shelters nationwide, including emergency housing, transitional services, counseling, and legal advocacy.

 More than 300 organizations applied for the Mary Kay Ash Foundation’s shelter grants. 180 Turning Lives Around is honored to be among the 50 recipients nationwide.

 For nearly 50 years, 180 Turning Lives Around has provided safety, support, and hope to survivors of domestic and sexual violence throughout Monmouth County. The organization’s programs include emergency shelter, crisis counseling, court and advocacy services, art therapy for children, and a 24/7 confidential hotline.
