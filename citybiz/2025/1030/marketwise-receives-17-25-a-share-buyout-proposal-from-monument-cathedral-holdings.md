# MarketWise Receives $17.25-a-Share Buyout Proposal From Monument &amp; Cathedral Holdings

MarketWise on Wednesday received an unsolicited takeover proposal from Monument & Cathedral Holdings LLC to acquire the shares it doesn’t already own for $17.25 a share in cash.

 The offer, made through M&C and its affiliates, would include all outstanding equity interests of both MarketWise Inc. and MarketWise LLC not already held by the bidder. The proposal is contingent on the termination of MarketWise’s tax receivable agreement.

 MarketWise, a Baltimore-based provider of subscription-based financial research and investor education tools, said its board is reviewing the proposal with its financial and legal advisers.

 The company emphasized that the approach may or may not lead to a transaction and said it doesn’t intend to provide further updates unless it enters a definitive agreement or is otherwise required by U.S. securities laws.

 Founded in 1999, MarketWise operates a portfolio of investment research and analysis brands that serve self-directed investors seeking market insights, trading strategies, and portfolio tools. Its properties include well-known financial newsletters and digital platforms catering to both retail and professional audiences. The company generates revenue primarily through paid subscriptions, premium memberships, and software tools that help investors navigate financial markets.

 MarketWise went public in 2021 through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company, marking one of the few digital content firms to list via a SPAC at the time. Since then, it has focused on expanding its multi-brand platform, deepening customer engagement, and diversifying its offerings beyond newsletters into education and data-driven investment tools. Shares of MarketWise trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker MKTW.
