# EverDriven Sees 94% Surge in New Business as Demand for Modern Student Transportation Accelerates Nationwide

Broad national adoption in new markets, new regulations for safety, and charter school growth highlight how alternative student transportation solutions are expanding access for diverse student populations

 EverDriven, the nation’s leader in Modern Student Transportation, today announced significant momentum for fiscal year 2025, marked by a 94% year-over-year increase in new business growth. This surge reflects a nationwide shift as school districts adopt alternative transportation solutions, signaling a growing commitment to modern, flexible systems that ensure every student can get to school safely and reliably.

 A notable area of impact for this shift is the charter school sector. Across the country, charter school enrollment continues to climb, with 84% of states experiencing charter enrollment growth that exceeds school-aged population growth, reflecting a growing movement toward educational choice and personalized learning environments. As families seek more tailored academic experiences, districts are responding with transportation models that match that flexibility. EverDriven is seeing this shift firsthand, with charter school partnerships increasing 31% from FY24 and FY25 and an astounding 173% over the past two years. This momentum highlights how alternative transportation is becoming a critical enabler of access and equity in the charter sector.

 “Districts are facing a perfect storm of challenges,” said EverDriven CEO Mitch Bowling. “From rising numbers of students experiencing housing instability or with special education requirements, to rapid charter school growth and new state regulations—schools are rethinking how they ensure every student’s transportation needs are met. EverDriven’s human-led, tech-enabled model is helping districts modernize quickly, while keeping equity and safety at the forefront.”

 Safety remains EverDriven’s highest priority and a key differentiator in its growth. According to the company’s Future of Modern Student Transportation and Safety Report, EverDriven safely transported more than 31,000 students over 33 million miles last year, achieving a 99.99 percent safety record. Since its inception, the company has completed over 12 million trips spanning 180 million miles with 100 percent compliance with state and federal safety standards. In addition, more than 70 percent of students with disabilities are paired with the same driver throughout the school year — a model that builds trust, consistency, and stability for the nation’s most vulnerable students.

 That same focus on safety guided EverDriven’s early response to California’s Senate Bill 88 (SB88). Rather than waiting for the July 2025 deadline, the company completed all necessary compliance work six months in advance, adhering to enhanced safety protocols, driver training requirements, and vehicle maintenance regulations. The systems developed to meet SB88 weren’t confined to California, as they’ve been integrated across EverDriven’s national operations to ensure every district benefits from the same elevated safety standards.

 EverDriven has witnessed this need for safety and transparency translate into action as new districts from across the country continue to come on board, including prominent districts in California, Ohio, Texas, Illinois, Wisconsin, Florida and Arizona, among others.

 “EverDriven took the guesswork out of SB88 compliance. Their expert team ensures drivers, vehicles, and reporting are fully aligned with the new regulations. Honestly, their practices have long been the safest in the business. Long before any legislative requirements, EverDriven has had a longstanding reputation of providing safe, student-centered alternative transportation. Their proactive approach gave us confidence that we were fully compliant—long before the deadline,” Carlos Chicas, Executive Director, Maintenance, Operations, Transportation, Capistrano Unified School District.

 EverDriven now supports more than 800 school districts across 36 states, safely transporting 32,641 students to and from school. As demand continues to rise, the company is focused on scaling its impact—bringing modern, student-centered transportation to more communities nationwide. With new districts joining weekly, EverDriven is helping shape the future of student transportation and ensuring that every student, regardless of circumstance, has a safe and reliable way to get to school.
