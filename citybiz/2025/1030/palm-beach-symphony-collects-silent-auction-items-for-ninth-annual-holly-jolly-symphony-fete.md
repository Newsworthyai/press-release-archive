 Get ready to bid on phenomenal experiences and luxury goods during a holiday shopping spree at Palm Beach Symphony’s Ninth Annual Holly Jolly Symphony Fête. This year’s silent auction promises to be bigger and better than ever thanks to the generous donations of attendees at the gift-gathering party held at Palm Beach Design Masters.

 More than 50 guests brought at least one silent auction item, including musical instruments, to the gift-gathering party that was graciously sponsored by Holly Jolly chairs Mary and Will Demory and Palm Beach Design Masters and hosted by Holly Jolly honorary chairs Carol and Thomas Bruce, vice chairs Dr. Martha Rodriguez and Dr. Jesus Perez-Mendez, and auction chair Marietta Muiña McNulty. Designers Joy Jalaeikhoo and Carl Vasile lent their unmatched talents for design and décor to set the scene at the beautifully and festively decorated studio in Palm Beach.

 Donations ranged from gift cards and certificates, fine jewelry, home décor and boutique treasures, dining experiences, wine and spirits, luxury eyewear, paintings and other artworks, and designer travel handbags and accessories to distinctive items for children, women, and men. Each item will be elegantly displayed on the silent auction tables at the Ninth Annual Holly Jolly Symphony Fête, creating a festive holiday shopping experience for guests to discover unique treasures while supporting Palm Beach Symphony’s mission.
