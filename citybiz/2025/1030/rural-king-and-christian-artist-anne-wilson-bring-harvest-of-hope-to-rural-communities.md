# Rural King and Christian Artist Anne Wilson Bring Harvest of Hope to Rural Communities

Rural King, a family-owned retailer dedicated to the rural lifestyle, is partnering with platinum-certified, Grammy-nominated artist and songwriter Anne Wilson for the “Harvest of Hope: On the Road” tour, a family-friendly concert series celebrating faith, family and community across rural America.

 As part of the Rural King Foundation’s annual Harvest of Hope: On the Road initiative, Wilson will perform and meet fans at three Rural King locations this fall:

 * Nov. 5 – Dothan, Alabama, at 3:30 p.m.
* Nov. 22 – Cross Lanes, West Virginia, at 1 p.m.
* Dec. 10 – Waverly, Ohio, time TBA

 “Rural King is proud to partner with Anne Wilson, whose music embodies the same values of faith, family and community that we hold close to our hearts,” said Amy Shafer, foundation director for Rural King. “Together, we’re uplifting rural America through music and shared purpose.”

 “I’m honored to join forces with Rural King to bring Harvest of Hope to life in local communities,” Wilson said. “These events are about more than music. They’re about bringing people together to celebrate what matters most.”

 Each stop will feature a one-hour performance and community gathering designed to inspire hope, connection and service. The Harvest of Hope: On the Road initiative supports local causes and brings families together through meaningful experiences. All events are free to the public.

 Fans can follow the journey and share their experiences using #HarvestOfHope and #RuralKingFamily.

 With a legacy spanning more than six decades, Rural King continues to build strong community connections through local partnerships and events that celebrate the values of rural America.

 About Anne Wilson Anne Wilson makes music where faith and country meet—a rare space where honesty, grief and hope live side by side. At just 23, she has already crossed the 2 billion streams milestone and emerged as one of the most distinctive new voices in both Christian and country music.

 Her third studio album, Stars, captures a young artist growing up on record. Shaped by the tragic loss of her brother Jacob, Wilson’s faith could have been shattered, but instead it was strengthened. That tension—wrestling with God yet still loving Jesus—defines her music and makes her profoundly relatable. “Faith isn’t about never questioning,” she says. “It’s about holding on in the middle of the storm.”

 Stars threads together themes of grief, growth, maturity and wonder, carried by Wilson’s soaring vocals and country-pop production. From the wide-eyed imagery of the title track to the raw prayer of “Carry Me” and the redemption arc of “Dead in the Water,” the album reflects both the hardship of loss and the joy of new perspective.

 Alongside the album, Wilson will deliver her new music to fans in person on The Stars Tour. She’s also recently released a 40-day Hey Girl Devotional, aimed at young readers and extending her message of identity and Christ-centered hope beyond the stage.
