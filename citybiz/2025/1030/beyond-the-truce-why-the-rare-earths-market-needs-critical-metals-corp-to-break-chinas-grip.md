# Beyond the Truce: Why the Rare Earths Market Needs Critical Metals Corp to Break China’s Grip

In a whirlwind summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, the two superpowers struck a fragile deal: China will delay new export controls on rare earth elements (REEs) for one year. Make no mistake, this is a short-term band-aid on a gaping wound in global supply chains. With China controlling nearly 90% of the REE market, the world cannot afford to bet its future on Beijing’s goodwill. Enter Critical Metals Corp (NASDAQ: CRML), whose Tanbreez project in Greenland is emerging as a beacon for Western independence.

 Rare earths, which are17 chemically similar elements like neodymium, dysprosium, and terbium, are the invisible backbone of modern life. They power cars, wind robotics, smartphones, and missile guidance systems and so much more. Demand is exploding: the IEA projects a quadrupling by 2040 amid the green energy boom and prices remain volatile fueled by supply fears.

 China’s Iron Fist: A Weaponized Monopoly Beijing’s dominance isn’t accidental, it’s state-orchestrated. In October 2025, China slapped stricter export controls on REEs and magnets, targeting U.S. defense chains. This follows years of “rare earth diplomacy,” like the 2010 Japan embargo. The recent truce pauses escalation, but existing restrictions stay, and history shows China wields supply as leverage.

 The Tanbreez Project – A Game-Changer for the Western REE Supply Chain Critical Metals Corp and its Tanbreez Project in Greenland are working to be the solution for the West’s REE independence. Tanbreez is one of the world’s largest undeveloped REE deposits: 4.7 billion metric tons rich in heavy rare earth oxides (HREOs) like dysprosium and terbium—critical for high-performance magnets China hoards.

 Key highlights:

 * Advanced stage: Fully permitted, with recent drilling hitting 0.40-0.42% TREO and 26% HREO—top-tier grades with a bankable feasibility study expected to be completed in 2025.
* Offtake secured: 25% of near-term output locked for U.S. buyers, including REalloys, a rare U.S. magnet processor, and Ucore Rare Metals, a leader in rare-and critical-metal resources, extraction, beneficiation, and separation technologies.
* Funding firepower: $85M PIPE raised recently; U.S. Export-Import Bank eyes support.

 Tanbreez is positioned to deliver secure, non-Chinese supply to North America and Europe.

 Forging Western Supply Chains: US and EU Push Back The truce buys time, but long-term security demands homegrown capacity:

 Key Initiatives in the West US:

 * MP Materials expansion; USA Rare Earth magnets.
* Frameworks with Japan/Australia for mining/processing.

 EU:

 * Estonian separation plants; Austrian lithium.
* Critical Raw Materials Act targets 10% global processing by 2030.

 Tanbreez aligns with these initiatives: Greenland’s stability, U.S. alliances, and HREO focus make it ideal.

 The Bottom Line: Act Now or Risk Blackouts The US-China truce is only a temporary pain reliever. True resilience means mining and processing in the US, EU, or allies like Greenland. Critical Metals Corp isn’t your average miner, it’s working at the forefront of supply sovereignty.

 As the U.S. eyes Asia deals, and the West scrambles to shore up its rare earth supply chains: Critical Metals Corp and Tanbreez are the long-term solutions. The rare earths revolution starts here.
