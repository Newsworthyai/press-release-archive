# Innovation Meets Investment: Go Fund Yourself Returns for Season 4 with Patriot Critical Minerals and Opti-Harvest

The hit entrepreneurial series Go Fund Yourself returns for its fourth season on Cheddar TV, continuing its mission to connect startups with investors, buyers, and mentors in front of a national audience. Season 4, Episode 1 airs October 30 at 7pmET on and spotlights two growth-stage companies tackling some of today’s most critical global challenges: securing America’s mineral independence and building a more sustainable agricultural future.

 Building America’s Future from the Ground Up

 Patriot Critical Minerals, based in Nevada, is developing the largest SEC-compliant tungsten resource in the United States. As global supply chains face ongoing volatility, the company’s focus on domestic mining is both timely and strategic. Tungsten is essential to industries ranging from defense and aerospace to clean energy — all sectors where supply chain reliability is directly tied to national security and economic competitiveness.

 “Developing a stable, sustainable source of tungsten within the U.S. isn’t just a business opportunity — it’s a matter of national interest,” said a company spokesperson. Patriot Critical Minerals aims to reduce America’s dependence on foreign imports and create a long-term foundation for advanced manufacturing and renewable-energy applications.

 On Go Fund Yourself, the company presents its case to millions of viewers, including potential investors and government contractors, as part of the show’s growing influence in connecting startups to real capital and strategic partnerships.

 

 Revolutionizing Agriculture with Light

 Sharing the stage this week is Opti-Harvest, a California-based ag-tech innovator pioneering climate-smart farming technology. The company’s patented Opti-Filter system helps farmers harness sunlight more efficiently, boosting crop yields, conserving water, and reducing labor. Their approach combines science and sustainability — using light optimization to transform agricultural productivity amid growing environmental challenges.

 “As climate and labor pressures increase, farmers need solutions that enhance productivity while conserving resources,” said the company’s founder. “Our technology empowers growers to do more with less.”

 Opti-Harvest’s innovations align perfectly with the global push for food security and sustainable farming practices — themes that resonate with institutional investors, sustainability funds, and the show’s environmentally conscious audience.

 A Platform Where Entrepreneurs Meet Investors — Live

 Unlike traditional pitch competitions, Go Fund Yourself combines business with entertainment to create an interactive funding ecosystem. The series airs nationally on Cheddar TV, reaching more than 40 million households through cable, digital, and streaming platforms. Each episode features entrepreneurs pitching their ventures directly to an audience of investors, buyers, and “Titans” — established business leaders who provide mentorship, insight, and occasionally, funding.

 This season’s Titan lineup once again includes:

 * Rory J. Cutaia, creator of Go Fund Yourself, whose vision is to democratize access to capital through interactive media.
* Jayson Waller, serial entrepreneur and award-winning CEO, known for scaling multiple eight-figure companies.
* David Meltzer, investor, author, and motivational business strategist, who brings decades of experience in mentoring high-growth founders.

 Together, they bridge entertainment and enterprise — providing contestants with national visibility and expert mentorship that can translate into real-world partnerships, investor leads, and long-term growth.

 Why the Show Matters

 For emerging companies, Go Fund Yourself offers what few platforms can: instant credibility and exposure. Startups featured on the show gain access not only to Cheddar TV’s expansive audience but also to follow-up investor opportunities, digital engagement campaigns, and media amplification across multiple channels.

 “Go Fund Yourself is more than a show — it’s a launchpad for serious founders ready to scale,” said Cutaia. “Our goal is to connect innovators with the right partners, investors, and customers in real time.”

 Since its debut, the series has attracted entrepreneurs from a wide range of industries, from consumer technology and clean energy to aviation and healthcare. Many alumni have gone on to raise capital through various platforms, leveraging the show’s exposure to accelerate their next growth phase.
