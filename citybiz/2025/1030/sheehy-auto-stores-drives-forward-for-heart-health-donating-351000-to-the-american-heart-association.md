# Sheehy Auto Stores Drives Forward For Heart Health, Donating $351,000 to The American Heart Association

The engines of generosity were in full gear this year as Sheehy Auto Stores announced a $351,000 donation to the American Heart Association (AHA) through its annual “Sheehy Has Heart” campaign.

 Now in its twelfth year, the companywide initiative continues to fuel lifesaving change by raising funds and awareness for cardiovascular research, prevention, and education across the Mid-Atlantic. Since the program’s inception in 2014, Sheehy has contributed more than $3.3 million to support the AHA’s mission of building healthier hearts and longer lives.

 “This campaign provides an opportunity for us to raise awareness for a cause that impacts so many in our communities,” said Vince Sheehy, President of Sheehy Auto Stores. “Each year, our employees, customers, and partners rally together to make a meaningful difference for families affected by heart disease. We’re proud to champion this cause and are committed to advancing the American Heart Association’s lifesaving mission.”

 Throughout the campaign, Sheehy’s 30 dealerships across Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., embraced heart health in various ways—hosting community CPR demonstrations, health screenings, walking challenges, and heart-healthy events. Many employees also participated in AHA programs such as the Greater Washington Region Heart Walk, Go Red for Women, National Walking Day, and #MoveMoreDC, demonstrating Sheehy’s ongoing commitment to hands-on community engagement.

 “The continued dedication of Sheehy Auto Stores is helping save lives,” said Soula Antoniou, Executive Director of the American Heart Association, Greater Washington Region. “Their support funds groundbreaking research, expands education programs, and strengthens local outreach efforts that make a real difference in preventing heart disease and stroke. The ripple effect of their generosity extends far beyond this donation.”

 The annual “Sheehy Has Heart” campaign began as a simple idea—encouraging employees to come together for one shared cause. Over time, it has evolved into a signature community tradition, blending corporate philanthropy, employee engagement, and grassroots participation to advance heart health across every market Sheehy serves.
