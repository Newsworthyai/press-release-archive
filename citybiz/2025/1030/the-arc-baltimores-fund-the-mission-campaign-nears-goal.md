# The Arc Baltimore’s Fund the Mission Campaign Nears Goal

Donations Will Support Programs and Services for People with Developmental Disabilities

 The Arc Baltimore’s Fund the Mission campaign, “From the Foundation to the Future,” is closing in on its goal to raise $75,000. The good news is that there is still time to contribute to the campaign, which honors The Arc’s 75 years of history and will support the vital services The Arc provides for people with developmental disabilities.

 For more than 75 years, The Arc Baltimore has been a powerful force, fighting for a world where every person with an intellectual and developmental disability is valued and included. From its start when four sets of parents envisioned a community that embraced their children, The Arc has grown to ensure that children and adults can pursue their dreams. whether that means college, a career, or a home of their own.

 “The grassroots movement that laid the foundation in 1950 has become a powerful force for change that continues to create a future filled with endless possibilities for people with disabilities,” explains Kathleen McNally Durkin, The Arc Baltimore’s Chief Executive Officer.

 “As a result, today’s children are growing up in a world where inclusion is the expectation, not the exception,” Durkin continues. “Still, our work is not finished. We must ensure every child, adult, and family continues to have the support and opportunities they need not just to survive, but to thrive.”

 Donations to The Arc Baltimore’s Fund the Mission campaign fill the gap not covered by public funding and support essential programs and services provided by The Arc. These include employment training and support, day and residential services, family support and education, treatment foster care, assistive technology services, respite care, and public policy advocacy.
