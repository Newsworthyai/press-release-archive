# State Roundup: Ferguson Refuses To Join National ‘Redistricting Arms Race;’ Moore Could Tap Into Rainy Day Fund For SNAP Recipients As Maryland Joins Lawsuit

FERGUSON REFUSES TO RUN REDISTRICTING SPECIAL SESSION: Two of Maryland’s top Democrats have been eager to jump into the redistricting arms race unfolding across the country and draw boundaries that could oust the state’s lone congressional Republican from office — but the third Democrat needed to run that special session – Senate President Bill Ferguson — has refused. Erin Cox and Katie Shepherd/The Washington Post.

 * In a letter to his fellow Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday, Ferguson said that the decision was made following individual conversations with senators who expressed concerns about national redistricting efforts and pressure to counter Republican-led map changes in other states.

 MOORE COULD TAP RAINY DAY FUND TO AID SNAP RECIPIENTS: Gov. Wes Moore has said he can’t risk dipping into the state’s $3.5 billion cash balance to fund vital food assistance programs that are due to run out of federal money. But the Democratic governor has another option for emergency funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Program, or SNAP: The state’s $2 billion Rainy Day Fund.

 MARYLAND JOINS SUIT AGAINST TRUMP ADMIN OVER SNAP BENEFIT SUSPENSION: Maryland’s attorney general joined 24 other states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday in a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its upcoming suspension of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The lawsuit, filed against the U.S. Department of Agriculture and its secretary, Brooke Rollins, alleges that the temporary defunding of SNAP is unlawful. Mira Beinart of the Capital News Service/Maryland Reporter.

 * Despite holding $6 billion in a reserve fund, USDA said last week it would not process November SNAP benefits without fiscal 2026 funding approved by Congress. The USDA’s refusal to provide November benefits runs contrary to precedent from other recent shutdowns, and even the department’s own Sept. 30 contingency plan that said the contingency fund would be used to continue benefits through the shutdown. Jacob Fischler/Maryland Matters.
* LaMonika Jones of Maryland Hunger Solutions said the USDA’s decision not to tap into contingency funds “will jeopardize millions of Americans across the country, but especially the more than 680,000 Maryland residents who are relying on their benefits to restart in November as well as to carry us through the holidays.” Danielle Brown/Maryland Matters.

 STATE CATTLE FARMERS SAY ARGENTINE IMPORTS WILL HARM U.S. PRODUCERS: Maryland cattle farmers say they would rather see the federal government invest in the American beef producers instead of importing meat from other countries. President Trump recently announced a plan to cut record beef prices by importing from Argentina. Jessica Williamson, a cattle farmer in Allegany County, said that would dramatically hurt beef producers in the United States. Adam Thompson/WJZ-TV News.

 STATE VIOLATES FOUR-DAY-OLD DIRECTIVE ON PLACING FOSTER YOUTH: It took four days for the Department of Human Services to violate its newest directive prohibiting foster children from staying in unlicensed facilities overnight, highlighting the embattled agency’s challenges. Lee O. Sanderlin and Jessica Calefati/The Baltimore Banner.

 MAYOR SCOTT PLEDGES $4.6M TO AID CITY RESIDENTS AMID FED SHUTDOWN: Mayor Brandon Scott announced Tuesday that the city is pledging $4.6 million in aid to some Baltimore residents amid the government shutdown, days ahead of an expected, unprecedented cutoff to federal food aid. Matti Gellman/The Baltimore Banner.

 BA CO COUNCILMAN CALLS FOR INDY PROBE INTO POLICE TRAFFIC STOPS: Baltimore County Councilman Izzy Patoka is calling for an outside investigation into the county’s police department over its traffic stop practices. The Pikesville Democrat — who is running for county executive — demanded transparency in the wake of The Banner’s investigation into how the county’s police department officers stop, search and ticket Black drivers at significantly higher rates than white drivers. Ben Conarck and Céilí Doyle/The Baltimore Banner.

 MO CO PLANNERS RECOMMEND WAYS TO BOOST HOME CONSTRUCTION: Montgomery County planners are recommending policy and regulatory changes to boost construction of multifamily housing as production flounders in the county — with more than 23,000 unbuilt multifamily units awaiting construction, officials said at a County Council meeting Monday. Elia Griffin/Bethesda Today.

 FREDERICK EXEC LAUDS DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION: Diversity and inclusion are the ‘Frederick way’ said County Executive Jessica Fitzwater at Frederick’s annual State of the County Address last night. The county executive said it’s not always easy having hard conversations, and it’s especially difficult seeing eye to eye when someone tells you you’re wrong. Despite this, she says she is still dedicated to meeting with people who think differently. Staff/WYPR-FM.
