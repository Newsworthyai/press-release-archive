# Q&amp;A with Ace Green Recycling CEO Nishchay Chadha: Building a Global Platform for Sustainable Battery Recycling

Nishchay Chadha is Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Ace Green Recycling, a leading battery recycling technology company with global operations across North America, Europe, and Asia. With nearly two decades of experience in metals, mining, and recycling, Chadha has built Ace into one of the only platforms capable of sustainably recycling both lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries. His mission: to create circular supply chain solutions for critical battery materials while advancing zero-emissions recycling technology.

 For readers who are new to Ace Green Recycling, can you give us a quick overview of what the company does?

 Ace Green Recycling is a U.S.-based green recycling technology company providing sustainable, end-of-life solutions for batteries. We’ve developed proprietary technologies to recycle both lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries – including lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) chemistries – through fully electrified processes that produce zero Scope 1 carbon emissions, zero toxic water, and zero solid waste.

 What sets us apart is our modular, scalable design, which allows us to deploy technology across different geographies and create localized circular supply chains. Instead of exporting waste and reimporting refined materials, countries can retain valuable resources domestically – strengthening supply-chain security while cutting emissions.

 What inspired you to start Ace Green Recycling?

 My inspiration was both personal and commercial. After nearly two decades in the metals sector – first at Vedanta Resources, then at Trafigura – I saw how much waste and inefficiency existed in global recycling and mining. In many places, I witnessed unsafe and environmentally harmful practices first hand.

 One experience that stayed with me was a visit to a recycling plant in Vietnam, where children were working in toxic conditions and waste was being dumped into open drains. As a father of two, that moment made me realize I had to be part of the solution. I wanted to prove that recycling could be both profitable and sustainable, built on clean technology and ethical practices.

 At the same time, I saw a gap in the market: there was no global platform combining technology, financing, and risk management to bring structure to what was otherwise a fragmented industry. Ace was founded to solve that challenge.

 Can you tell our readers about Ace’s proprietary technologies and what makes them unique?

 We operate two core technology platforms:

 * GREENLEAD® , our lead-acid recycling process, is fully electric and capable of recovering up to 99% of battery-grade lead with more than 99.98% purity. It replaces legacy smelting – one of the most polluting industrial processes – with a cleaner hydrometallurgical approach that dramatically reduces permitting hurdles and health risks.
* LithiumFirst, our lithium-on recycling process, can recover up to 80% of lithium at >99% purity from LFP batteries, giving us an early -mover advantage as LFP batteries become the dominant chemistry by 2030.

 Both processes operate at room temperature, require no smelting, and use modular, electrified systems that scale faster and at lower cost than traditional recycling plants.

 What is the Grid Metallics Processing System (GMPS), and how does it fit into your platform?

 GMPS is a combined mechanical and chemical innovation that replaces smelting for a large portion of lead-acid batteries. Traditionally, lead paste and grids are processed together in furnaces – an energy-intensive, high-emission approach. GMPS instead separates and individually processes these components using proprietary mechanical and chemical methods that enable clean, efficient separation.

 The recovered metallics are then melted (not smelted) to form battery-grade lead alloy ingots, a necessary step driven by chemistry but performed without the toxic emissions associated with smelting.

 In simple terms, GMPS allows us to recover high-purity lead alloys without smelting furnaces, integrating seamlessly with our GREENLEAD® system to create a fully zero-emission solution for lead-acid battery recycling that’s faster, cleaner, and more cost-efficient than conventional methods.

 You’ve announced development of a facility in Texas, what are your plans for the U.S. market?

 We’re developing a flagship recycling facility in Texas, slated to begin operations in 2026. The site will process both lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries and serve as our model for North American expansion.

 It’s an opportunity to modernize a critical part of the domestic supply chain while supporting the country’s clean energy and electric vehicle goals.

 You’ve also announced partnerships with major companies like Spiro and Glencore. How important are strategic partnerships to your business model?

 Strategic partnerships are central to our business model. We recently announced a partnership with Spiro, Africa’s largest electric vehicle company, which selected Ace as its exclusive global recycling partner. Under this collaboration, we’ll handle both end-of-life lithium-ion batteries and production waste from Spiro’s manufacturing operations, while jointly developing recycling facilities across Africa and other key markets.

 In the U.S., our long-term offtake agreement with Glencore will support materials recovered from our Texas operations, ensuring reliable downstream processing and market access for recycled metals. Feedstock for the Texas facility will primarily come from domestic suppliers, creating a located and fully traceable supply chain.

 More broadly, Ace’s platform monetizes battery recycling through a mix of owned facilities, joint ventures, licensing, and service contracts, giving us flexibility to enter new markets quickly and efficiently.

 What are you most excited about in the coming year?

 We’re entering a pivotal phase for Ace as we move from development to large-scale execution. In the U.S., we’re focused on bringing our Texas facility online and setting a new benchmark for zero-emission battery recycling at scale. Internationally, we’re deploying our licensing model across Armenia, Thailand, and India, helping partners implement clean, modular recycling solutions tailored to their local markets.

 At the same time, we’re scaling up our lithium-ion (LFP) recycling operations in India and expanding our non-smelting lead recycling footprint worldwide, demonstrating that industrial recycling can be both profitable and sustainable without relying on furnaces or toxic emissions.

 What excites me most is proving that there’s a better way to recycle: one that’s safe, scalable, and circular. Every ton of material we recover brings us closer to closing the loop on critical minerals and powering the clean-energy transition responsibly.
