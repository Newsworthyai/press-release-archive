# Flox Raises $25M Series B Led by Addition

Flox, the leading platform enabling unified software lifecycles, today announced a $25 million Series B funding round led by Addition, with participation from NEA, the D. E. Shaw group, Hetz, and Illuminate Financial. The investment will accelerate product development and market expansion as organizations struggle to manage increasingly complex software supply chains.

 AI is generating more code than ever, security vulnerabilities are hiding in mounting complexity, and the current infrastructure is simply not built for this scale. Dependencies break, environments drift, and teams waste countless hours wrestling with setup instead of shipping features.

 Flox solves these problems by making the power of Nix—the open-source technology behind one of the world’s largest package repositories—accessible to engineering teams through an intuitive platform that delivers consistent, portable environments across various operating systems, languages, and architectures.

 “The extreme pressure on engineering teams has made standardized development infrastructure a necessity,” said Ron Efroni, CEO and Co-founder of Flox. “While everyone else is building on top of broken foundations, Flox is strengthening the foundation itself, enabling teams to move faster without sacrificing trust.”

 Strong User Traction Validates Market Need

 Early adopters range from Fortune 5 enterprises to high-growth tech companies like Arcesium, Fellow.ai, Neo4j, PostHog, and Weaviate. These users demonstrate exceptional engagement and drive organic expansion within their organizations, with Flox maintaining 70% retention across a diverse user base spanning individual developers to teams of thousands.

 “Flox takes the friction out of onboarding PostHog team members and contributors. Before, our local dev guide comprised 16 steps with 14 caveats. Now, it’s just a universal `flox activate,`” said Michael Matloka, senior product engineer of PostHog. “Flox keeps the whole team on the same page, no matter how complex our stack gets.”

 “Flox takes the power of Nix and makes it accessible for all,” said Flox Advisor and distinguished engineer, Kelsey Hightower. “That’s why we’re seeing an influx of engagement compared to traditional developer tools, they’re solving the hidden infrastructure crisis every company faces.”

 Strategic Investment Targets Three Critical Areas

 The Series B funding will accelerate innovation across three core initiatives:

 * Universal Development Infrastructure: Building the foundation for cross-OS, cross-architecture, and cross-language compatibility, so teams and agents code consistently without environment friction
* Compliance and Policy Management: Developing automated frameworks and software policies for governance at scale as code volume increases
* Zero-CVE Security Infrastructure: Providing real-time vulnerability detection with comprehensive SBOMs and SLSA compliance for unprecedented visibility into human and AI-generated code

 Flox will also double down on engineering and go-to-market hiring to meet customer demand and expand its enterprise footprint.

 “Flox embodies the foundational transformation required for the next era of AI-driven, reliable software development,” said Todd Arfman, Partner at Addition. “Instead of patching over problems with disconnected solutions, Flox delivers a comprehensive infrastructure platform that gives engineering teams unprecedented control and visibility at the most granular level. This is the kind of deep innovation the industry urgently needs and we are proud to be partnered with the Flox team.”

 Foundation-Level Disruption at Scale

 Since launching Flox 1.0 in March 2024, the company has delivered 40+ releases and introduced major features that operate at the infrastructure foundation including:

 * Molecular-level dependency visibility through a robust 150,000+ package catalog, enabling deterministic environments across systems
* Universal software standardization where every piece of software speaks the same language
* Cross-platform portability with composable environments enabling modular, reusable configurations
* Enterprise automation with native CI/CD integrations for GitHub Actions and CircleCI
* Advanced customization of the entire software catalog while maintaining reproducibility, security, and portability
* Built-in software supply chain security beyond SBOMs with private catalogs and instant rollback through environment generations

 These capabilities enable teams to standardize environments organization-wide, eliminate lengthy onboarding, and recover instantly from configuration failures, addressing pain points that plague traditional container-based approaches.

 Industry Partnerships Expand Platform Reach

 Flox was recently selected as one of a few authorized vendors to distribute prebuilt CUDA binaries, cutting GPU build times from hours to minutes and giving developers instant access to AI infrastructure.

 Additional collaborations include HackerRank, which has integrated Flox to enable repeatable, standardized environments for technical interviews.
