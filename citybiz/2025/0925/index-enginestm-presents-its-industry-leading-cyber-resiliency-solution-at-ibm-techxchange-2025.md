# Index Engines™ Presents its Industry-Leading Cyber Resiliency Solution at IBM TechXchange 2025

Cyber Resilience company Index Engines, today announced it will showcase its proven approach to ensuring data integrity and trusted ransomware recovery at IBM TechXchange 2025, to be held October 6-9 at the Orange County Convention Center and Hilton Orlando.

 CyberSense® underscores how combining immutable snapshots via IBM FlashSystems’ Safeguarded Copy with forensic validation and advanced AI plays an integral role in ensuring a successful cyber resiliency posture—one that supports detection, remediation, and a confident recovery process.

 At the event, Index Engines will highlight how organizations can detect corruption, achieve predictable recovery with reduced reinfection risk while maintaining business continuity with faster RPOs and accelerated restoration times.

 “Immutable storage is a critical building block, but immutability alone cannot ensure recovery,” said Jim McGann, Vice President at Index Engines. “Organizations must be able to recover rapidly, and with confidence. Index Engines and IBM are delivering a practical, validated path to achieve that goal.”

 IBM TechXchange is a technical learning event and community for developers, data scientists, and cybersecurity experts. The conference offers hands-on labs, technical breakout sessions, product demonstrations, and the chance to earn certifications.
