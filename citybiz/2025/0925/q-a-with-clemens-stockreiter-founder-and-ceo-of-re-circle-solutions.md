# Q&amp;A with Clemens Stockreiter, Founder and CEO of RE:CIRCLE Solutions

Clemens Stockreiter is an accomplished international business executive and entrepreneur currently serving as Founder and CEO of RE:CIRCLE Solutions Inc. He brings over two decades of global leadership experience in finance, operations, and business transformation across the paper, packaging, and recycling industries.

 Stockreiter’s career highlights include his work at Mondi, a multinational paper and packaging corporation, where he held various senior positions including business unit CEO and business unit Finance Director. More recently, he served as CEO of PreZero US, PreZero Polymers and held dual CEO/CFO roles at Sky Plastic Group, demonstrating his versatility in leading both established and emerging companies within the circular economy sector.

 What sets RE:Circle apart is that we’re not just diverting waste — we’re repurposing it into new products with measurable nutritional and environmental value.

 He holds a degree in Finance and Financial Markets and Industry from Vienna University of Economics and Business, with specialized expertise in capital market theory and securities valuation. Additionally, he has completed the General Management Program (GMP) at Harvard Business School.

 RE:Circle recently revamped its Ontario facility after acquiring assets from PreZero US. What makes your approach to pre-consumer food waste different from traditional waste management companies?”

 Traditional waste management companies focus on disposal – getting waste from point A to point B and into a landfill or basic composting operation. We’ve fundamentally reimagined that model. Our Ontario facility operates as what I call an industrial nutrition facility, staffed with PhD nutrition scientists who analyze every inbound shipment to determine the optimal feed formulations. Instead of treating organic waste as something to get rid of, we’re extracting maximum nutritional value from pre-consumer food waste before it ever reaches consumers.

 We’re not in the disposal business – we’re in the business of transforming waste streams where possible into high-value animal feed products that provide reliable nutrition for livestock while significantly reducing carbon emissions or feed of anerobic digestion and waste to energy targeting zero waste to landfill.

 “Your TraceOS system promises full traceability for organic waste streams. How does this technology help large retailers and food processors meet California’s SB 1383 requirements, and what kind of emissions reductions are you tracking?”

 TraceOS provides the auditable documentation that California’s SB 1383 requires – complete tracking of inbound and outbound weights, plus real-time calculation of emissions avoided for every shipment. For companies like major retailers, this isn’t just compliance; it’s competitive advantage. They can demonstrate to stakeholders exactly how much waste they’ve diverted from landfills and quantify their carbon impact reduction.

 We track the total emissions avoided for each shipment, giving our clients concrete data for their sustainability reporting – for example, showing them the CO₂-equivalent avoided per ton of diverted waste. This level of transparency and accountability is what separates us from basic waste haulers who can only tell you where your waste went, not what environmental impact you achieved.

 “You’ve described your Ontario operation as ‘much more a nutrition facility’ than a traditional recycling plant. Can you walk us through how your on-site nutrition scientists determine the optimal feed blends from incoming waste streams?”

 Our nutrition scientists review every inbound shipment and analyze the nutritional composition to determine the best possible feed formulations. We’re dealing with constant variability – seasonal differences in produce availability, varying waste streams from different grocery chains and food processors. Our team creates customized blends for cattle, swine, and anaerobic digestion applications based on the specific nutritional profiles of what we receive each day.

 We currently produce two main feed blend types, with several proprietary formulations in development, including liquid blends. It’s precision nutrition applied to waste streams – maximizing the nutritional value while ensuring consistent, high-quality output regardless of input variability. This scientific adaptability allows us to maintain consistency even when supply chains shift.

 With your facility handling 100 tons per day of pre-consumer waste from grocers and food processors, what’s your expansion strategy? What does growth look like for RE:Circle, in California and beyond?

 We’re focused on perfecting our scalable model right here in California before expanding elsewhere. Our Ontario facility was designed with replication in mind – we already have a second depackaging line ready to deploy once we secure the right partnerships.

 The beauty of our approach is that once you have the complete business model, the technology platform, and the scientific expertise, it becomes what I call “copy and paste” scalability. California’s market is substantial enough to support multiple facilities, especially with SB 1383 driving demand. We’re looking at strategic locations that can serve major retail and food processing clusters while maintaining our high-touch, scientific approach to waste transformation.

 How do you see your model contributing to the broader circular economy, and how does it differ from other ‘green’ waste solutions like composting or anaerobic digestion?

 What sets RE:Circle apart is that we’re not just diverting waste — we’re repurposing it into new products with measurable nutritional and environmental value. Composting and anaerobic digestion are valuable tools, but they’re often the “end of the line” for waste streams.

 Our model keeps organic resources in play at their highest possible value, creating precision feed blends that directly reduce the need for traditional agricultural inputs. By doing so, we cut emissions on two fronts: preventing methane from landfills and displacing carbon-intensive feed production. That’s the essence of a circular economy — not just recycling, but regenerating value at every step.

 For companies like major retailers who are rethinking their sustainability strategies, what’s the business case for partnering with RE:Circle versus sending organic waste to traditional composting or landfill diversion?

 The difference is value creation versus cost management. Traditional waste management treats your organic waste as a cost center – you pay to have it hauled away and hope it gets composted properly. We transform your waste into a revenue-generating asset while delivering superior environmental outcomes.

 Our clients get complete traceability through TraceOS, quantifiable emissions reductions, and the ability to demonstrate they’re creating high-value products from their waste streams. For companies facing increasing scrutiny on sustainability commitments, partnering with us means they can tell a story about innovation and circular economy leadership, not just basic compliance. Plus, our scientific approach ensures maximum environmental benefit per ton of waste processed.
