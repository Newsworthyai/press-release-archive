# AFC Planning Group Joins Osaic From LPL Financial With $110 Million in Client Assets

Osaic, Inc., one of the nation’s largest providers of wealth management solutions, today announced the affiliation of AFC Planning Group, a two-person advisory team established in 2008 in Melville, N.Y. Managing partners Lou Addesso and Frank Fattizzi oversee approximately $110 million in assets under advisement. Previously affiliated with LPL Financial, the firm joins Affiliated Advisors, an Osaic office of supervisory jurisdiction (OSJ).

 “At AFC Planning Group, we’ve built a culture rooted in integrity, responsiveness and genuine care. It’s not about transactions – it’s about long-term relationships,” said Addesso. “That mindset shapes every interaction, plan and recommendation we make, including our choice to join Affiliated Advisors and the Osaic community.”

 AFC Planning Group specializes in serving high-net-worth individuals and small to mid-sized businesses. The decision to join Osaic was driven by the firm’s desire for stronger tools and support. Their emphasis on clear communication, proactive service and a consultative approach aligns closely with Osaic’s advisor-focused culture and people-first experience.

“Partnering with AFC Planning Group is a natural fit, and we’re proud to collaborate with a team that shares our client-first values,” said Kristen Kimmell, executive vice president of business development at Osaic. “By tapping into Osaic’s platform, Lou and Frank are positioned to create even greater time and efficiency for their clients. Their future is bright, and we’re honored to be part of it.”

 At Osaic, independence is not only respected but also empowered. The firm provides resources that help advisors grow, increase efficiency and focus more time on clients. They continue to attract leading firms across the industry, including others choosing to make the transition from LPL Financial to Osaic; such as Simplified Wealth Management and Strategic Financial Management.
