# OTR Solutions Launches Innovative Fuel Credit Solution with the OTR Fuel Card

— OTR Solutions transforms access to fuel credit for carriers nationwide by removing credit checks and upfront barriers —

 Today OTR Solutions, a full-service freight factoring and transportation technology company, announced the launch of its new fuel credit offering, the OTR Fuel Card. This offer provides both new and established carriers with reliable access to credit backed by their factoring relationship, not their credit score. The factoring integration ensures carriers can fuel today and pay later through flexible weekly billing or directly through factored invoices.

 “At OTR Solutions, our mission has and always will be to put carriers first,” said Jimmy Wittpenn, Vice President of Fuel Product. “Our new fuel credit offering is just another way we are delivering on that promise. Whether you’re a brand new authority or a seasoned fleet, you now have access to the credit, fuel savings, and support you need to grow your business and be successful.”

 OTR has eliminated the long-standing barriers that once stood between carriers and fuel credit, introducing a self-backed fuel credit offering to the market that leverages factored receivables to reliably extend credit to virtually any carrier, including those with zero credit or operating history, without requiring upfront deposits. OTR expects this new offering to serve as a lifeline to over-the-road carrier operations in a market that has been working against them for years.

 The credit offering is built into the OTR Fuel Card, a long-trusted discount fuel card sold by OTR that provides some of the industry’s deepest discounts on commercial diesel, the largest savings on maintenance, and integrated features and service offerings with the company’s suite of transportation-focused solutions. Every carrier looking to take advantage of the OTR Fuel Card will now be automatically evaluated for a credit line, as the service requires no hard credit checks nor multi-day reviews to issue approval.

 “For too long, a large subset of freight carriers has been overlooked by the outdated and rigid fuel credit providers in the transportation space,” continued Wittpenn. “Critical financing services that our nation’s carriers need to survive have been withheld from those who need them most, and that industry challenge now has a solution through our new product offering.”

 Expanded access to fuel credit is just one of the many advantages the OTR Fuel Card now has over competing discount fuel cards. It redefines the rules of who qualifies and how credit works in the trucking industry. It also creates a unique opportunity for carriers in the industry with:

 * No credit checks
* Eligibility for all carriers who factor with OTR Solutions, both new and existing
* Self-backed Model: OTR directly funds and approves carriers, not a third-party bank
* Cashflow Flexibility: Fuel now, pay later
* Weekly billing that eliminates the hassle of making multiple payments each week

 The launch of fuel credit with OTR is more than just another fuel card enhancement. It’s a step toward reshaping how carriers manage their cash flow. By eliminating outdated barriers to credit, the OTR Fuel Card is leveling the playing field and giving new authorities the ability to compete with established fleets from day one.

 With OTR Solutions Factoring and the OTR Fuel Card, carriers can start fueling on credit immediately after approval, including the fuel needed to pick up their first load.
