# Expert Panel on NYC Luxury Real Estate at THE 74

Last week, Elad Group brought together leading minds in real estate and wealth management for an inspiring panel discussion in a spectacular full-floor residence at THE 74 on the Upper East Side. The event was framed by breathtaking horizontal Central Park views— a fitting backdrop for a spirited and insightful conversation about the city’s enduring appeal.

 Moderator Kael Goodman (CEO of real estate data platform Marketproof) guided a dynamic discussion among prominent experts:

 * Susan de França, President & CEO, Douglas Elliman Development Marketing
* Richard Ferrari, President & CEO, Brokerage for Douglas Elliman’s NYC & Northeast Region
* Robert Gilman, Wealth Partner, Managing Director at JP Morgan

 These voices shared real-time market data, personal insights, and on-the-ground trends, equipping VIP residential agents with powerful talking points to energize client conversations this fall.

 Key Highlights:

 * Panelists agreed that Manhattan’s ultra-luxury real estate market is more than resilient— it’s ascendant.
* Experts pointed to a steady erosion of new development inventory, especially for larger apartments, making turnkey luxury residences like those at THE 74 highly desirable for high-net-worth buyers and multi-generational families.
* A critical takeaway: there aren’t enough four-bedroom-plus condominiums to meet growing demand, highlighting the scarcity of prime product in coveted neighborhoods.
* Ferrari and de França highlighted the Upper East Side’s evolving appeal, blending an iconic lifestyle with fresh restaurants, private clubs, and wellness amenities.
* Gilman discussed real estate’s vital role in wealth planning and transfer strategies, noting buyers’ urgency amid anticipated tax law and mortgage rate changes.
* Throughout, the panel emphasized the exceptional “15-minute city” lifestyle, privacy, and wellness focus available at THE 74— trends fueling the current market momentum.

 Atmosphere & Experience: The evening’s lively discussion took place against dramatic Central Park vistas, with agents enjoying light refreshments and networking before and after the session. Sales and marketing teams offered tours of the residence and shared insights on THE 74’s unique luxury lifestyle and Upper East Side location.
