# Go Fund Yourself Episode 8 Showcases Startups Turning Personal Journeys Into Scalable Ventures

Episode 8 of Cheddar TV’s Go Fund Yourself underscores why the series is attracting growing attention from both entrepreneurs and investors. The latest installment introduced two ventures—French With an Attitude and Torques—that are blending deeply personal narratives with ambitious business models.

 Unlike traditional pitch shows, Go Fund Yourself pairs founders with three seasoned Titans—Rory Cutaia, Jayson Waller, and David Meltzer—who combine sharp market analysis with mentorship. Their candid feedback, ranging from revenue strategy to brand positioning, has become a hallmark of the program and a differentiator for founders looking to accelerate growth.

 

 A Memoir That Doubles as a Movement

 French With an Attitude entered the spotlight with Born in the Wrong Chair, a memoir that tackles cultural displacement, late-diagnosed neurodivergence, addiction, and recovery. More than a life story, the book serves as a framework for transformation, introducing readers to The Three Stages of Awareness: Knowing, Awareness, and Acting.

 What elevates the project from publishing to scalable venture is its connection to Neurodivergent With Attitude, a nonprofit creating adaptive fashion, technology, and educational resources. By integrating content, community, and cause, the initiative appeals to readers, partners, and investors seeking measurable social impact.

 Reimagining Play for Wellness

 The second company, Torques, positions itself at the crossroads of recreation and therapy. Founded by Scott Thomas Peterson, LCSW, the brand reinterprets familiar activities into structured wellness tools. Racquet Torques blends tennis and badminton, while Torques Toss offers gamified play with scoring mechanics like “Money Bird.”

 Each product is linked to a companion app that tracks scores, integrates mindfulness features, and extends engagement beyond the playing field. Underpinning the model is the integration of cognitive behavioral therapy principles, particularly the Thinking, Feeling, Behavior framework. By embedding these into products and programming, Torques connects physical play with emotional regulation and resilience training.

 From a market standpoint, Torques is not a single-product company. Revenue streams are designed to come from product sales, app adoption, curriculum licensing, video content through Torques TV, and activations at wellness events. The challenge will be scaling distribution and maintaining clinical credibility while growing, but the potential reach across consumer, educational, and clinical settings makes the model especially compelling.

 Why It Matters

 The throughline of Episode 8 is resilience translated into market opportunity. One founder uses writing as a path to recovery and community-building; another turns therapeutic principles into games that scale. For investors and potential partners, both ventures highlight a larger trend: mission-driven startups are finding traction not only because of their products but because of the authenticity behind them.

 Go Fund Yourself continues to provide these companies with something difficult to replicate—national visibility, constructive feedback from seasoned entrepreneurs, and the chance to connect directly with funders. For founders, it’s more than exposure; it’s a platform that validates vision while stress-testing strategy. Tune in September 25 at 7pmET on Cheddar TV for Episode 8!
