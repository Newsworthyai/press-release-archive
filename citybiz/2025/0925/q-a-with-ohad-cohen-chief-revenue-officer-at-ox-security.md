# Q&amp;A with Ohad Cohen, Chief Revenue Officer at OX Security

Ohad Cohen serves as Chief Revenue Officer at OX Security, a leading Application Security platform that empowers organizations to focus on the cyber risks that actually matter. In his role, Cohen oversees global sales operations and go-to-market strategy for a company that has emerged as one of the fastest-growing in the application security space.

 Prior to his promotion to CRO, Cohen was instrumental as Vice President of Sales in helping OX hit $10 million in sales and triple its customer base in just one year. The company now serves over 200 leading organizations globally, including Microsoft, IBM, Intel, eToro, and SoFi, and is fresh off its latest funding, a $60M round led by DTCP with participation from IBM Ventures, Microsoft, Swisscom Ventures, Evolution Equity Partners, and Team8.

 The goal remains singular and clear: help customers ship secure software faster and prove it with concrete metrics. Do that consistently across every engagement, and global scale follows naturally. Everything else is just tactics in service of this mission.

 With over 15 years of experience in software and cybersecurity sales leadership, including a successful tenure at Cider Security where he doubled ARR before its acquisition by Palo Alto Networks, Cohen brings deep expertise in scaling security companies. He now leads OX’s mission to transform how organizations secure their software development lifecycle – from code to runtime.

 What are the biggest challenges companies are facing in cybersecurity today?

 The cybersecurity landscape has fundamentally shifted with AI changing the game for both developers and attackers. Teams are being crushed by three interconnected problems that create a perfect storm of risk.

 First, the speed gap is killing us. While developers ship code faster than ever with AI assistance, attackers exploit vulnerabilities just as quickly, compressing the window from code commit to compromise to mere hours. Most security teams still operate on weekly cycles with manual processes, creating a dangerous risk gap where breaches thrive.

 Second, the signal-to-noise ratio is abysmal. Security teams drown in alerts without knowing which ones actually matter for their specific environment. Without the ability to determine what’s reachable, exploitable, and business-critical by connecting code to its runtime context, we’re paying talented people to sort through meaningless noise.

 Third, tool sprawl has created chaos without consolidation. Organizations deploy separate solutions for SAST, SCA, DAST, cloud, containers, and APIs, each providing only a slice of truth. Few can trace an issue from a line of code to a live service and back to the responsible team, making meaningful MTTR impossible.

 The talent shortage compounds these issues. There simply aren’t enough AppSec experts, so winning means embedding security directly into developer workflows without disrupting how they work. Meanwhile, compliance checklists keep auditors happy but don’t prevent breaches, as boards increasingly demand evidence of actual risk reduction tied to revenue protection.

 The winners will unify visibility from code to cloud, prioritize the relatively small set of issues that can actually hurt the business, and automate the path to fixes. Everything else is just expensive noise.

 Pretty much everyone knows what cybersecurity is but many may not know specifically what the multi-billion dollar industry known as application security (“AppSec”) is. Can you explain the distinction and why this sub-industry is a priority for organizations of various sizes?

 Cybersecurity is the big umbrella. It covers everything from network and endpoint to identity, email, data and more. Application security is the part that protects the software you build and ship. For many companies, that’s their main source of revenue that they must protect. Code, pipelines, open source, APIs, containers, cloud services. If it runs your product or your customer experience, it is AppSec.

 So AppSec is a priority for organizations of various sizes because their apps and APIs are the new perimeter. Attackers do not need your network if they can hit your login flow or a vulnerable dependency. Network, endpoint and even cloud controls cannot stop a security or logic bug in your checkout page.

 AI is accelerating both sides. Developers generate more code and attackers generate more exploits. That compresses the window from commit to compromise. AppSec is the only function sitting where that risk is created and where it must be fixed.

 The business impact is also direct. A critical app outage or data leak is revenue, churn, and brand. Boards no longer ask how many scans you ran. They ask which risky paths are closed and how fast you can prove it.

 Supply chain risk also lives in your app. Most modern software is assembled from open source and third parties. You own the blast radius when something upstream breaks. AppSec is how you see it, scope it, and remediate it.

 The simple distinction: cybersecurity tries to keep bad things out. AppSec ensures that the thing you ship is not the way in.

 You have a lot of experience in cybersecurity sales. What drew you specifically to cyber security and what attracted you to OX specifically?

 I like hard problems with real stakes. Cyber is where trust meets revenue. When something breaks, you feel it in customer experience, churn, and brand. That clarity drew me in.

 I got into AppSec because risk is created in code and fixed in code. You can spend millions on perimeter tools and still get breached through a pull request, an API, or a package you never vetted. I wanted to work where I could help teams prevent the incident, not just clean it up. And let’s face it: this is where innovation and real revenue is.

 More specifically, I came to OX for two main reasons: vision and execution.

 OX is unapologetically focused on outcomes. Cut the noise. Show what is reachable, exploitable, and business critical. Map it from code to runtime. Then make the fix fast for developers. The message is simple: Focus on what matters and prove that risk is going down.

 The platform connects the dots with code to cloud context and ownership mapped to teams, as well as AI-driven remediation that gives developers precise guidance.

 Time to value is measured in days, not quarters and as a CRO that matters because it means a clean story for buyers and fast proof in a POC.

 I joined OX because it treats security like a product feature for developers and a risk reduction engine for the business. That is where the market is going and I want to help lead it.

 OX has experienced explosive growth, tripling its customer base and hitting $10M in revenue just over the past year in a pretty crowded space. What’s driving the momentum?

 Crowded markets punish sameness. We are winning because our approach is different and not focused on showing problems. We cut noise, prove risk reduction, and help developers fix fast because scans are not outcomes.

 Customers care about their own risk and exposure, not a generalized scan result. We provide it for them. We rank by reachability, exploitability, and business impact specific for the customer. The result is massive noise reduction and a clear story for the board.

 We also provide code to runtime truth by tracing every finding from a line of code to the live service and the team that owns it. Moreover, our AI remediation and guardrails in the pipeline give security control over the policy and enable developers to implement precise fixes with context that prevent regressions.

 OX presents one platform for SAST, DAST, SCA, IaC, secrets, supply chain, containers, cloud and posture with a single risk model. This means fewer tools, lower spend and better signal.

 We are also leading the cybersecurity charge in the AI era, as AI accelerates code and attacks. Our customers use OX to keep pace and close the risk-to-fix gap before it widens, while at the same time, clear packaging, clean integrations, and measurable business outcomes make renewals easy and expansions natural.

 Most simply put: We help customers ship faster and safer. That is why we are growing.

 Looking at the future of application security, what trends are you most excited about?

 The future of AppSec is shifting from alert fatigue to measurable outcomes, and several trends are converging to make this transformation possible. Code-to-runtime graphs are becoming the source of truth, creating living maps that show reachability, exploitability, and blast radius while maintaining clear ownership. This visibility finally answers the question that matters: what can actually hurt us?

 Agentic AI is moving beyond chatbots to actively fix security issues with proper context. These systems provide secure code in real-time while maintaining human approval for critical decisions. We’re seeing root cause remediation at scale where fixing one risky pattern eliminates dozens of findings across repos, services, and teams.

 The evolution from SBOM to PBOM with runtime context represents a massive leap forward. Understanding which packages, APIs, and services are actually exposed in production environments allows us to prove why specific paths are safe or represent real risk.

 Risk reporting is maturing from scan counts to contracts with the board. Measurable risk reduction, improved MTTR, and closed attack paths that map directly to revenue protection replace meaningless metrics with business outcomes.

 Consolidation into unified AppSec control planes is accelerating. Single platforms now handle SAST, DAST, SCA, IaC, secrets, supply chain, containers, and cloud security with one risk model, eliminating tool sprawl and conflicting signals.

 Developer experience has now become security strategy. By meeting developers in their native environments with language-specific fixes and transparent safe-by-default policies, we’re turning every developer into a security champion without forcing them to become security experts.

 This convergence excites me because we’re finally moving from finding problems to delivering fixes faster than attackers can turn code into compromise.

 As you take on the CRO role, what are your top priorities for scaling OX globally?

 Scale is about repeatable outcomes, not headcount. I’m a strong believer that boards buy evidence, not sales jargon, so every engagement must demonstrate proof over pitch.

 We make it easy to start with one focused use case, then systematically roll OX across the entire organization. This means standardizing code-to-runtime visibility, evidence-based prioritization, AI remediation, pipeline guardrails, supply chain clarity, policy enforcement, and executive reporting. Our goal is to provide one comprehensive platform company-wide by focusing on clear outcomes instead of endless trials.

 Meeting customers where they live is critical. Deep integrations with GitHub, GitLab, Jira, and cloud marketplaces matter, and so do co-selling partnerships with top partners and systems integrators, relationships that multiply our reach without requiring proportional headcount growth.

 Pricing must map directly to value with transparent units tied to active builders and protected services. This makes it easy to start and predictable to scale, removing friction from both initial adoption and expansion conversations.

 Customer success becomes our growth engine through telemetry-driven QBRs, security champion programs, and root cause remediation rollouts that retire entire classes of issues.

 Happy customers who can demonstrate measurable risk reduction become our most effective sales force.

 The goal remains singular and clear: help customers ship secure software faster and prove it with concrete metrics. Do that consistently across every engagement, and global scale follows naturally. Everything else is just tactics in service of this mission.

 What advice would you give to other sales leaders in the cybersecurity space?

 Success in cybersecurity sales comes from selling outcomes rather than fear. Show closed attack paths, reduced MTTR, and concrete cost savings. Start every conversation with a meaningful difference you’ve made, not another dashboard full of red alerts that create panic without providing solutions.

 Deal discipline separates winners from also-rans. Time-box every POC with three specific KPIs, one clear owner, and a scheduled executive readout. This prevents endless evaluations and forces real decision-making. Create mutual action plans in every meeting with specific dates, named owners, and measurable outcomes. Hope isn’t a strategy, but a good MAP is.

 Kill custom work that won’t scale or repeat. Build playbooks that enable your entire team to succeed, not just your top performers. Train everyone to deliver a compelling two-minute board story focused on risk reduced, time saved, and money saved. The best sales teams run like well-oiled machines, not collections of individual heroes.

 Be ruthless about fit. If prospects can’t articulate how they’ll measure success or lack budget to properly invest, walk away respectfully. Your time is too valuable to waste on deals that will never close or customers who won’t succeed. Focus on organizations where your consolidation story delivers clear ROI and your pricing maps directly to the value you provide.

 Lock arms with product and customer success teams from day one. Design expansion opportunities into initial deployments. Use AI to scale preparation and coaching without sacrificing the human trust that closes enterprise deals.

 Remember that your best salespeople are happy customers who prove your value every day.
