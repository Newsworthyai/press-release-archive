 About the Owner

 “Pinspiration is a place to create memories, not just crafts.” – Angela Vondy, Owner

 Angela Vondy, Pinspiration Loveland Owner “I am a Colorado Native who was a stay at home mom for most of my early years. I love working with my hands to create and I have a passion for all things crafty. When I am not crafting, I love spending time with my grandchildren and attending car shows with my husband Steve whose passion is classic cars. I also enjoy the energy my two dogs, Kaya and Asha bring to our lives.

 I am looking forward to offering my community a place to gather and be creative. I want to open a studio where more avenues of creativity can be experienced while providing a nurturing place to “color outside the lines.” I am entering a chapter in my life where I can do the things that feed my soul.”
