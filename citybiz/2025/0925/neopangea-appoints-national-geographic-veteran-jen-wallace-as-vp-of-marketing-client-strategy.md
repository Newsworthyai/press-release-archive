# NeoPangea Appoints National Geographic Veteran Jen Wallace as VP of Marketing &amp; Client Strategy

NeoPangea, a leading creative agency specializing in interactive experiences and digital innovation, has announced the appointment of Jen Wallace as Vice President of Marketing & Client Strategy. Wallace joins NeoPangea after a distinguished career at National Geographic, where she spent nearly 2 decades developing media, digital products, and leading strategic business development initiatives.

 Wallace’s extensive background spans multiple facets of content creation and strategic development. Beginning her career in media and project management at Conde Nast, she transitioned to the photography industry at Jupiter Images (later acquired by Getty Images) before joining National Geographic Kids magazine as a photography editor. Her ability to adapt and excel across disciplines exemplifies the innovative thinking that has defined her career trajectory.

 At National Geographic’s Brand Studio, Wallace created interactive experiences, data visualizations, games, and microsites that pushed the boundaries of digital storytelling back when the internet was still finding its footing with content marketing and paid social. In 2016, she advanced to the National Geographic Experiences Team, where she led business development for traveling exhibitions, museum partnerships, and large-scale immersive projects.

 “We’ve worked with Jen for nearly a decade, and honestly, we’re lucky that we get to hang out with her full-time,” said Brett Bagenstose, Founder and Creative Director of NeoPangea. “She’s got the vision, the talent, and, most importantly, the ability to not only tolerate our uniqueness, but add to it. And that’s rare.”

 In her new role, Wallace will leverage her storytelling expertise and strategic vision to drive NeoPangea’s next phase of growth, focusing on boundary-pushing experiences and innovative client partnerships.

 “True to my Nat Geo roots, when I think about the expanding opportunities in experiential design, gaming, and interactives, I feel like an explorer with a map that hasn’t yet been charted,” said Wallace. “I’m eager to help drive business development at NeoPangea, forging new partnerships with brands, museums, and themed entertainment pioneers.”

 Wallace’s appointment reinforces NeoPangea’s commitment to attracting top-tier talent and expanding its strategic capabilities in the experiential design sector.
