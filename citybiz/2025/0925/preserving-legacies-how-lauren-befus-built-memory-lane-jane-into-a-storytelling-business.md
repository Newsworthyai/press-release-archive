# Preserving Legacies: How Lauren Befus Built Memory Lane Jane Into a Storytelling Business

Lauren Befus is the founder and CEO of Memory Lane Jane, a company dedicated to preserving family legacies through heirloom-quality biographies and personal storytelling. A former journalist, Lauren was inspired to launch the business after years of interviewing World War II veterans and uncovering powerful stories that had never been shared – even with their own families. Today, she helps families and business leaders capture histories that might otherwise be lost, turning them into meaningful keepsakes for future generations. Based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Lauren combines her passion for storytelling with an entrepreneurial spirit, positioning Memory Lane Jane as a trusted partner for families who want their stories preserved with the same care as their financial and cultural legacies.

 Turning a passion into a business takes more than just passion. You’ve got to be humble enough to ask for help, smart enough to hand off the things that drain you, and brave enough to actually charge what your work is worth.

 What inspired you to start Memory Lane Jane, and what need did you see in people’s lives that led you to build a business around personal storytelling?

 As a rookie newspaper reporter, I spent hours interviewing World War II veterans and was struck by how often they told me, “I’ve never shared this with anyone before.” These were extraordinary stories of courage and resilience, and yet they had remained untold. Even their families didn’t know! That experience lit a fire in me. I’ve always been drawn to people’s stories, especially the ones that don’t make the headlines but shape families and communities for generations. Over the years, I realized how many families were quietly losing their history because no one was writing it down. A grandmother’s beloved recipes, a father’s work ethic, the struggles and triumphs of building a family business. These were disappearing. I started Memory Lane Jane to make sure those stories are preserved in a way that feels as meaningful and lasting as the legacies themselves.

 What were some of the biggest challenges you faced early on, and what lessons have you learned about running a business along the way?

 Honestly, one of the biggest challenges has been confidence. I came into this with zero business experience. I’m a journalist and a creative, not a CFO or a marketer. There are still days when I think, “What am I doing? I should just get a ‘real’ job with a steady paycheck. I must be crazy.” Running a business has stretched me in ways I never expected. Finances, marketing, sales…it all fell on me. I tried to learn and study as much as I could, and I was quick to ask for help when I was stuck!

 Another challenge has been positioning. Families will readily invest in wealth management, philanthropy, art collections, but storytelling? At first, it wasn’t even on their radar as an heirloom worth the same kind of investment. Educating the market and showing people that their stories are just as valuable took time, and I’m still working on it today.

 Passion is a great starting point. But, phew, running a business is not for the faint of heart!

 Can you share a memorable project that really illustrates the impact Memory Lane Jane has on families and communities?

 One project that stands out was documenting the story of a first-generation immigrant who built what is now a fifth-generation family business and a true cornerstone in its community. He arrived in the U.S. with nothing but vision and determination, and over decades grew a company that today employs hundreds. Yet no one had ever documented his journey. Capturing that story, along with the family’s sacrifices and innovations became such a gift to the younger generation now stepping into leadership. The book wasn’t just a keepsake to put on a shelf, it became both a history and a roadmap. Storytelling doesn’t just preserve the past; it actively strengthens the future of families, businesses, and entire communities.

 As a small business owner, how do you manage your finances?

 As a small business owner, I wear a lot of hats and the financial side used to feel overwhelming. I’m a journalist and a creative at heart, not an accountant. I use Wave – a money management platform for small businesses – and it has been a lifesaver because it makes invoicing, tracking expenses, and reconciling accounts simple and intuitive. I can see cash flow at a glance, send professional invoices to clients, and keep everything organized without needing a finance degree.

 For me, the biggest benefit is peace of mind. I don’t have to worry that something is slipping through the cracks, and it frees me up to focus on what I love while knowing the financial foundation of my business is solid.

 What advice would you give to other entrepreneurs who are building a business around their passion?

 Turning a passion into a business takes more than just passion. You’ve got to be humble enough to ask for help, smart enough to hand off the things that drain you, and brave enough to actually charge what your work is worth. And don’t be shocked if imposter syndrome shows up even after your biggest wins. It usually means you’re stretching into new territory. In the beginning, saying yes to everything can be a good teacher, but over time the real growth comes from focusing on the clients who truly value what you do.

 Looking ahead, what’s next for Memory Lane Jane, and how do you hope to grow its impact over the next five years?

 Over the next five years, I want us to firmly establish Memory Lane Jane as the go-to brand for heirloom biographies, on par with how families think about estate planning. That means growing our reach into new markets, expanding partnerships with family offices and estate attorneys, and continuing to elevate our design and printing to museum-quality standards. My hope is that when families think about their legacy, storytelling is no longer an afterthought but an essential.
