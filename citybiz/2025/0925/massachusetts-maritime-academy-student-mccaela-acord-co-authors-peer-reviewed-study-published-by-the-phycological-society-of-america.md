# Massachusetts Maritime Academy Student McCaela Acord Co-Authors Peer Reviewed Study Published by the Phycological Society of America

Undergraduate researcher contributes to insights on microbiomes in polar marine ecosystems

 Massachusetts Maritime Academy (MMA), a top-ranked public university with undergraduate degree programs focusing on science, engineering, technology, math, and business that blend academics and experiential learning, is delighted to announce that McCaela Acord, a senior in the Marine Science, Safety, and Environmental Protection (MSSEP) program and resident of Sandwich, MA, co-authored a research article published by the Phycological Society of America’s Journal of Phycology. The professional organization promotes research, education, and communication in the field of phycology, also referred to as the scientific study of algae.

 Titled, “Exploring the Phaeosphere: Characterizing the microbiomes of Phaeocystis antarctica colonies from the coastal Southern Ocean and laboratory culture,” the 13-page document explores the microbiomes, also known as bacterial communities, associated with Phaeocystis antarctica, a key phytoplankton species in the Southern Ocean. The research paper compares the microbiomes found in natural colonies collected from the coastal Southern Ocean with those that develop in laboratory cultures over time.

 In more laypersons’ terms, the paper explores how tiny bacteria interact within large ocean ecosystems and how those relationships shift when taken out of their natural habitat.

 

 “Participating in this research has been a truly rewarding experience,” said Acord, who contributed to the 11-author study through her work at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. “It was exciting to collaborate on a project that explores the complexity of polar ecosystems and to see our findings published by such a respected scientific organization.”

 “McCaela’s contributions to this research reflects the caliber of students at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy,” said Dr. Heather Burton, MSSEP Department Chair, noting that Acord’s recent presentation of her work to a Marine Science Fundamentals class was met with great interest. “Her research exemplifies the power of experiential learning and the impact undergraduates can have on advancing marine science.”

 James McKenna, the dean of Undergraduate Studies at the Academy, praised Acord’s achievement, calling it “a testament to her dedication and to the collaborative opportunities MMA fosters with institutions like Woods Hole.”
