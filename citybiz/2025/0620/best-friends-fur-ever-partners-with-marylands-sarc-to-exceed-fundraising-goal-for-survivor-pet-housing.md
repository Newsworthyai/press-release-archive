# Best Friends Fur Ever Partners with Maryland’s SARC to Exceed Fundraising Goal for Survivor Pet Housing

The fundraiser enabled SARC to secure vital funding that helps keep families and their pets safe together, eliminating barriers for survivors seeking refuge with their animals.   Best Friends Fur Ever (BFFE), proudly partnered with the Sexual Assault/Spouse Abuse Resource Center (SARC) as a lead sponsor for a heartwarming community fundraiser to support SARC’s onsite kennel — a critical addition that will allow survivors of domestic violence to remain safely with their pets during their time of need.

 At the event held on Saturday, June 14th, SARC leadership announced that the campaign had surpassed its fundraising goal of $7,000, further enhancing its ability to provide life-saving services for individuals impacted by domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking.

 The family-friendly event and awareness parade took place at Concord Point in Havre de Grace, drawing an enthusiastic crowd. Guests enjoyed dog-friendly games, treat stations, photo opportunities, and most notably, a powerful parade down Main Street. Dogs, families, and local advocates walked together in solidarity, raising visibility for SARC’s mission and showing unwavering support for survivors.

 BFFE raised over $2,000 in the lead-up to the event. Co-founders and owners Pat and Kelly Cullum generously matched the amount raised by their team, helping SARC surpass its original goal and further its mission.

 

 “We believe every family member — including the four-legged ones — deserves safety and love,” said Kelly Cullum, co-owner and co-founder of Best Friends Fur Ever. “It’s an honor to support SARC’s vision for a future where survivors don’t have to leave their pets behind in order to find safety. This is what community looks like.”

 Best Friends Fur Ever extends heartfelt thanks to the guests, sponsors, staff, and volunteers who made the event a success. Every contribution — whether monetary or through parade participation — helped amplify SARC’s mission and expand its reach in the Harford County community.
