Resident move-ins began in February, with construction completion expected in February 2026.

 “Welcoming residents to The Hadley is a proud moment for our team,” said Angie Atkins, senior vice president of community management for Thompson Thrift. “This community offers a unique rental experience with single-story layouts, private entrances and upscale finishes. The Hadley introduces a refined housing option to North Port, tailored to those seeking upscale comfort and convenience.”

With private front door entries and private outdoor patios, these homes feature spacious one-, two-, and three-bedroom layouts with 10-foot ceilings, stainless-steel appliances, timeless tile backsplashes, designer fixtures and finishes, hardwood-style flooring, large walk-in closets, undermount sinks, private yards, detached garages, full-size washer and dryer, high-speed internet access and smart thermostats.

 Community amenities at The Hadley also include a fully equipped 24-hour fitness center, resort-style swimming pool, community grilling areas, pickleball court, one dog park, pet spa with grooming station, billiards and shuffleboard, Starbucks coffee bar, 24-hour emergency service response, and a user-friendly resident mobile app for rent payment, submitting service requests, community feed and more.
