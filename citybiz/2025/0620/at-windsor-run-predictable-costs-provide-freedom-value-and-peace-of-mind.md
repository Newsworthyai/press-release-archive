# At Windsor Run, Predictable Costs Provide Freedom, Value, and Peace of Mind

For Don and Judi Bartell, moving to Windsor Run, an Erickson Senior Living community in Matthews, N.C., has proven to be a wise financial decision–especially after experiencing increasing maintenance costs associated with their former house in Sun City, Ariz.

 “For us, the most appealing financial benefit of moving to Windsor Run is the long list of costs associated with homeownership that no longer apply,” says Don. “We also appreciate the fact that we no longer worry about repairs and upkeep to our home. We spent tens of thousands of dollars in repairs over the eight years we lived in Sun City. Now, our time is freed up for more enjoyable activities.”

 Since making the move, Don and Judi have been managing their budget with confidence and making the most of their retirement, knowing that maintenance is included in their monthly service package and their future is safe and secure.

 Predictable expenses

 In addition to maintenance and repairs, the monthly service package covers the costs of utilities, a meal plan at on-site restaurants, access to amenities, regularly scheduled transportation, and more.

 The package supports the more than 90% of seniors queried who say they want predictable monthly expenses to cover most of their daily activities, meals, and housing–according to a recent survey commissioned by Erickson Senior Living via Edge Research.

 “We discovered that almost half of our monthly service package is offset by all the homeownership expenses that we are no longer paying, including property taxes, insurance, yard maintenance, house maintenance, and HVAC,” says Don.

 “Plus, we no longer have the aggravation of monthly bills for utilities, internet, and TV. It’s all bundled, removing the hassle of all those bills,” he adds. “And everything is automated, so it’s very quick, easy, and trouble-free.”

 The couple enjoys dining at Windsor Run’s on-campus restaurants, so they’ve cut down on grocery and dining costs as well.

 Unbeatable value

 Many residents also appreciate the 90% refundable entrance fee*–the heart of the community’s pricing structure. The 90% refundable entrance fee, collected as part of the residency process, goes back to you or your beneficiaries, if or when you leave the community.

 For the Bartells, this was a real draw.

 “The 90% refundable entrance fee was a big deal for us; something many other communities do not offer,” says Don. “There is a psychological benefit that comes from knowing that we haven’t spent all our money. It’s still ours.”

 And because the entrance fee is unique to each residence’s features, living at the sought-after community is more accessible than many people realize.

 “Windsor Run boasts a range of one- and two-bedroom residences, which means we are able to accommodate many budgets,” says Sales Director Ryan Barkley. “People are often surprised by how much value they get for their money.”

 He continues, “And, because we continually invest back into our amenities and services, we’re ensuring residents’ quality of life and the vitality of the entire community well into the future.”

 Over the last year alone, Windsor Run celebrated the opening of two new residence buildings, a pickleball court, and Carolina Hall, the beautiful new 250-seat performing arts and meeting space.

 So much to gain

 Without the responsibility of maintenance and juggling bills, Don and Judi find that they have more free time to enjoy the activities and amenities on campus–at no extra fee.

 “With almost 100 clubs and interest groups available to us, our month-at-a-glance calendar is pretty crowded,” says Judi. “I joined the Welcome Committee for new residents, our building’s social committee, and a book club, and I take exercise classes in the fitness center. Don’s joined several lifelong learning groups, teaches a computer class, and helps new residents register to vote.”

 The couple also appreciates the peace of mind thanks to the Home for Life promise.* No one ever expects to run out of money, but sometimes unforeseen issues arise that can quickly deplete your hard-earned savings and put you at risk. Windsor Run is prepared to assist eligible residents who outlive their resources. No one will be asked to leave our community because of a genuine inability to pay.

 “I like the fact that if we live a long time and run out of money, the Resident Care Fund is there to help us out in a big way,” says Don. “Judi and I believe that moving to Windsor Run is a gift that keeps on giving–both for us and our two children, who feel the same way.”
