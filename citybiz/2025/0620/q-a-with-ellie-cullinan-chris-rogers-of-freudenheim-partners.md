# Q&amp;A with Ellie Cullinan &amp; Chris Rogers of Freudenheim Partners

Executive Vice Presidents at Freudenheim Partners, Chris and Ellie bring over 50 years of combined experience in commercial real estate, with a specialized focus on nonprofit tenant representation.

 Chris’s career spans more than three decades and has been shaped by his service on nonprofit boards, including Philanthropy Massachusetts and the Boston Children’s Museum. His firsthand experience gives him unique insight into the real estate needs and operational challenges of mission-driven organizations.

 Ellie began her career in 2000, inspired by her father’s work in real estate finance. From the start, she’s been passionate about helping purpose-led organizations find space that supports their growth, goals, and community impact.

 Together, Chris and Ellie offer a thoughtful, conflict-free approach to real estate—always putting their clients’ missions first.

 1. Can you tell us about your backgrounds and what led you to specialize in nonprofit tenant representation?

 How did you each get into commercial real estate? Ellie Cullinan: I started my career in 2000 after being introduced to the industry by my dad, George Fantini, who worked in commercial real estate finance. At Grubb & Ellis (which later became Newmark), I was exposed to a wide range of tenants, both for-profit and nonprofit across different sectors, including office, R&D, and lab spaces. As I developed my expertise in tenant representation, I found a deep passion for working with mission-driven organizations. Helping nonprofits secure space that supports their mission and growth is incredibly rewarding.

 Chris Rogers: I’ve been in commercial real estate for over 35 years, with a focus on tenant representation. My passion for working with nonprofit organizations stems from a deep understanding of the unique challenges they face—navigating tight budgets while needing space that supports their mission and community impact. Early in my career, I began volunteering on nonprofit boards, which gave me firsthand insight into these challenges from the other side of the table. Whether serving as Clerk of Philanthropy Massachusetts or on the Executive Committee of the Boston Children’s Museum, it was a privilege to work alongside dedicated staff who strive every day to make life better for others. That experience continues to inspire how I approach my work with nonprofit clients today.

 

What drew you to working with nonprofit organizations? Both of us are passionate about making an impact. Nonprofits play a vital role in the community, and we take pride in providing real estate solutions that allow them to focus on their mission while we handle the complexities of securing the right space at the right budget.

 2. What unique challenges do nonprofit organizations face when securing commercial space?

 How do budget constraints, mission alignment, and funding cycles impact leasing decisions? Nonprofits often operate under tighter budgets, with funding tied to grants and donor cycles. This means real estate decisions must balance affordability with mission alignment. They also need flexible lease structures to accommodate changes in funding and programming needs.

 What strategies do you use to help nonprofits navigate these challenges? We provide comprehensive financial analyses, including lease vs. buy evaluations and stabilized value-add/change-of-use analyses, to help nonprofits make informed decisions. We also explore sublease and relocation options to ensure cost efficiency while negotiating favorable lease terms that align with their long-term goals.

 3. Can you share recent nonprofit transactions that stands out to you?

 MassPIRG/Green Century Funds MassPIRG and Green Century Funds have been our clients for over 15 years. We recently worked on relocating MassPIRG within 294 Washington Street and renewing Green Century Funds’ lease at 114 State Street. What made this project unique was evaluating multiple scenarios simultaneously considering lease options, purchase options, and the possibility of combining both organizations in one space versus keeping them separate.

 The Little Cocoa Bean Co. at Boston Children’s Museum Another standout transaction was securing space for The Little Cocoa Bean Co., an early childhood brand focused on nutrition, education, and community engagement. They leased 3,000 SF at 308 Congress Street in Boston’s Seaport District, within the Boston Children’s Museum. This partnership was special because it brought together two mission-driven organizations dedicated to supporting children and families.

 How did Freudenheim Partners add value to the process? For The Little Cocoa Bean Co., we represented the Boston Children’s Museum and identified them as the ideal tenant, aligning their mission with the Museum’s goal of enhancing family-focused learning experiences. Our market expertise helped structure a lease that met both parties’ operational and programmatic needs, creating a space that will serve as a hub for culturally diverse nutrition programs and engaging educational experiences.

 For MassPIRG and Green Century Funds, we conducted a comprehensive search in a shifting market, exploring creative solutions to best meet their evolving needs. What makes this business rewarding is working with great people—MassPIRG and Green Century Funds are led by smart, creative, and kind individuals, which made the process even more enjoyable.

 4. You’ve worked with organizations like Empath, Social Innovation Forum, and Berklee School of Music. How does representing nonprofits differ from working with corporate clients?

 Are there different priorities, timelines, or approval processes? Absolutely. Nonprofits often have more complex approval processes involving boards of directors and multiple stakeholders. Timelines may be driven by funding cycles or programmatic needs, and decision-making is typically focused on mission alignment and community impact rather than purely financial returns.

 How do you tailor your approach? We take a mission-first approach, ensuring the space supports the organization’s goals while providing financial stability. Our strategies include comprehensive lease vs. buy evaluations, flexible lease options, and renewal vs. relocation analyses to help nonprofit clients make the best long-term decisions.

 5. What are the key factors nonprofits should consider when searching for office or program space?

 How can nonprofits balance location, cost, and flexibility? Location is critical for accessibility, but it must be balanced with cost and flexibility. We help nonprofits evaluate stabilized value-add opportunities, potential changes of use, and long-term cost implications to make the best decision.

 What should they be aware of in lease negotiations? Nonprofits should secure favorable lease terms that provide flexibility, such as termination options, expansion rights, and sublease provisions. It’s also essential to understand the total cost of occupancy, including operating expenses and potential rent escalations.

 6. What trends are you seeing in the nonprofit real estate sector?

 Are more organizations looking for flexible leases, shared spaces, or specific locations? We’re seeing increased interest in flexible lease terms and shared spaces that foster collaboration while controlling costs. Many nonprofits are also leveraging hybrid work models while maintaining a physical presence in their communities.

 Another trend is the growing interest in property ownership. With declining real estate values in the Central Business District, some nonprofits are exploring ownership opportunities that were previously out of reach. It’s an important consideration when evaluating long-term real estate strategies.

 How has the market changed post-pandemic? Nonprofits are reassessing their space needs, often opting for smaller, more efficient footprints while maintaining a community presence. Lease structures are becoming more flexible to adapt to evolving work environments. Additionally, uncertainty with the new administration is slowing transaction velocity, making strategic planning even more important.

 7. How does Freudenheim Partners differentiate itself in nonprofit tenant representation?

 What makes your approach unique? Our approach is conflict-free—we exclusively represent tenants, ensuring our clients’ interests always come first. Led by senior professionals with decades of experience, we provide strategic, mission-driven real estate solutions. Having seen nearly every scenario, we’re equipped to handle most any challenges that arise.

 How do your relationships and market knowledge benefit nonprofit clients? Our extensive relationships within the Greater Boston real estate community allow us to identify off-market opportunities others might miss. We leverage these connections to secure the best terms for our clients. Additionally, we facilitate collaboration among our nonprofit clients, which has been met with great enthusiasm.

 8. What advice would you give nonprofit leaders who are starting their real estate search?

 What common mistakes should they avoid? A common mistake is underestimating the time required for the real estate process, especially with multiple stakeholders involved. Another is failing to analyze long-term costs and potential space utilization changes.

 How can they best prepare for the leasing process? Engaging experienced real estate advisors early in the process is key. Conducting a thorough needs analysis, aligning internal stakeholders, and establishing clear financial parameters ensure a smoother, more strategic search. We recommend evaluating renewal vs. relocation strategies and lease vs. buy options to make well-informed decisions.
