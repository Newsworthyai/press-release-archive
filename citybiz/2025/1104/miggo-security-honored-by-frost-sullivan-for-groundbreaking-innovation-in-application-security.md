# Miggo Security Honored by Frost &amp; Sullivan for Groundbreaking Innovation in Application Security

In a strong endorsement of its next-generation cybersecurity approach, Miggo Security has been awarded the 2025 Global New Product Innovation Recognition by Frost & Sullivan for its leadership in application security. The accolade highlights Miggo’s pioneering work in redefining how organizations protect cloud and AI-native applications through its Application Detection and Response (ADR) platform.

 Redefining Application Security for AI and Cloud Environments

 Over the past few years, applications have evolved from static, monolithic systems into highly distributed, microservices-based architectures that leverage cloud and artificial intelligence. This shift has significantly expanded the attack surface, making traditional AppSec tools such as static code analysis, dynamic scanning, and web application firewalls increasingly insufficient.

 According to Frost & Sullivan’s official recognition, Miggo’s ADR platform stands out by offering real-time observability and protection in production environments. The solution bridges gaps left by legacy tools and delivers contextual, actionable insights that enable enterprises to identify and neutralize threats as they happen.

 Inside Miggo’s Award-Winning ADR Platform

 Miggo’s success comes from its cutting-edge architecture and AI-augmented defense model. Frost & Sullivan’s evaluation, which benchmarks companies based on strategic effectiveness and execution, found that Miggo excels in aligning innovation with market needs and delivering results with precision.

 At the heart of Miggo’s platform is DeepTracing, a technology that leverages eBPF and OpenTelemetry to capture every function call as an execution trace. This allows security teams to gain deep visibility into how benign code flows evolve into exploit chains. With this insight, teams can detect and block threats such as logic abuse, prompt injection, and behavioral drift in real time.

 Another standout innovation is AppDNA, which constructs dynamic dependency graphs that correlate user actions with APIs, code lines, and system calls. This correlation enables teams to identify real, exploitable vulnerabilities instead of wasting time chasing theoretical risks.

 Miggo’s WAF Copilot further differentiates the platform by introducing predictive response capabilities. Within minutes, it automatically generates and deploys custom protection rules, reducing time-to-exposure by over 90 percent compared to traditional WAF solutions.

 Industry Context and Market Timing

 The timing of Miggo’s recognition is no coincidence. The global application security market continues to grow rapidly, with MarketsandMarkets projecting the sector to reach USD 26.7 billion by 2028, up from USD 15.7 billion in 2023, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.2 percent. As more enterprises move workloads to the cloud and adopt AI, runtime protection and observability are becoming essential to secure the expanding attack surface.

 In April 2024, Miggo also raised 7.5 million dollars in seed funding, led by YL Ventures, to accelerate its ADR platform development and market reach.

 According to Miggo, deployments have shown a 30 times improvement in policy-violation detection, fewer false positives, and significantly reduced mean-time-to-detect (MTTD) and mean-time-to-respond (MTTR). Customers also report faster release cycles and improved risk visibility without increasing AppSec overhead.

 Why Miggo’s Approach Matters for Enterprises

 As enterprises continue to operate across hybrid cloud, containerized, and AI-driven environments, attackers are exploiting new pathways such as API abuse, service chaining, and prompt injection. Traditional monitoring and testing cannot fully secure these real-time systems.

 Miggo’s ADR model closes this gap by offering continuous runtime visibility and automated defense. Its agentless and sensor-agnostic design allows teams to integrate seamlessly across environments in under an hour, eliminating complex instrumentation while maintaining full coverage. This capability aligns closely with Gartner’s projection that by 2029, over 50 percent of successful attacks against AI agents will exploit access control vulnerabilities.

 Setting the Future Standard for AppSec

 Miggo’s recognition from Frost & Sullivan represents more than an industry accolade. It reflects a shift in how application security must evolve. As AI continues to influence how systems are built and breached, runtime security will become a foundational element of enterprise defense.

 The company’s approach to unifying observability, predictive intelligence, and automated enforcement signals where the industry is heading. Security must move from reactive to proactive, from static to dynamic, and from siloed detection to continuous protection.

 For Miggo, this milestone is not an endpoint but a launchpad. With Frost & Sullivan’s recognition validating its strategy and growing adoption among enterprises, Miggo’s challenge now lies in scaling execution globally and maintaining its innovation edge as the security landscape transforms.
