# Brodsky and Avery Hall’s 499 President Announces Three More Retail Tenants

499 President – a distinctive rental community for the new era of luxury living in Gowanus – is thrilled to announce three more retail partners: Union Market, Corto and Spear Physical Therapy. These respected local businesses join Paulie Gee’s and Royal Palms Shuffleboard, rounding out 40,000 square feet of carefully curated commercial space designed to anchor the world-class development and complement the surrounding Gowanus community.

 “Our vision was to curate an array of retail partners for our residents at 499 President and the growing Gowanus community at large,” said Alexander Brodsky, Partner at The Brodsky Organization, developer of 499 President alongside Avery Hall and Battery Global Advisors. “We are proud and excited to welcome Union Market, Corto and Spear Physical Therapy to the building as our newest additions.”

 Evan Clements, Austin Knief and Colleen Morrissey of Atlantic Retail represented Ownership of 499 President, while Mark Tergesen of ABS Partners Real Estate represented Union Market. Atlantic Retail also handled the Spear Physical Therapy and Corto deals.

 Union Market

 Union Market will debut a 10,000-square-foot flagship grocery store at 532–542 Union Street, adjacent to 499 President. Since opening its first shop in Brooklyn, the brand has earned a reputation for offering high-quality groceries, fresh produce, and a curated selection of local and organic goods. Its new Gowanus flagship continues that legacy, designed for residents who value convenience, quality, and community.

 “Gowanus is welcoming thousands of new residents who need an amazing neighborhood grocer. Bringing Union Market to the area just makes sense,” said Martin Nunez, Co-owner of Union Market. “Our mission has always been to provide the best groceries and top-quality provisions that make everyday life easier and more delicious. As the neighborhood continues to grow, we’re excited to become a central hub for both longtime locals and new residents.”

 Corto

 Corto will open a restaurant and café in a 1,000-square-foot space along Nevins Street, showcasing its blend of Italian hospitality and Brooklyn style. Known for its thoughtful, ingredient-driven menu and dynamic energy, the new Corto location will serve as a welcoming neighborhood anchor from morning espresso to evening dining.

 “We’re thrilled to bring our passion for authentic Italian flavors to 499 President and the broader Gowanus community,” said Cristiano Morroi, Owner and Chef at Corto. “By focusing on quality ingredients and traditional recipes, we aim to craft a warm and inviting environment that reflects this unique neighborhood’s culinary diversity. We can’t wait to open our doors.”

 Spear Physical Therapy

 Spear Physical Therapy, New York’s leading provider of award-winning rehabilitation services, now occupies a 2,500-square-foot clinic adjacent to Corto. The practice offers individualized physical and occupational therapy, empowering residents and neighbors to stay active, recover fully, and live well. Its presence at 499 President emphasizes the development’s holistic lifestyle approach — blending health, fitness, and wellness in an accessible, community-driven setting.

 “We’re excited to bring Spear’s people-first approach to Gowanus,” said Matt Morton, Senior Vice President of Development at Spear Physical Therapy. “Our mission has always been to help New Yorkers move better, feel stronger, and get back to the lives they love—whether they’re recovering from injury or pursuing performance goals.”

 A Well-Rounded Lifestyle at 499 President

 499 President is a distinctive rental community for the new era of luxury living in Gowanus. Where cutting-edge meets sophistication, the contextual brick development combines 350 modern apartments with remarkable lifestyle amenities and curated retail – all for a well-rounded lifestyle rooted in Brooklyn’s most interesting neighborhood.

 The newly announced retail partners complement Royal Palms Shuffleboard, a longtime neighborhood staple at 514 Union Street. Paulie Gee’s, known citywide for its inventive, wood-fired pies (“Hellboy” included), previously announced its plans to expand its Brooklyn footprint with a new restaurant at 499 President with plans to open this fall.

 “We’ve always felt a deep connection to Brooklyn, and joining 499 President allows us to continue that tradition in Gowanus, a neighborhood alive with art, community, and innovation,” said Kyle Driscoll, Partner at Paulie Gee’s. “Our goal is to deliver the same beloved Paulie Gee’s experience while contributing to the neighborhood’s evolving food narrative. We look forward to welcoming both locals and residents.”
