# Hadron Energy Advances its Regulatory Readiness Ahead of $1.2Bn Merger

As Hadron Energy, Inc. approaches its $1.2Bn SPAC merger with GigCapital7 Corp. (Nasdaq: GIG), the company showcases its proactive and foundational licensing approach with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

 Hadron’s light-water design offers a clear advantage with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the nation’s regulator for civilian nuclear power, which has decades of experience licensing this technology and currently oversees 94 operating light-water reactors in the United States. Building on that foundation, Hadron has executed a uniquely proactive approach to regulatory readiness since its founding.

 The company has sought engagement with the NRC as the commission forms policies with respect to the breakthrough advanced nuclear reactor industry. In December 2024, Hadron attended its first Advanced Reactor Stakeholder Meeting, where it became an active contributor to policy development in the MMR space, and continued to attend NRC public meetings regularly as it began to prepare its own regulatory strategy for the Hadron MMR. One critical meeting occurred on July 17-18, 2025, where Hadron Energy stood as the only company to publicly support a more restrictive safety framework for microreactors and other low consequence reactors; it is a framework that Hadron has full confidence its Halo MMR will meet.

 In April 2025, the company submitted a Letter of Intent and initial Regulatory Engagement Plan (REP), which began the process of formal pre-application engagement with the NRC. Following its initial public meeting, Hadron also filed an updated REP aligned with the NRC’s latest guidance to streamline the commercialization of its microreactor, and since that time, has continued to follow its REP, making quality submissions on time and informed by NRC feedback. Hadron has filed its Quality Assurance Program Description (QAPD) and will soon file its Topical Report on Principal Design Criteria (PDC).

 Hadron continues to pursue its regulatory goals despite the government shut-down, developing comprehensive topical reports and hiring essential talent that will be foundational to the Halo MMR’s safety case and instrumental to development and commercialization of the Halo MMR. As a result of the front-loaded approach Hadron has taken with its regulatory strategy, Hadron continues to stay ahead of its corporate deadlines and on track for the rapid commercialization of its microreactors.

 In addition to this persistent and collaborative approach with the NRC, Hadron has engaged with representatives of the Department of Energy (DOE), the federal agency tasked with the promotion of nuclear energy. Hadron looks forward to working with the DOE further to make the revitalization of America’s nuclear industry a reality, including through the Janus Project, the DOE’s initiative to achieve readiness in the installation and operation of MMRs in military bases of the U.S. Armed Forces.

 Leading up to its $1.2Bn SPAC merger with GigCapital7 Corp. (Nasdaq: GIG), Hadron is committed to a collaborative, transparent, and forward-thinking regulatory approach, positioning itself as a primary partner to the Federal government in revitalizing the U.S. nuclear industry. The company is looking forward to working with its government partners in restoring America’s energy independence and setting the national standard for a secure, competitive, and American-led nuclear future.
