# Plato’s Closet Opens New Location in Williamsburg

Plato’s Closet®, the leading teen and young adult retail resale concept, is excited to announce the grand opening of its newest location in Williamsburg on November 13. Located inside Midtown Row at 1248 Richmond Rd, the brand is known for providing local teens and young adults with a place that not only puts cash back into their pockets but sells gently used brand-name clothing and accessories in a variety of styles and sizes for less.

 With a focus on being a sustainable shopping resource, the new Plato’s Closet in Williamsburg is part of Winmark – the Resale Company®, a unique national retail resale franchise that focuses on sustainability, small business formation and providing Resale for Everyone®.

 Meet the Local Owners

 The new Plato’s Closet Williamsburg is locally owned and operated by Austin and Jennifer Saylor, a husband-and-wife duo with deep roots in Virginia. Jennifer, a Williamsburg native and graduate of William & Mary, previously worked as a coastal geologist and environmental scientist before pursuing her passion for sustainability through business ownership. Austin brings years of retail experience, having worked in his family’s five Plato’s Closet stores across Virginia since he was 15 years old.

 “I’ve always been passionate about sustainability and finding ways to give items a second life,” said Jennifer Saylor. “Opening Plato’s Closet in my hometown allows us to combine that passion with an opportunity to support local students and families. We’re excited to create a space where teens and young adults can shop affordably, earn cash for clothes they no longer wear, and feel good about doing it.”

 Beginning on November 13 and throughout the weekend, Plato’s Closet Williamsburg is inviting guests to stop in to experience the following:

 More About Plato’s Closet Williamsburg

 Unlike a typical consignment store, no appointment is necessary to sell clothing and accessories to Plato’s Closet. Customers can achieve savings up to 70 percent off trendy, brand-name clothing and accessories and receive cash on the spot for gently used items that are outgrown or no longer wanted.

 Winmark’s resale concepts allow for gently used clothing and accessories to end up in someone else’s closet rather than thrown into a landfill, providing a resource for shoppers who are looking to update their closet in a mindful environmental manner.
