# La Posada Celebrates Resident Esther Whitley’s 109th Birthday

Palm Beach Gardens’ oldest resident honored with 109 roses from Palm Beach Gardens’ Fire Rescue team

 La Posada Senior Living community proudly celebrated a remarkable milestone as its oldest resident—both in tenure and in age—Esther Whitley marked her 109th birthday, making her the oldest known resident in Palm Beach County.

 Born in 1916 in Lake View, South Carolina—then known as Pages Mill, a town named after her family—Esther Whitley has lived a full and vibrant life rooted in family and community. The Pages trace their lineage back to John Page, who emigrated from England in the late 1600s. Growing up on a 500-acre farm, Esther learned early the values of hard work, kindness, and perseverance—principles that have guided her throughout her long life. In 1937, she married Thomas E. Meyers, and his naval career took them from Charleston to New York and later Washington, D.C.

 Following Thomas’s passing in 1973, Esther eventually moved to Florida, where she remarried and later became part of the La Posada community. She raised two sons, Thomas and Richard, and one daughter, Rita, and is the proud grandmother of four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Known for her warm smile, quick wit, and unwavering optimism, Esther continues to inspire everyone around her every day with her grace and joy for life.

 “I’m so thankful to see 109,” said Whitley, La Posada resident. “Every day is a blessing, and I’m grateful to be surrounded by so many kind people who make life so special. I feel lucky to share this moment with my family. Life has taught me many valuable lessons—one being the importance of community—and that’s exactly what I experience here at La Posada, surrounded by such wonderful staff, friends, and family. What a great way to celebrate!”

 Esther marked the incredible milestone surrounded by her loving sons, daughter, friends, and fellow residents. The Palm Beach Gardens Fire Department, inspired by Esther’s kindness and joy for life, paid a special visit and presented her with 109 roses in recognition of her remarkable longevity—an act that made her day even more memorable.

 The La Posada Life Enrichment team organized the celebration as part of the community’s ongoing commitment to honoring residents’ stories and life journeys.

 “Esther is an inspiration to all of us at La Posada,” said Brad Cadiere, Executive Director at La Posada. “We’re so honored to celebrate this incredible milestone with her and her family. She has been part of our community for 22 years and each year we’re blessed to celebrate her life and spirit. Her joy and resilience remind us why community is such an important part of healthy aging.”

 According to the National Institute on Aging, older adults who engage socially and maintain strong community connections tend to live longer, healthier lives. La Posada fosters that sense of belonging through resident-led programs, events, and daily activities that encourage connection and purpose.
