October 18 Event Celebrates Organization’s Pioneering Legacy, Promising Future

 In honor of its 75th anniversary, The Arc Baltimore will present “Carats & Cocktails,” an unforgettable evening honoring The Arc’s pioneering legacy and celebrating the promise of its future.

 To be held on Saturday, October 18 beginning at 7 p.m. at the Maryland Science Center, “Carats & Cocktails” presented by Mutual of America Financial Group will feature: diamond and champagne giveaways; a live musical performance by Nelly’s Echo (from NBC’s “The Voice”); a DJ set of funk, soul, and R&B by Landis Expandis; a culinary spread by Rouge Catering; signature spirits by Old Line Spirits; an auction with artwork created by artists with disabilities and much more; and full access to the Maryland Science Center exhibits.

 

 “Carats & Cocktails” attendees can also purchase raffle tickets to win a genuine diamond valued at $1,200 – $1,600 and a three-night Tuscan Wine Experience for two couples, a $5,000 value. Raffle tickets are limited and can be purchased in advance at www.thearcbaltimore.org/carats/.

 “For 75 years, The Arc Baltimore has been a powerful force for inclusion, built on the courage of four sets of parents who, in 1950, dared to dream of a better life for their children with intellectual and developmental disabilities,” says Kathleen McNally Durkin, The Arc’s Chief Executive Officer.

 “Their grassroots movement transformed a narrative of isolation into one of endless possibilities, ensuring children and adults with disabilities are valued and included in the community,” Durkin continues.

 In honor of its Diamond Anniversary, The Arc Baltimore has set an ambitious goal of raising $175,000. Proceeds from “Carats & Cocktails,” as well as donations and contributions from personal fundraising pages, will directly fuel The Arc’s mission, allowing it to further its support for people with developmental disabilities.

 Tickets for “Carats & Cocktails” are $175 per person or $1,650 for a table of 10. To purchase tickets, visit www.thearcbaltimore.org/carats or call 410-296-2272 ext. 5216.

 For 75 years, The Arc Baltimore has been supporting people with developmental disabilities to lead fulfilling lives with a sense of belonging, purpose, and meaningful relationships. With more than 700 full- and part-time employees, The Arc Baltimore provides employment training and support, day and residential services, family support and education, treatment foster care, assistive technology services, respite care, and public policy advocacy.
