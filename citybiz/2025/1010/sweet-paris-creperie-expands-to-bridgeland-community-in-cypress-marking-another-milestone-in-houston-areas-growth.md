Now, with the Bridgeland location officially open, Mike and his team are excited to welcome the community to experience what makes Sweet Paris special.

 “This new location is more than just a business, it’s a way to be part of something bigger,” said Kelton. “Bringing Sweet Paris to Bridgeland gives me the opportunity to be involved in a community I care about, support local youth programs and nonprofits, and create a place where families and friends can come together and enjoy an incredible meal.”
