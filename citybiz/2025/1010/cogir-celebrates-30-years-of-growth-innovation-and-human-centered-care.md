# Cogir Celebrates 30 Years of Growth, Innovation, and Human-Centered Care

This year, Cogir is proudly celebrating its 30th birthday, marking three decades of innovation, growth, and a people-first approach to real estate and senior living. What began as a small Canadian venture has since evolved into a cross-border success story, one that now spans over 100 communities in the United States alone.

 The story of Cogir began in 1995, when Serge G. Duguay, a passionate real estate entrepreneur in Québec, Canada founded the company at the age of 55. With a focus on revitalizing shopping centers, Serge enlisted his 17-year-old son, Mathieu Duguay, to help manage a property, igniting what would become a lifelong passion for community-building.

 By 1999, Cogir had expanded into residential and retirement living. In 2004, Serge passed the torch to Mathieu, selling him the company while remaining actively involved. Under Mathieu’s leadership, Cogir diversified further, launching its own development and construction division in 2008 to take projects from blueprint to reality.

 In 2013, Cogir partnered with Welltower, a global leader in health and wellness real estate, laying the groundwork for international expansion.

 In 2018, Cogir and Welltower did their first partnership in the US together, acquiring 12 communities across Washington and California. Just two years later, in 2020, Cogir USA was officially established, complete with a dedicated leadership team and an ambitious vision.

 Today, Cogir USA proudly manages over 100 communities across the country, offering vibrant senior living experiences rooted in human connection, creativity, and excellence. From exceptional dining and wellness programming to purpose-driven care, Cogir USA continues to grow while staying true to its founding values.

 “Thirty years ago, we set out to create spaces where people could thrive, not just live,” said Mathieu Duguay, CEO of Cogir. “Today, with over 100 communities in the U.S. and a legacy of innovation behind us, we’re just getting started.”

 As Cogir celebrates this milestone, the company remains focused on its mission: building communities that foster joy, connection, and purpose for residents and team members alike.
