# State Roundup: Moore Targets Foster Care System For Repair Following Teen’s Suicide; Officials Flock To BWI To Support Federal Workers

MOORE PROMISES REPAIR TO FOSTER SYSTEM FOLLOWING TEEN’s SUICIDE: After an autopsy report confirmed that a teen girl under the state’s supervision died by suicide while living in an East Baltimore hotel, Gov. Wes Moore said Wednesday his administration would fix the problems with Maryland’s foster care system. Lee O. Sanderlin/The Baltimore Banner.

 STATE, FEDERAL OFFICIALS SUPPORT BWI’s WORKERS WORKING WITHOUT PAY: Maryland Democratic officials on Wednesday thanked federal workers who are continuing to show up for work during the government shutdown even though they’re not getting paid now and urged Congress and the president to end the budget stalemate. “We’re here at BWI today because 550 TSA agents and 70 air traffic controllers, support staff and management are employed here and currently working without pay as essential employees,” said Rep. Sarah Elfreth. “We have a very simple message: Shutdowns don’t fly.” Mira Beinart of Capital News Service/Maryland Reporter.

 * “It’s a stunning contrast when we have federal workers who will continue to do their jobs with discipline and dignity, and distinction and pride — and we have a president who is going to shut down his own government and rob hardworking men and women from the paycheck they have already earned,” said Gov. Wed Moore. Nicole Pilsbury/Maryland Matters.

 THE SHUTDOWN BY THE NUMBERS: This is the 21st partial or full shutdown since the 1977 fiscal year. About 62% of all the shutdowns in that time occurred under the presidency of Ronald Reagan or Jimmy Carter. The 2025 shutdown is the first in six years and the fourth this century.

 MARYLANDERS SUE HEALTH DEPT OVER MEDICAID WAIVER ISSUES: A handful of people with disabilities who use a Medicaid waiver for in-home care and other services are filing a class action lawsuit against the Maryland Department of Health for being unlawfully disenrolled from the program. The suit could encompass as many as 18,000 Marylanders with intellectual and developmental disabilities who used the waivers prior to May 2023 to pay for care. Scott Maucione/WYPR-FM.

 ACTING BUDGET SECRETARY NAMED AS SEARCH CONTINUES: A veteran of the Department of Budget and Management will take over next week as acting secretary in place of departing Secretary Helen Grady. Deputy Secretary Marc Nicole will take over as acting budget secretary effective Oct. 15. Grady announced Nicole’s appointment to staff Wednesday, when it was confirmed by a Moore spokesperson.

 B’MORE SEES SHARP RISE IN INFANTS BORN WITH SYPHILIS: Baltimore’s yearslong struggle with sexually transmitted infections now has a troubling new trend: a sharp rise in the number of babies born with syphilis. The bacterial disease among the city’s youngest has quadrupled in less than 10 years, spiking to almost four times the national rate. Meredith Cohn/The Baltimore Banner.

 MOORE REMOVES MOST OF B’MORE LIQUOR BOARD: Gov. Wes Moore’s office confirmed Wednesday that Moore is removing three of the four members of Baltimore’s Board of Liquor License Commissioners, including longtime head Albert Matricciani Jr. The board is a state agency.

 B’MORE EMPLOYEE RECEIVED PAID LEAVE WHILE IN JAIL: Baltimore Department of Transportation employee arrested and incarcerated for attempted carjacking and second-degree assault was kept on the city payroll and received about $2,000 in paid leave, Baltimore Inspector General Isabel Mercedes Cumming announced.

 PURPLE LINE SEEKS NOISE WAIVER FOR NIGHTTIME CONSTRUCTION: Purple Line officials have requested a noise waiver from Montgomery County to allow for nighttime construction on the light-rail line’s Bethesda station that will include a connecting tunnel and new southern entrance to the underground Bethesda Metro Station, according to a waiver notice.

 ARUNDEL COUNTY TO APOLOGIZE FOR ITS ROLE IN SLAVERY: Anne Arundel County will apologize for its role in supporting and enforcing slavery on Nov. 1 — Maryland Emancipation Day — and host a conversation to reflect on the future, County Executive Steuart Pittman announced this month.

 MARYLAND BOARD DETAILS SOMERSET SCHOOLS MESSY DYSFUNCTION: Details from two opinions issued by the Maryland State Board of Education offer a window into the dysfunction in Somerset County, where a MAGA-aligned school board has collided with the Eastern Shore community’s quiet conservatism. In March, the superintendent felt so threatened during a call with the school board chair that she left town, afraid for her safety. At a board meeting in April, the chair played recorded excerpts from a book that explicitly described oral sex between two men, then falsely claimed the book was part of the county curriculum. In June, the board fired the superintendent for insubordination before giving her a chance to defend herself. Liz Bowie/The Baltimore Banner.

 BA CO GOVT SOLAR FARM READIED FOR LAUNCH: Crews are preparing to switch on four solar arrays with a total of 15,000 panels at Baltimore County’s closed landfill in Parkton. The solar farm is expected to account for about 11 percent of the electricity that county government consumes annually. It’s the county government’s first large-scale ground-mounted solar facility.
