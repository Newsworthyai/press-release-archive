# Renovation Sells Launches InstantBid™ for Kitchen Estimates

Renovation Sells, a national renovation franchise that manages design, construction, and financing under one roof, announced the launch of InstantBid, a consumer-ready platform that delivers quick and accurate kitchen renovation estimates through iPhone Pro scans.

 Developed in collaboration with RENDR, InstantBid is a first-of-its-kind tool offering homeowners and real estate agents real-time renovation cost projections powered by LiDAR technology and backed by Renovation Sells’ nationwide project database. Sourcing costs for material and labor from thousands of completed projects in over 35 franchise locations, InstantBid provides proven pricing that homeowners and agents can trust.

 “InstantBid isn’t just another AI design app — it’s an educational resource that addresses a common challenge: no one knows what kitchen renovations truly cost,” explained Amanda Valente, Co-Founder of Renovation Sells. “Now they can get clear, upfront pricing in minutes, right on their phone, without ever having to call a contractor. That kind of transparency gives homeowners the confidence to plan and make smarter renovation decisions.”

 With a franchise model that blends national efficiencies with seamless local execution, Renovation Sells is committed to streamlining the renovation process. With the development of InstantBid, Renovation Sells enables homeowners to receive accurate pricing for their kitchen, with no appointments, pressure, or guesswork. InstantBid combines automation with real local data and hands-on support, offering the only instant estimate backed by a team that can deliver the renovation.

 Users download the RENDR app, provide contact information and the project address, follow guided steps to scan the kitchen with an iPhone Pro, and receive an instant renovation estimate that covers updates such as cabinet refinishing, backsplash, and countertops—all within minutes. After the scan, a local Renovation Sells team member follows up by email to answer questions and discuss the next steps, ensuring the experience remains personal and local.

 “As an agent, InstantBid is a resource that enables me to deliver immediate value to my clients,” said Kevin Van Eck, Licensed Realtor®, Maverix Advisory Group. “It empowers sellers to make informed decisions that attract more buyers, while positioning me as a trusted advisor focused on maximizing their return.”

 With InstantBid, Renovation Sells continues to push the renovation industry forward by making costs clear and outcomes attainable. By pairing advanced technology with a trusted local network, the company is redefining what homeowners and agents can expect from the renovation process.
