 D1 Training, a leading fitness and enrichment concept that utilizes the five core tenets of athletic-based training to help people of all ages, from youth athletes to fitness-minded adults, reveals an enhanced structured path to ownership designed to help franchise owners launch confidently and grow with purpose. Through a defined sequence of strategic stages – supported by best-in-class resources, hands-on training, and community-driven integration – D1’s approach provides clarity, consistency, and support throughout every step of the franchise journey.

 A Defined Path to Ownership

 The D1 Training path to ownership is a strategic, six-phase journey that provides structure and ongoing guidance from the first inquiry through long-term operations. Each stage is designed to empower franchisees to make informed decisions:

 * Exploration & Discovery: Every franchise journey begins with a deeper understanding of D1’s brand philosophy, training model, and investment structure. Prospective owners engage in discovery calls, connect with existing franchisees, and participate in a Discovery Day to experience the brand culture firsthand.
* Validation & Commitment: Following the discovery process, franchise candidates complete validation with current owners and finalize agreements, joining a network of mission-driven entrepreneurs. D1’s development team works closely with each candidate to ensure alignment with the brand’s values, goals, and growth vision.
* Site Selection & Facility Development: Guided by D1’s real estate and construction teams, owners leverage data-driven market analytics to identify high-potential locations. From lease negotiation through construction, the brand provides templates, design support, and access to trusted vendor relationships to streamline development.
* Training & Operational Readiness: Prior to opening, new owners and general managers attend D1’s immersive Operator Training at the home office. This comprehensive program covers business operations, sales and marketing systems, and the five tenets of athletic-based training – dynamic warm-up, performance, strength, core and conditioning, and cool down.
* Pre-Sales & Community Integration: D1 provides detailed playbooks and marketing tools to help owners build early awareness through grassroots outreach, local partnerships, and brand activation events. This phase emphasizes positioning D1 as a trusted hub for athletes, families, and fitness enthusiasts.
* Ongoing Support & Growth: Beyond the grand opening, franchisees receive ongoing operational guidance through Regional Business Coaches, access to marketing platforms, and continued collaboration across the D1 network. For those pursuing multi-unit growth, the brand offers dedicated strategic support and area development opportunities.

 “At D1, our path to ownership is designed to make every step of the journey intentional and supported,” said Dan Murphy, Chief Executive Officer of D1 Training. “We’ve built a framework that gives franchisees the structure, training, and tools they need to confidently introduce D1 to their communities.”

 With more than 155 facilities open nationwide, D1’s growth is fueled by increasing demand in scholastic training, as the competitive youth sports landscape creates greater need for facilities where young athletes can hone their skills. Combined with D1’s adult and personal training offerings, and the brand’s comprehensive support systems and scalable business model, make it an attractive opportunity for entrepreneurs looking to bring a nationally recognized training concept to their communities.

 D1’s growing national footprint has also earned recognition among the top franchise brands in the country, climbing 42 spots on the Franchise Times Top 400 ranking in 2025.
