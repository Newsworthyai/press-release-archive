# For the Fifth Consecutive Year, Lorien Assisted Living is Recognized as a ‘Top Winner’ in the 2025 Daily Record Reader Rankings

Lorien Assisted Living, a family-owned assisted living company based in Maryland, has been named the “Top Winner” in two different categories of the Daily Record’s 2025 Reader Rankings Survey.

 Lorien was recognized as “Best Assisted Living” and “Best Retirement Community” in Maryland as part of the Daily Record’s 2025 Reader Rankings. This was the fifth consecutive year Lorien has been named a “Top Winner” in the Reader Rankings survey.

 “The results of the Daily Record’s Reader Rankings survey highlight our steadfast commitment to our residents, their families, and to the positive growth of Lorien Assisted Living,” said Lou Grimmel Sr., Chief Executive Officer of Lorien Health Services.

 The recognition comes at a time when Lorien has opened a new innovative memory care neighborhood called Hamony Park. Its design, which is unique to Howard County, brings the outdoors inside; creating a beautiful park-like environment to assist in calming and engaging those with dementia. Residents can interact with the various sensory elements, all within the safety and security of Harmony Hall’s Assisted Living community in Columbia, MD.

 John Mangione Jr., Chief Operating Officer of Lorien Health Services, added, “We are proud to be recognized by Marylanders as a leader in delivering high-quality healthcare services. Our focus on personalized care and innovation motivates us to continually improve the well-being of those we serve. This recognition reflects the exceptional work of our devoted team, nurses, and caregivers.”

 The Daily Record Reader Rankings celebrates and recognizes the best the Maryland community has to offer through a nomination round, a voting round and an annual celebration revealing the top winners. Each category in the survey was made up of five entrants that were narrowed down to the top three and then the ‘Top Winner’, which will be celebrated on October 20.

 In addition to Memory Care, Lorien Assisted Living communities across Maryland offer a host of innovative care including on-site Dialysis, Parkinson’s Care, Korean Senior Care, and Residential Home Care Services (Lorien at Home), with additional new services to be offered in 2026.
