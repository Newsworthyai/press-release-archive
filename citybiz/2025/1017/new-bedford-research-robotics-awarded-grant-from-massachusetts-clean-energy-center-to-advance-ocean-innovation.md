# New Bedford Research &amp; Robotics Awarded Grant from Massachusetts Clean Energy Center to Advance Ocean Innovation

New Bedford Research & Robotics (NBRR) has received a $65,000 award from the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC) as part of the state’s new Ocean Innovation Network, a program providing more than $11 million in funding to strengthen Massachusetts’ position as a global leader in ocean technology.

 MassCEC selected to make the statewide announcement at New Bedford Research & Robotics, with all recipients in attendance for the event. The announcement was made at NBRR during the Southeast stop of MassCEC’s Climatetech Corridor Roadshow, which followed morning sessions at UMass Dartmouth. Dr. Emily Reichert, CEO of MassCEC, was joined by New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell to highlight the South Coast’s growing role in the Commonwealth’s clean energy and climate technology ecosystem. According to Reichert, New Bedford holds a “special place” in the hearts of MassCEC’s leadership for its longstanding contributions to the blue economy and offshore wind innovation.

 “The investment from MassCEC will allow us to expand our hands-on support for oceantech startups while helping to train the next generation of the blue economy workforce,” said Mark Parsons, Executive Director of New Bedford Research & Robotics. “Access to CNC technology not only strengthens product development but also provides valuable workforce training opportunities in high-demand manufacturing skills.”

 NBRR’s grant will fund the acquisition of a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine, a high-precision manufacturing tool that will enable startups working within the NBRR ecosystem to prototype components for underwater robots and other oceantech innovations on-site. The addition of this advanced equipment will streamline the development process, reduce production costs, and accelerate innovation for early-stage companies.

 Following the announcement, Parsons led a tour of NBRR’s developing facility, showcasing the center’s growing capabilities and its role in supporting Massachusetts’ ocean innovation community. This milestone underscores New Bedford’s emergence as a hub for ocean innovation, clean energy, and the future of offshore wind, strengthening the city’s place at the heart of America’s blue economy.

 In addition to NBRR’s grant, the New Bedford Ocean Cluster (NBOC) received $2.13 million to expand facilities, support its Maritime Business Incubator, and install new prototyping equipment at NBRR, further cementing New Bedford’s leadership in marine innovation.

 New Bedford Research & Robotics serves as a hub for researchers, entrepreneurs, and companies focused on ocean-related technologies, including robotics, offshore wind, and clean energy. By providing technical resources, collaborative space, and workforce development programs, NBRR is helping to shape the future of Massachusetts’ blue economy.
