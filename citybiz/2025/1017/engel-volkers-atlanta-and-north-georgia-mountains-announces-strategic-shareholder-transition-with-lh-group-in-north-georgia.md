# Engel &amp; Völkers Atlanta and North Georgia Mountains Announces Strategic Shareholder Transition with LH Group in North Georgia

Engel & Völkers Atlanta and North Georgia Mountains, Metro Atlanta’s leading luxury brokerage in new home sales, today announced the completion of a strategic shareholder transition with LH Group, a distinguished North Georgia-based real estate team specializing in mountain homes, lakefront property and developer success. The leadership realignment marks a major milestone as LH Group moves to local ownership and operation, becoming the new majority shareholders and license partners of the North Georgia Mountains office.

 Christa Huffstickler, founder and CEO of Engel & Völkers Atlanta & North Georgia Mountains, will remain a shareholder, providing support and ensuring synergy between the North Georgia Mountains and the real estate firm’s broader operations. Overall, Engel & Völkers’ brand continues to demonstrate strength and stability, outperforming the market by 6% in 2024 (Source: E&V Americas 2024 Transactions). With North Georgia continuing to emerge as one of the Southeast’s premier destinations for second homes and investment properties, this move signifies the next phase of expansion and community engagement in the market.

 “This transition reflects our firm’s continued growth and strategic alignment across our entire Engel & Völkers network,” said Huffstickler. “Together with the team at LH Group, this newly formed leadership structure will strengthen our regional presence and reinforce our shared mission of delivering exceptional service and maintaining the high standards of excellence synonymous with Engel & Völkers.”

 LH Group combines 22 years of real estate experience and consists of real estate duo Linda Baker and Heather Foresman. Since launching their team in 2022, Baker and Foresman have consistently achieved the honor of No. 1 Small Team in Northeast Georgia and have earned global recognition, ranking as the No. 8 Top Producing Team worldwide within Engel & Völkers.

 Serving clients across Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee, LH Group maintains a strong foundation of a personalized, community-focused approach that has helped accelerate growth in the North Georgia Mountains. On average, more than one in-network referral closes every day within the Engel & Völkers Americas network, with 450 in-network referrals closed last year alone. As a result of the brokerage’s partnership with Engel & Völkers, LH Group is a proud member of the brand’s prestigious Private Office, which represents the highest level of service in luxury real estate and a client-first approach.

 “Our goal is to strengthen the foothold of the now independently owned Engel & Völkers North Georgia Mountains shop by creating a more community-oriented culture,” said Baker. “We want to expand brand visibility through local engagement while continuing to support our advisors with hands-on leadership and strategic growth initiatives.”

 According to Engel & Völkers Atlanta and North Georgia Mountains, the North Georgia Mountains continue to outperform expectations, with more than 25 sales above $3 million in the last year, based on data from the Northeast Georgia MLS. With limited competition, sweeping scenery and the convenience of being within a single day’s drive from Florida, the market is primed for continued growth.
