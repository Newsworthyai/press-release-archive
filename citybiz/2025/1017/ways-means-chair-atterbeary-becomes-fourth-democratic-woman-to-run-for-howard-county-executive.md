# Ways &amp; Means Chair Atterbeary Becomes Fourth Democratic Woman To Run For Howard County Executive

To a cheering crowd of over 300 people, Del. Vanessa Atterbeary, chair of the House Ways & Means Committee, formally announced Wednesday night that she wants to run the government in Howard County where she grew up. She promised to continue her fight for school funding, affordable housing, police reform and gun control.

 She is the fourth Democratic woman to give up good chances for reelection to their current elected offices to run for executive. This could lead to a tough primary among fellow lawmakers whose winner is likely to become the chief executive for 340,000 people.

 Before her announcement, much of the Democratic establishment, including her state senator and District 13 slate-leader Guy Guzzone, chair of Senate Budget and Tax Committee, had endorsed Del. Jessica Feldmark of District 12A. Feldmark was also endorsed Wednesday in a press release by former Howard County Executive Ken Ulman, for whom she served as chief of staff, former delegate and slate-mate Shane Pendergrass, and current Del. Pam Guzzone, Guy’s ex-wife.

 But Atterbeary also has major supporters. She was introduced by State Treasurer Dereck Davis, a 27-year veteran of the House of Delegates from Prince George’s County. House Speaker Adrienne Jones, D-Baltimore County, sat next to Davis on stage applauding, but did not speak. County Council member Opel Jones spoke to the crowd endorsing Atterbeary.

 Two of Opel Jones’ fellow Democratic County Council members are running for county executive, Deb Jung of West Columbia and Liz Walsh of Ellicott City-Elkridge.

 Also supporting Atterbeary are Howard County State’s Attorney Rich Gibson and Del. Chao Wu of District 9.

 The large crowd in the auditorium of the Harriet Tubman Cultural Center in Columbia, the county’s all black high school that closed after desegregation in 1965, was heavily African American. Many are current and former elected officials from outside Howard County. These included Baltimore City State’s Attorney Ivan Bates and former Prince George’s County Executive Rushern Baker.

 “We have an opportunity for a fresh start next year here in Howard County with new people and new ideas,” said Atterbeary, who spoke for about 17 minutes. Perhaps alluding to a potentially divisive Democratic primary, Atterbeary went on, “I like to think of our county government as a family. Behind closed doors, we all know that families can argue, but when those doors open, we have to come together around a vision for the betterment of the county. The county executive, the county council and the school board.”

 “At the core, we all have the same goals to support in our community, protect our home and ensure a bright future for our county. Howard County will continue to stand as a beacon of inclusion and progress, and we will not let hate, division or fear find a way in our county.

 “As county executive, I will also go to Annapolis, a place I’m a little familiar with, to make sure Howard County has the resources that we need, whether we’re dealing with the government shutdown, economic uncertainty, or political gridlock. Together, we can make sure we’re building workforce housing, working in strong partnership for a better school system and preserve the things that make this county so special.”

 “Some people say I’m tough, as I look at my colleagues from Annapolis. and they’re right, but I’ve had to be tough,” said Atterbeary. “It’s tough when you’re trying to make her-story, and it’s tough when you’re trying to take care of a community that you love and you care about so deeply.

 “Howard County deserves a leader who listens, who unites, who gets things done and who does not forget what she is fighting for. That’s what I’ve done in Annapolis, and that is what I intend to do, as your next county executive.”
