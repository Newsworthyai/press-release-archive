# Balfour Senior Living and University of Colorado Anschutz Launch Living Lab to Advance Aging Research

Balfour Senior Living, a Kisco collection, in partnership with the University of Colorado Anschutz Multidisciplinary Center on Aging, is pleased to announce the launch of its research community living lab at the Balfour Louisville campus.

 This initiative brings together CU Anschutz’s pioneering research with Balfour communities’ expertise in resident care to create an interactive environment where academic studies directly engage with older adults in their living spaces. Residents will have opportunities to participate in studies, serve in advisory roles and contribute to shaping meaningful advancements in aging and healthcare.

 “The launch of the living lab marks a transformative step in how we approach aging and healthcare,” said Dr. Cari Levy, Head in the division of Geriatrics at CU Anschutz. “By partnering with Balfour, we are creating a collaborative space where research and real-life experiences come together to drive innovation.”

 The living lab offers a variety of studies that residents may qualify for, including research on hearing and hypertension, neurophysiology related to walking and more efficient ways for nurses and associates to support skilled nursing residents. Residents can participate by joining studies and serving on the advisory board, where they help evaluate research programs to ensure they align with the needs and values of their community.

Even if our generation doesn’t benefit from the study now, we are contributing to research that will help improve the health of others in the future.”

 “We get to have input instead of just being told what has been decided,” said resident Jean Bedell. “Here, we’re seen as real people and get to share our insights. A lot of older adults struggle to find a sense of purpose, and this helps give them one.”

 The partnership between Balfour communities and CU Anschutz is helping advance senior care and drive innovation in the senior living industry. The program enhances services by fostering empathy, strengthening engagement, and providing associates with tools to better support residents and their families.

 “At Balfour, our mission has always been to provide exceptional care while fostering meaningful experiences for our residents,” said Michael Sell, business development director at Balfour Senior Living. “The partnership with CU Anschutz allows us to take that commitment even further by bringing cutting-edge research into our communities and empowering residents to help shape the future.”
