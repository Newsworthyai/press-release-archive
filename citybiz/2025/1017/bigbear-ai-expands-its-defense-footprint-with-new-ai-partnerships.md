# BigBear.ai Expands Its Defense Footprint With New AI Partnerships

BigBear.ai Holdings is positioning itself as a rising player in defense technology, deepening its push into artificial intelligence through new partnerships aimed at bringing smarter computing to battlefields and naval operations. The Columbia, Md.-based company, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker BBAI, is betting that defense modernization and AI-driven analytics will fuel its next stage of growth—even as it navigates uneven financial results and valuation concerns.

 The company’s latest alliances with Tsecond and SMX have caught the attention of defense analysts. The partnership with Tsecond, announced earlier this month, will pair BigBear’s ConductorOS AI orchestration platform with Tsecond’s portable BRYCK hardware system. The compact, high-capacity unit can process data directly in the field—what’s known as edge computing—allowing military operators to analyze drone footage or sensor inputs in real time without sending data back to central servers. The collaboration could make BigBear’s technology more attractive to the U.S. Army and other defense agencies looking to strengthen situational awareness in contested environments where communications can be disrupted.

 

 At the same time, BigBear is extending its reach into maritime operations through a new agreement with SMX, revealed at the Navy’s UNITAS 2025 exercise. The company plans to integrate its ConductorOS and Arcas analytics systems into unmanned and hybrid naval platforms. The technology can identify patterns of vessel movement and flag suspicious activity across wide ocean zones, supporting both defense and homeland security missions. Chief Executive Kevin McAleenan, the former acting Secretary of Homeland Security, has emphasized that BigBear’s experience in AI-driven analytics positions it well to serve a broader range of national security applications.

 Despite its operational strides, BigBear’s latest quarterly results showed mixed performance. For the second quarter of 2025, revenue fell 18% to $32.5 million from $39.8 million a year earlier, largely due to delays in U.S. Army programs. Gross margins narrowed to 25% from 27.8%, and adjusted EBITDA losses widened to $8.5 million from $3.7 million. A large noncash charge related to convertible debt revaluation and goodwill impairment drove a net loss of $228.6 million. Yet the company exited the quarter with a record $390.8 million in cash, boosted by a $293 million equity raise that turned its balance sheet positive for the first time in years.

 Investors have rewarded BigBear’s strategic repositioning. Shares have more than doubled in 2025, recently trading around $9, lifting the company’s market capitalization to roughly $3.3 billion. Still, valuations remain lofty: its forward enterprise value-to-sales ratio exceeds 22, compared with a sector median below 4. Analysts say the stock reflects strong optimism about BigBear’s AI integration in defense, but also significant execution risk.

 BigBear’s next earnings report, expected in November, will test whether its new partnerships are translating into revenue momentum. Analysts will watch for progress in delayed Army contracts, margin improvement, and evidence that Tsecond and SMX collaborations are contributing to bookings. With global tensions keeping defense spending high, and governments seeking AI tools to modernize forces, BigBear is trying to turn technological promise into durable profitability.
