– OTR Solutions announces placement on FreightWaves 2026 FreightTech 100 List –

 OTR Solutions, a full-service freight factoring and transportation technology company, will join industry leaders at FreightWaves’ Future of Freight Festival (F3) on Oct. 21–22 in Chattanooga, Tennessee, bringing its expertise in freight technology and back-office automation to one of the logistics industry’s most influential events.

 Highlighted by a fireside chat with company leaders and a live product demo of Epay Manager, its innovative back-office automation and payments platform, OTR is set to have a strong presence at this year’s event. Attendees will also have the chance to connect with the OTR and Epay Manager teams at their booth (Booth #3), where personalized demos and networking opportunities will be available throughout both days.

 “Our participation at F3 reflects OTR’s unwavering commitment to empowering the people who move this industry forward,” said Clayton Griffin, President of OTR Solutions. “The past few years have been incredibly challenging for carriers and brokers alike, and we believe there’s no substitute for spending time with, listening to, and learning from the professionals who keep our nation moving. Their feedback fuels how we continue to innovate and raise the standard of service they deserve.”

 Guests at the show can make plans to attend the following events:

 * 4:00 pm ET Tuesday, October 21 | Fireside Chat: From Surviving to Thriving: Maximizing Carrier Performance with Adam Wingfield, Founder and Managing Director of Innovative Logistics Group, and Brad Guinane, Chief Revenue Officer of SONAR
* 10:15 am ET Wednesday, October 22 | Rapid-Fire Demo: Audit 70 Invoices in 7 Minutes with OTR Solutions’ Ryan Johnson, Director of Product Management, and Mike Tempestini, Product Manager of Broker Services

 On Tuesday, Wingfield and Guinane will jointly discuss three influential perspectives from across the industry, exploring how carriers can leverage data fundamentals and industry insights from Playbook to drive sustainable growth. The following day, attendees can see how OTR’s advanced Doc Insights feature in Epay Manager uses AI-NLP technology to process, review, and approve invoices almost instantly, significantly reducing manual audit time and eliminating bottlenecks for brokers, carriers, and factors.

 Epay Manager, powered by OTR Solutions, was designed to help brokers improve the accuracy and speed of invoicing, reduce manual audit processes, automate payments, and enhance working capital for freight brokers. The tool replaces manual, email-based invoicing with proactive workflows and advanced AI-driven auditing. It streamlines AP/AR processes and boosts cash flow across the logistics network.

 “Stop by our booth to meet the OTR Solutions and Epay Manager teams. We’d love to connect, hear your story, learn about your business, and explore how we can be a resource toward your success. And of course, we’ll have koozies and drinks ready to accompany the good conversation,” continued Griffin.

 Building on the enthusiasm, OTR Solutions has been named to the FreightWaves 2026 FreightTech 100 list, which recognizes the most innovative and disruptive companies transforming the transportation and logistics industry through technology. This recognition acknowledges OTR’s commitment to developing solutions that empower brokers and carriers to thrive in a rapidly evolving freight landscape.
