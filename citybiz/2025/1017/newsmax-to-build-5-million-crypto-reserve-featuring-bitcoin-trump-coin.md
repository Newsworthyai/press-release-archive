# Newsmax to Build $5 Million Crypto Reserve Featuring Bitcoin, Trump Coin

Newsmax plans to wade into digital assets, unveiling a plan to create a cryptocurrency reserve that will include bitcoin and a new token linked to former President Donald Trump.

 The conservative media company said Thursday it intends to buy up to $5 million in bitcoin and Trump Coins over the next year, marking its first formal investment in crypto. The move would also make Newsmax the first company listed on the New York Stock Exchange to hold a Trump Coin on its balance sheet, according to the firm.

 Chief Executive Christopher Ruddy said Trump Coin’s value is designed to reflect what he called “the success of the Trump presidency, which so far has been impressive.” The coin, part meme token and part political statement, has drawn attention from retail traders and Trump supporters who view it as both an investment and a symbol of allegiance.

 Newsmax said it will begin its first purchases “in the near future” and make additional acquisitions depending on market conditions. The initiative, Ruddy said, aims to diversify Newsmax’s assets and signal confidence in digital currencies tied to cultural and political movements.

 Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, has regained momentum this year as companies and institutional investors renew interest amid easing inflation and a stable regulatory environment. Trump Coin, a newer, far smaller player, has seen volatile swings since its debut earlier this year, following Trump’s re-election campaign announcements.

 Analysts say Newsmax’s move underscores how crypto continues to attract unconventional entrants—especially in the media and entertainment sectors—seeking both publicity and exposure to alternative assets. Still, some caution that blending political branding with speculative assets could pose reputational and financial risks.

 For Newsmax, the plan marks another effort to capitalize on its audience’s affinity for the former president while stepping into a market segment increasingly shaped by politics and populism. Whether the investment yields financial gains or simply headlines, it highlights the blurred boundaries between digital finance, brand identity, and modern political culture.
