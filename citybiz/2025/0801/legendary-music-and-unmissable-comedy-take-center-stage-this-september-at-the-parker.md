# Legendary Music and Unmissable Comedy Take Center Stage This September At The Parker

The Parker’s Lillian S. Wells Hall sets the tone for a standout September with a slate of performances that spans iconic rock, pioneering synth-pop and sharp-witted comedy. Audiences in the mood to revisit the soundtrack of a generation or discover today’s boldest voices in comedy will find The Parker delivers all this and more.

 Once hailed by Rolling Stone as “the band that plays hot enough to melt the polar icecaps,” George Thorogood & The Destroyers, presented by the Broward Center and AEG Presents, has built a five-decade career fueled by more than 8,000 live shows and more than 15 million albums sold. The gang is back and ready for a guitar-slinging, amp-blasting, roof-shaking rock party like never before at The Parker on Tuesday, September 2 at 7:30 p.m. George and longtime Destroyers Jeff Simon (drums), Bill Blough (bass), Jim Suhler (guitar) and Buddy Leach (saxophone) are now taking all the drum-bashing, bass-pounding, sax-wailing, monster guitar energy of the past five decades and pouring it into “The Baddest Show On Earth Tour” as part of the Cleveland Clinic Rock Series. VIP packages are available.

 Electronic music pioneer Howard Jones, who has sold more than 10 million albums worldwide and has been a constant presence on the international touring scene for the past four decades, lights up the stage at The Parker when the Broward Center for the Performing Arts and Live Nation present Howard Jones with special guest Haircut 100 featuring Richard Blade on Friday, September 5 at 7 p.m. His ubiquitous hits can be heard in “Stranger Things,” “Breaking Bad,” “Watchmen,” “The Carrie Diaries,” “Superstore” and “Bumblebee.” Jones first burst onto the contemporary music scene in 1983 with his very English songwriting and pioneering synthesizers with “New Song.” His first album, “Human’s Lib,” reached number one in the U.K. in 1984 and featured the hits “New Song” and “What Is Love?” In 1985, Jones released “Dream into Action,” which quickly became a top ten Platinum album in the U.S., featuring “Things Can Only Get Better,” “Life in One Day,” “No One Is to Blame” and “Like to Get to Know You Well.” In 2022, Jones released his most recent album, “Dialogue,” the third album in a trilogy of electronic releases. VIP packages are available.

 Celebrating their 55-year milestone, Grand Funk Railroad, the iconic rock band from Flint, Michigan, presents their “Loco-Motion Tour” on Friday, September 26 at 7:30 p.m. at The Parker as part of the Cleveland Clinic Rock Series. Formed in 1969, the band became a top-selling American rock group of the ‘70s with high-energy performances and hits including “We’re an American Band.” Still at the helm are founding members Don Brewer (vocals, drums) and Mel Schacher (bass), joined by a stellar lineup of Max Carl (vocals, 38 Special), Mark Chatfield (guitar, Bob Seger’s Silver Bullet Band) and Tim Cashion (keyboards, Bob Seger, Robert Palmer). Known for their explosive live shows, Grand Funk Railroad brings their classic sound to both new and longtime fans. With their timeless hits and unmatched stage presence, the band continues to prove why they’re still “The American Band.”
