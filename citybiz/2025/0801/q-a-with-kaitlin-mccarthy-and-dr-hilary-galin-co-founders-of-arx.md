# Q&amp;A with Kaitlin McCarthy and Dr. Hilary Galin, Co-founders of ARX

Kaitlin McCarthy is the co-founder of ARX, a women-owned personal protective equipment (PPE) brand, and the founder and CEO of Ionic Development Company, a Boston-based, real estate development and consulting firm established in 2022. With more than 15 years of experience across real estate development, engineering, and construction, she has been instrumental in delivering transformative projects across Greater Boston.

 McCarthy’s academic background includes a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering from Northeastern University and a Master of Business Administration from Harvard Business School. Her professional journey encompasses roles such as vice president at The HYM Investment Group, where she was integral to major developments including The Sudbury – a 46-story residential tower – and One Congress – a 52-story office tower – both part of the Bulfinch Crossing development in downtown Boston.

 At ARX, McCarthy collaborates with co-founder Dr. Hilary Gallin to reimagine PPE with a focus on both fit and function for women. Outside of her work at ARX, McCarthy’s dedication to pioneering women’s leadership in real estate development has been recognized through various platforms, including Boston Real Estate Times Outstanding Women of Commercial Real Estate Awards, Northeastern University’s Women Who Empower Innovation Awards, and Northeastern University College of Engineering’s Young Alumni Impact Award. Her journey from engineering to founding one of Boston’s first women-owned real estate development firms serves as an inspiration for aspiring female entrepreneurs in the industry.

 Dr. Hilary Gallin is the co-founder of ARX, a women-owned personal protective equipment (PPE) brand reimagining safety gear to prioritize both fit and function for women. With a unique background that bridges medicine, engineering, and business, Gallin brings a multidisciplinary perspective to designing innovative solutions that address longstanding gaps in healthcare and workplace safety.

 Gallin earned a Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering from Yale University, a Doctor of Medicine from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and a Master of Business Administration from Harvard Business School. She is a board-certified Anesthesiologist.

 Prior to co-founding ARX with Kaitlin McCarthy, Gallin co-founded FastLine, a medical device company. Her clinical expertise, combined with her technical and entrepreneurial acumen, informs her mission to elevate PPE standards and advocate for more inclusive, evidence-based design in healthcare and beyond.

 

 What inspired you to create ARX PPE?

 We both come from industries where personal protective equipment (PPE) is essential – construction and healthcare – but we kept running into the same problem: nothing fit. The gear was designed for men, and women were left with unsafe, uncomfortable, and sometimes humiliating options. We realized something had to change.

 What makes ARX different from traditional PPE companies?

 We design specifically for women from the ground up – not just smaller versions of men’s gear. Every detail, from fit to function, is engineered with women’s bodies and workflows in mind. We’re not retrofitting old systems; we’re rebuilding the standard. We have held numerous focus groups with women across industries to get to really know our customer.

 

 What has the response been from women using ARX gear?

 It’s been incredibly validating. We’ve heard from women who say it’s the first time they’ve ever felt comfortable and confident in their PPE. They love the many features that were thoughtfully added (or not added!). That’s the kind of impact that keeps us going.

 Why is now the right time for ARX?

 The industry is finally paying attention. With the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recently reinforcing that PPE must fit, the timing of our launch couldn’t be more aligned. There’s regulatory momentum, cultural momentum, and frankly – there’s a growing workforce of women demanding change.

 What’s next for ARX?

 We’re expanding the product line to cover more trades and needs – because women are everywhere, and they deserve gear that works. We’re also working with institutions and large employers to help shift purchasing policies. This isn’t just about products; it’s about changing the system.
