# Woofie’s of Concord-Manchester Expands Premier Mobile Pet Care Services, Celebrates Grand Opening

On the heels of its soft launch a few months ago, Woofie’s of Concord-Manchester is officially celebrating its grand opening and growing demand for its premier pet care services for owners of dogs, cats, and other animals in the South Central New Hampshire area. Woofie’s of Concord-Manchester – offering dog walking, grooming, and daytime as well as overnight pet sitting – has doubled its staff since opening for business in March and has added an additional mobile pet spa to address increasing demand from pet owners in Auburn, Bow, Candia, Concord, Dunbarton, East Candia, Goffstown, Hooksett, and Manchester. Woofie’s of Concord-Manchester will officially celebrate its grand opening on August 23rd at Bark in the Park Market and Expo in Concord from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.

 Woofie’s of Concord-Manchester is operated by local residents Jennifer Flecker and her husband Arty, drawing on maintenance, medical, and leadership backgrounds in the military. The couple, living in Bow, are parents to three grown children – AJ, Austin, Kaitlyn – and 15-year-old Alison, and are also pet parents to Mr. KitKat (domestic feline), Ramen (Husky/Lab mix), Mac (Mixed breed), and puppy Moxie (Cane Corso).

 Woofie’s of Concord-Manchester will participate in Bark in the Park Market and Expo on August 23rd from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. at 33 Bow St., Concord, New Hampshire. It will offer an event-only “spaw” menu of tip-to-tail services for dogs for purchase, showcase one of its two state-of-the-art mobile spaws, and give away treats for furry friends and owners. It will also hold a free raffle for a $100 gift certificate good for a full grooming service. Leashed dogs are welcome.

 Woofie’s of Concord-Manchester also offers 24/7 vet telehealth services through a collaboration with Pet Vet Connection to help give pet owners peace of mind when they need medical advice. Additionally, they have partnered with premier dog food maker, The Farmer’s Dog, and Ancestry(R) to bring awareness for our mixed breed furry friends.

 “At Woofie’s of Concord-Manchester, we are passionate about what we do and how we do it – in supporting the local community and our team members to provide the very best care for pets and services for their owners. The fact that we have experienced an increase in clients and furry friends every month since our soft launch in March is a testimonial to that commitment,” says Jennifer. “We are invigorated by the community’s support and look forward to continuing to expand as a one-stop-shop for experienced grooming, pet sitting, and dog walking.”
