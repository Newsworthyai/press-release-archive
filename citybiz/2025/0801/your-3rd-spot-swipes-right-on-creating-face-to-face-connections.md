# Your 3rd Spot Swipes Right on Creating Face-To-Face Connections

Social Dining Leader Upgrading Membership Experience to Create a More Cohesive Community

 Instead of swiping, scrolling and exchanging DMs, more people are craving face-to-face connection, and Atlanta’s Your 3rd Spot has zeroed in on that desire. Since opening in 2022, it has built an experiential social dining space where people can come together to play arcade games, cornhole, low-tech outdoor games or a round of bowling—while also sharing craft cocktails and shareable cuisine.

 Last year, Your 3rd Spot launched a membership program designed for people who live or work within a five-mile radius of its Upper Westside location. For a nominal annual fee, members can enjoy members-only community connection events, 50% off Experiences Passes and bowling reservations, discounts on food and private events and opportunities to skip the line on select experiences.

 Starting today, Your 3rd Spot is upgrading the membership experience to create a more cohesive community and better embrace the meaning of a third spot. Each member will also receive complimentary entry so they can visit to drink, dine and mingle, only paying for an Experiences Pass if they want to play the games. They will also receive a complimentary guest pass each month to bring a guest along.

 “As we got close to the first anniversary of our membership program, we were excited about how many people joined, and we also saw a chance to do more when it came to building a real community,” says Doug Warner, co-founder and chief solutions officer of AMP Up1 Hospitality. “We’re doubling down on what a true third spot should be–a place to swing by for a cocktail, a bite to eat and some conversation. A place where you can come in and belong while seeing a mix of familiar faces and new ones.”

 Guests can get a taste of the membership experience with a special membership anniversary party on Thursday, Aug. 7. Non-members can attend for $30 and make face-to-face connections with people who could be future friends.
