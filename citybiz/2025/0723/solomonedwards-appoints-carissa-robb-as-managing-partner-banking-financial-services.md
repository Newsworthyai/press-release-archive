# SolomonEdwards Appoints Carissa Robb as Managing Partner, Banking &amp; Financial Services

SolomonEdwards, a national professional services firm focused on solving critical business challenges for companies undergoing growth, change or compliance-driven events, today announced the promotion of Carissa Robb to managing partner of its Banking & Financial Services (BFS) practice.

 Robb’s appointment reflects SolomonEdwards’ commitment to delivering finance, risk and operations solutions tailored to the complex needs of the highly regulated BFS industry.

 Since being named a partner in 2024, Robb has served as a strategic advisor to C-suite leaders at a range of institutions, from multinational banks to credit unions and fintechs. As managing partner, she will continue to lead the BFS vertical, helping clients navigate regulatory complexity, digital transformation and operational growth with a focus on practical, results-driven solutions.

 “Carissa brings a rare combination of strategic foresight, regulatory remediation and startup innovation,” said John Gulnac, CEO of SolomonEdwards. “Her leadership is redefining our role from a traditional compliance partner to a strategic enabler that empowers BFS leaders to be risk-ready, tech-savvy, and execution-focused. I’m excited to support her in this next chapter of growth.”

 That vision is already shaping the growth and impact of the BFS practice under Robb’s leadership. She has built a team of former regulators and industry veterans who bring insider perspectives to every engagement. Following the successful integration of The Dominion Advisory Group in November 2024, she expanded the practice’s expertise in financial crimes compliance and broadened its offerings in M&A readiness and technology enablement. In addition, Robb has prioritized partnering with clients’ Project Management Offices to support enterprise-wide initiatives and ensure seamless, cross-functional execution.

 “Over the years, we’ve positioned ourselves as a trusted partner for financial institutions balancing the demands of modernization and risk management,” said Robb. “We’re continually raising the bar on delivering strategic and tactical support, and I’m excited to scale that impact even further.”

 Prior to SolomonEdwards, Robb served as president and chief product officer of a financial services SaaS startup and held senior executive roles at TD Bank. She is also an active community leader, serving as president of the board at Riding To The Top, a therapeutic horseback riding center, and as a board member and softball coach with Portland Little League.

 With a client-first approach, top-tier talent and adaptable delivery models, SolomonEdwards turns complexity into clarity, data into decisions and challenges into opportunities. To learn more, visit SolomonEdwards.com.
