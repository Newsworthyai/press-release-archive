# Q&amp;A with Julia Rodgers, CEO of HelloPrenup

Julia Rodgers is a seasoned family law attorney and the CEO and founder behind HelloPrenup. She’s helped countless couples navigate the legal twists and turns of love and get on the same page prior to marriage.

 She’s been recognized as an esteemed honoree of the vLex Fastcase 50 list, won academic awards such as Award Recipient for “Outstanding Graduate of the Last Decade,” and celebrated as one of Inc. Female Founders 500 list.

 What is HelloPrenup and how does it support couples?

 HelloPrenup is the first-of-its-kind digital platform for prenuptial agreements. Our platform is designed to make prenups more accessible, affordable and collaborative for modern couples. Through a guided questionnaire, HelloPrenup asks questions like “Which property should be separate?” or “What should happen to pets in a divorce?” and flags differences between partners to encourage open dialogue and mutual understanding on sensitive topics. Negotiating these topics helps couples align on financial expectations, shared responsibilities and long-term goals, strengthening trust and transparency throughout the process.

 Plus, HelloPrenup has developed a trusted network of over 100 attorneys—from award-winning experts and Ivy League alumni to some of the nation’s most respected family law leaders—to ensure every couple receives the highest caliber of legal protection if they need or want to add on legal services.

 By empowering shared decision making and starting collaborative financial conversations, HelloPrenup supports couples in achieving clarity, trust and security in their relationship before tying the knot.

 Julia, your founder story is unique. How did you create the idea for the business and how did the company get off the ground?

 The idea came to me during my years working in family law and seeing first-hand how financial misunderstandings can strain marriages and derail divorces. And with the U.S. divorce rate remaining stubbornly high at 40–50%, less than 10% of couples have prenups—a massive gap in legal and financial preparedness that I wanted to help close.

 Knowing that traditional prenups are expensive, time-consuming, and out of reach for most people, I wanted to find a better solution to protect all couples, regardless of their wealth, before marriage. That’s when the lightbulb went off: What if there’s a different way for couples to approach a prenup together?

 Getting HelloPrenup off the ground wasn’t easy. As an entrepreneur with no funding or team, I spent my life savings and many sleepless nights bringing this dream to life myself. HelloPrenup successfully launched in 2020. Our appearance on Shark Tank in 2021 was instrumental; it was where Kevin O’Leary and Nirav Tolia became trusted investors and advisors for the company.

 Today, HelloPrenup captures 20% of the overall U.S prenup market, is available in 48 states and has protected over $25 billion in assets—and that’s just the beginning.

 What do you wish people knew about prenups?

 Prenups are for everyone, not just the wealthy. There’s no “minimum” amount of money a person needs to have to get a prenup. They can protect existing wealth or future wealth or even protect against debt.

 They are also a tool for love, not divorce. During the prenup process, couples are required to dig into the tough questions about money, marriage, divorce, and death. Questions about how money is managed during the marriage to family planning and more. Hashing out the answers to these questions builds trust in the relationship, setting a solid foundation for the marriage. After the prenup process is over, 83% of HelloPrenup couples said they actually felt closer together than ever before. T

 What type of clientele uses HelloPrenup?

 HelloPrenup supports an incredibly diverse range of customers, from couples navigating student loans or personal debt to celebrities and high-profile business owners. We have even had users with over $100 million in inheritance, $1B in overall wealth, and even people with millions in debt (yes, millions).

 You have some big names involved in HelloPrenup, from investors to advisers to podcast guests. Tell us more.

 We’ve been backed by some of the most influential minds in family law, legal tech, finance,and consumer platforms. In addition to the recent funding from The Legal Tech Fund, our elite group of investors and advisors consists of Kevin O’Leary, Founder of Nextdoor Nirav Toli, Founder of LegalZoom Brian Liu, and Celebrity Divorce Attorney Laura Wasser.

 On our own The HelloPrenup Podcast, we’ve had the privilege of speaking with notable guests, ranging from respected family law attorneys to relationship coaches to celebrities like The Bachelor’s Ben Higgins. We discuss how to navigate conversations around finances, debt, assets and long-term goals within relationships. We’re grateful that so many people see the value in what we’re doing.

 What does the recent strategic investment from The LegalTech Fund mean for the future of HelloPrenup?

 The recent investment from LegalTech Fund will allow HelloPrenup to expand its coverage into all 50 states and international markets, as well as implement additional legal and relationship tech products to serve a larger market. It will also help us build strategic partnerships across financial institutions, wealth managers, and legal networks while enhancing our proprietary AI-driven contract optimization and legal education tools.

 We’ll also be able to scale our public service initiative with Suffolk University Law School—my alma mater—to help solve one of the legal system’s biggest challenges: the majority of Americans who do not have access to affordable legal services.
