# From Spirit Animals to Epigenetics: Inside K’Alma and Leaf Spas’ Spa Month Experience

In an industry often defined by luxury and aesthetics, K’Alma Spa and Leaf Spa are taking a different route: one that fuses ancestral healing traditions with next-generation personalization and it’s proving to be a compelling strategy for standing out during Miami Spa Month.

 This city-wide initiative, organized by the Greater Miami Convention & Visitors Bureau (GMCVB), runs July through August and invites residents and visitors to explore the city’s top wellness offerings at special rates. For K’Alma and Leaf, the campaign serves as a powerful platform to introduce their transformational, culturally rooted treatments to a broader audience.

 Business Innovation Meets Ancestral Wisdom

 Located inside the historic Victor Hotel on Ocean Drive, K’Alma Spa invites guests to start their visit with a Spirit Animal quiz – a whimsical yet energetically attuned tool that reveals a guest’s archetypal guide (think dolphin, owl, or lion). Treatments are then customized around that energy, often incorporating Peruvian healing elements like chakra crystals, native textiles, and herbal smudging ceremonies.

 Leaf Spa, nestled in the tranquil Hotel AKA Brickell, leans into bio-individualized wellness. Guests can opt for epigenetic testing (a $199 add-on, compared to $500+ industry rates) to create bespoke treatments aligned with their biological makeup. The offerings combine traditional modalities with wellness tech such as infrared saunas, hydrotherapy tubs, and guided meditations.

 

 “Every experience is designed to help you find your why—so you can align with your what,” says Contreras.

 Maximizing a City-Wide Wellness Campaign

 Miami Spa Month presents more than great deals during the slow season, it’s also a strategic entry point for new audiences. By offering packages that typically retail for double or triple the price, K’Alma and Leaf are not discounting their value, but investing in future client relationships.

 Signature journeys during Spa Month include:

 * Restore: For inflammation, fatigue, and joint pain relief
* Renew: A detox-focused ritual that stimulates lymphatic flow
* Rejuvenate: A longevity experience designed for cellular regeneration and collagen support

 Healing through Heritage

 What truly sets these brands apart is their commitment to cultural storytelling. Both spas source elements from Contreras’ Peruvian heritage, including hand-harvested teas from Cusco and shamanic rituals adapted for contemporary settings. It’s a model that resonates not only with conscious consumers, but also with the growing demand for wellness experiences that go beyond the superficial.
