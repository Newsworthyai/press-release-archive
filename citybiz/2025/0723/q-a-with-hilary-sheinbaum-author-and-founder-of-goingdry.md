# Q&amp;A with Hilary Sheinbaum, Author and Founder of GoingDry

Hilary Sheinbaum is a journalist, the founder of GoingDry.co and the author of The Dry Challenge: How to Lose the Booze for Dry January, Sober October, and Any Other Alcohol-Free Month (HarperCollins, 2020), a judgment-free guide to giving up alcohol for a month-long period.

 Can you share your background? What led you to write Going Dry?

 Nearly 10 years ago, I was working as a red carpet reporter interviewing celebs at movie premieres/fashion week/album release parties, attending VIP events and going to after parties with open bars filled with top shelf liquor. Because my entertainment gig was at night, I would freelance during the day for publications such as USA Today, Eater, Thirsty Mag, Forbes and amNew York — mostly writing about food and beverage. Alcohol was part of my job, not to mention being in my 20s, dating, and living in New York City. I wasn’t drinking every night but probably 2-3 times a week, some weeks. On New Years Eve 2016, while I was tipsy, I made a silly bet with one of my guy friends. We were eager to see who could accomplish a Dry January. In short: at midnight, I put down my glass of bubbly and in the end: I ended up winning our bet: no wine/beer/spirits for 31 days. It has led me to continue the tradition every year since. This January will be my 10th Dry January! Our bet inspired my first book “The Dry Challenge” (HarperCollins, 2020) and my latest book “Going Dry: A Workbook” (Quarto, 2024).

 How did you get involved with Giesen?

 I started collaborating with Giesen a few years ago after trying one of their NA white wines — which I loved. I really admire their commitment to and range of nonalcoholic offerings. We’ve worked on a few events together since, and I love that they continue to be innovative in the space (and delicious!)

 What is unique about Giesen’s NA offering and the new 0% Spritz?

 I think it’s pretty unique that Giesen has such a range of nonalcoholic options. Typically there are traditional wine brands (or even NA-only brands) that offer a few SKUs, but Giesen has really been at the forefront of creating great-tasting alcohol-removed wines, which isn’t just admirable, it’s hard to do! The new 0% Spritz is at the forefront of a category. If you want to drink a NA wine spritz, in general, you have to mix a few NA ingredients to create it (or buy a NA spritz cocktail in a can). With Giesen 0% Spritz, you can just open the glass bottle and pour.

 What are the benefits of substituting alcohol for lower ABV or NA drinks?

 There are so many benefits to drinking low and no ABV beverages. For one, drinking less can help improve sleep, digestion, mood, and energy levels. Additionally, NA beverages typically have fewer calories than those with alcohol, so if weight loss is a goal of yours, sipping a NA wine is much friendlier to your waistline!

 What is the opportunity for growth in the NA space?

 People are more health and wellness conscious now than ever before and Gen Z is also drinking less than older generations. With that, I think there are so many more consumers each day that are looking for alternatives to alcohol, and the space has grown so much in the last few years. Every day, it seems there’s a new nonalcoholic beverage hitting the market. So many people want to sip their favorite drink, but without worrying about any potential negatives that might transpire (hangovers, munchies, etc.).

 Anything else you would like to share?

 I think everyone should try a dry month. It doesn’t have to be January. It doesn’t have to start on the first of the month. And it doesn’t have to be a forever thing. But, I think giving up alcohol for 29-31 days can have a huge impact on physical health, mental health, financial savings, dating, social life and more. Needless to say, it changed so much for me in the best ways possible.
