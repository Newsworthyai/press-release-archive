# Boca Helping Hands Bowling for Bread will Support the BHH Backpacks Weekend Meal Program

Boca Helping Hands (BHH) will hold its annual Bowling for Bread event on Sunday, August 24 from noon to 2:00 p.m. at Lucky Strike, 21046 Commercial Trail, Boca Raton. BHH brings kids from local children’s charities to attend at no cost to enjoy an afternoon of bowling, food, and fun. Proceeds from the event will support the BHH Backpacks weekend meal program for kids in area schools.

 The children’s charities invited to participate include 4KIDS of South Florida, Inc., Achievement Centers for Children & Families, Adopt a Family of the Palm Beaches, Inc., American Association of Caregiving Youth, Boys & Girls Club of Boca Raton, Family Promise of South Palm Beach County, Fuller Center, HomeSafe, Place of Hope, PROPEL, and Pearl City Cats.

 Members of the community are encouraged to sponsor a child for $100, sponsor a lane for one of the children’s charities for $500, or make a donation of any size to support the Backpack program to feed kids in our area schools.

 

 Boca Helping Hands has operated the BHH Backpacks children’s meal program for the past 14 years, providing food-insecure students with non-perishable, easy-to-prepare meals every Friday to ensure they get enough to eat on the weekends. During the 2023-24 school year, BHH Backpacks helped over 1,100 students in 13 local schools, providing 181,362 meals and 60,454 snacks to elementary students in Boca Raton, Delray Beach, and Boynton Beach.

 Bowling for Bread is part of Boca Chamber Festival Days—a series of fun-filled August events intended to raise awareness and funds by pairing nonprofits with for-profit members of the Greater Boca Raton Chamber of Commerce. Ovation Home Insurance Exchange is Bowling for Bread’s For-Profit Chamber Partner, and the Event Sponsor is the Lee Pearlson Steinberg Foundation. Other major sponsors include the Gary Peters Family Foundation, and Humana Heathy Horizons in Florida.

 This is the Lee Pearlson Steinberg Foundation’s fourteenth year sponsoring the event. “Being part of the fun at Bowling for Bread and seeing the kids enjoy themselves is something I look forward to every year, “said Foundation Trustee Lee Steinberg. “My mom Pearl’s love for children’s causes inspired me to support Bowling for Bread in her memory. It’s a wonderful way to honor her legacy.”
