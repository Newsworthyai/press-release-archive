# Experienced Healthcare Professional Opens FYZICAL Clinic in Glendale, Focused on Fall Prevention and Mobility

FYZICAL Therapy & Balance Centers, the nation’s fastest-growing physical therapy franchise, is now open in Downtown Glendale at 5957 W. Northern Ave., Suite 117.

 The new center is locally owned and led by Melissa Sarhan, an Advanced Practice Registered Nurse with more than two decades of experience caring for adults and seniors. A member of the Obesity Medicine Association, Melissa has spent her career focused on helping people take control of their health and live life on their own terms.

 FYZICAL Therapy & Balance Centers is dedicated to enhancing patients’ quality of life through a comprehensive, personalized approach. By combining advanced techniques, state-of-the-art technology, and open communication, their physical therapists create tailored treatment plans to address the root causes of pain and dysfunction. The goal is not only to treat symptoms, but also to empower patients with the knowledge and tools to prevent future issues and love their life.

 Throughout her career, Sarhan saw a critical gap in the industry: a lack of proactive care to prevent falls. Too often, treatment focused on recovery after the fact. Opening her own FYZICAL location gave her the opportunity to break that cycle and focus on prevention.

 “Throughout my career, I’ve seen firsthand how many people underestimate their risk for falls. By opening FYZICAL, I can offer proactive care to help people avoid these risks before they become serious. We’re not just helping people recover from injuries—we’re focused on empowering them to stay active, independent, and confident every day.”

 Also on the team is Sam Arrow, a Doctor of Physical Therapy with extensive experience in outpatient orthopedic settings and a specialization in pelvic health. Their clinical interests include working with gender-expansive individuals, as well as those navigating chronic pain and connective tissue disorders. Arrow is committed to creating a therapeutic environment where patients feel seen, supported, and empowered as they work together to find what best serves their bodies and goals.

 The opening of FYZICAL in Glendale marks the next step in the brand’s continued expansion. For more information on FYZICAL Downtown Glendale, please visit fyzical.com/downtown-glendale-az, email downtownglendale@fyzical.com, or call (623)306-7893.
