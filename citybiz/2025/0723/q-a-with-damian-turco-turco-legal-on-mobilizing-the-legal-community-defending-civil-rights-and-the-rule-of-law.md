 In the face of growing threats to civil rights and the integrity of our legal system, Massachusetts attorneys are stepping up with urgency and unity. We spoke with Damian Turco, Founder of boutique family law firm, Turco Legal, P.C., Immediate Past President of the Massachusetts Bar Association and Board Member of Lawyers for Civil Rights (LCR), about his role in spearheading a powerful statewide legal initiative. From organizing a major event that galvanized hundreds of lawyers to boldly pledging 10% of his firm’s profits to LCR, Turco shares what drove his efforts, what’s next, and why now is the time for the legal community to lead with conviction.

 What were the biggest takeaways or themes that emerged from the civil rights and rule of law event you recently organized? Were there any moments that particularly stood out to you?

 The sheer number of attendees from the legal community was so encouraging. Our theory is that there is great support from the substantial majority of the legal community, particularly in Massachusetts, for the preservation of civil rights and the need to protect the rule of law. We were repeatedly surprised in the days leading up to the program by the number of registrations we received. Massachusetts is a great place to practice, and it’s gratifying to see so many people showing up.

 The audience—made up mostly of practicing attorneys across the legal industry—showed up with urgency, ready to help the cause. That was the best part. They were totally engaged and ready to help.

 You brought together a broad and diverse coalition of bar associations across Massachusetts in a powerful show of unity. What do you hope this kind of collaboration leads to in terms of next steps or long-term impact?

 The legal community is largely made up of hard-working, highly educated professionals who have dedicated their careers to helping people with the most complex problems. Yes, litigation is an adversarial system by design, but when something meaningful requires the expertise of lawyers, they tend to step up and help—even if they’re not getting paid.

 What made the program so successful was that we made it quick and easy for lawyers to get up to speed on the issues, volunteer, and make a donation—and then we spread the word far and wide. The need to advocate for the preservation of civil rights and the rule of law isn’t going away. Where and how we need to focus will evolve in the weeks and months ahead, and we intend to continue building our coalition of partners through engaging discussions with the community.

 As a Board Member of Lawyers for Civil Rights, what drew you to get involved with the organization, and how does it align with your personal and professional values?

 You might think only civil rights lawyers and activists would want to get involved in the leadership of a civil rights organization. The truth is, every lawyer has been extensively schooled on the importance of the civil rights we enjoy. We’ve made incredible progress in establishing and preserving protections under both federal and state law, including under the U.S. and Massachusetts Constitutions.

 Rule of law is even more basic—it simply means that we have laws, and they must be followed, or there are consequences. The fact that we refer to it as “rule of law” is a good example of how we sometimes mystify fundamental ideas by using legal terms. It’s not all that complicated—laws help keep order in the world. They are the rules of our society. Preserving the rule of law really just means advocating for the enforcement of the law so we can live and prosper with reliable norms.

 When the law is enforced arbitrarily—on the whim of one person—or when there is corruption, such as when people in power use arbitrary enforcement to benefit themselves, their families, and their allies, or to harm their opposition, our free society is threatened. Corruption and arbitrary enforcement are so much easier during times of great political polarization—and that’s exactly the environment we have today.

 You made a bold commitment by pledging 10% of your firm’s profits to support LCR’s mission. What inspired that decision, and what message do you hope it sends to other law firm leaders?

 It is bold, and it’s a more generous pledge than I’ve seen any other law firm of my size make. But it’s also the right thing to do. I’ve founded, built, evolved, and now manage the largest boutique family law firm in the state. We’re successful because we’re not afraid to try new things, take on new challenges, and stand up for what we believe in.

 Yes, we work hard, but we view ourselves as incredibly fortunate to have the drive to do so. With such fortune, we feel comes the responsibility to lead—to take on the greatest legal problems facing our world—and to do so with courage.

 I hope it catches people’s attention. I hope it inspires other lawyers to make their own bold pledges. I also hope we capture the attention of the legal community and that more business comes our way as a result, because that makes this a more sustainable pledge.

 I think being bold in this way can cause more people to think of their business—particularly when your values align on important issues. But it’s just one layer of Turco Legal’s credibility. First and foremost, we’re an excellent family law firm. We’re statewide in Massachusetts and in the process of expanding into New Hampshire as we continue to grow.

 We have an incredibly experienced team of attorneys, paralegals, and supporting administrative professionals. We do things other firms don’t do, often at rates lower than what other firms offer. We’ve scaled a limited-assistance reduced-fee program facilitated by our associate attorneys, while our most experienced senior attorneys and partners handle highly complex—and often contentious—matters.

 We don’t need to give 10% to Lawyers for Civil Rights to stand out in our field—we do it because we’re leaders.

 Looking ahead, how do you plan to keep the momentum going from this event? Are there future initiatives or partnerships already in the works?

 I’ve received a tremendous amount of positive feedback following the program, and there’s certainly an appetite for more as the landscape continues to evolve. We’ll likely do another legal community-focused event in a few months and are considering more public-facing educational programs in the meantime.

 We’re actively looking for more community partners. So, if you lead an organization whose membership would like a better sense of the present challenges to our freedoms and legal system, please reach out to me.
