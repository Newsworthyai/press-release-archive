# Resia Completes its First-Ever Project in the U.S., Utilizing Modular Bathrooms and Kitchens Built at its Off-Site, Manufacturing Facility in Georgia

Resia Golden Glades was constructed with prefabricated components of the highest quality, all while expediting construction and reducing costs across multiple verticals

 Resia, a leading housing platform specializing in the development, construction, and management of multifamily communities, unveiled its first fully-finished project in the U.S. utilizing bathrooms and kitchens built at its in-house manufacturing facility in Fairburn, GA, just south of Atlanta. The prefabricated components are inclusive of electrical and plumbing.

 Through Resia Manufacturing – which will shortly offer its modular bathroom and kitchen construction capabilities to the residential and hospitality industries – Resia constructed and launched Resia Golden Glades, a new-build, mid-rise residential community in Miami, Florida.

 Located at 550 Northwest 161st St., Resia Golden Glades features 420 thoughtfully designed apartments across four five-story buildings, offering a mix of one-, two-, and three-bedroom units. Each apartment is equipped with modern finishes, including open kitchen floorplans, granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, and in-unit washers and dryers. Residents will also enjoy private balconies or patios and stylish wood-inspired flooring.

 “Resia’s mission is to develop workforce housing communities that are not only attainable, but of highest quality,” said Ricardo Blas, Chief Operating Officer at Resia. “Communities like Resia Golden Glades fill a crucial role in South Florida’s severe housing affordability crisis.”

 Resia Manufacturing specializes in HybridFabrication for modular construction, producing high-quality, fully assembled, ready-to-install kitchen and bathroom components. The cutting-edge HybridFabrication process enables highly efficient production of components, complete with mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems.

 The process significantly reduces construction timelines because site work becomes a parallel process with the modular construction, versus having to complete the site work then start going vertical. With both processes occurring simultaneously, it exponentially increases efficiency. Quality control also increases while product waste decreases due to the exacting nature of the modular process.

 “Through modular design and robotics, we ensure that the complex construction of kitchens and bathrooms can be scaled, reducing labor costs, expediting timelines and allowing the delivery of the highest quality construction faster and more efficiently than traditional methods,” said Matt Tall, Vice President of Manufacturing and Operations at Resia. “Resia Golden Glades is an ideal example how technology does not only support construction, but actually makes the process more cost-effective, all while producing the highest quality product.”

 “We provide a comprehensive solution to the overall cost of construction through advanced technology that enables faster, more efficient creation of sustainable and affordable buildings,” adds Blas. “Our goal is to create high-quality, attainable housing that enhances the lifestyle of our residents with best-in-class amenities and a prime location.”

 Resia Golden Glades offers an array of amenities designed to elevate everyday living, including a state-of-the-art 24/7 fitness center, a swimming pool, a clubhouse, a playground, and a pet-friendly environment. Residents also benefit from a professional on-site management team, complimentary Wi-Fi in common areas, EV charging stations, and a mini market for added convenience. The community includes a 705-car parking garage, ensuring ample parking for residents and guests.

 Resia Golden Glades provides seamless connectivity to Miami’s top shopping, dining, and entertainment destinations. Whether commuting for work or exploring the vibrant city, residents will experience unmatched convenience and accessibility.

 Resia Golden Glades is now open for tours and can be scheduled at www.resiagoldenglades.com.
