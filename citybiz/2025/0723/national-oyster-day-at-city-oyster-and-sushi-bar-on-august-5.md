# National Oyster Day at City Oyster and Sushi Bar on August 5

There is no better place for mollusk lovers to be on National Oyster Day, August 5, than at City Oyster in Delray Beach.

 In honor of the slurp-worthy occasion, the celebrated half-shell haven will offer guests a complimentary glass of champagne with every order of a dozen oysters.

 City Oyster’s rotating oyster varieties include:

 The Fishing Chef

 Named after City Oyster’s executive chef, Jordan Stilley, the quintessential East Coast oyster possesses notes of ocean brine followed by a sweet and buttery smooth finish.

 Bluepoint

 Gracing oyster menus since the early 1800s, these famous Long Island favorites are beloved for their mild, subtle salty flavor.

 Wianno

 Hailing from Cape Cod, this cocktail oyster enjoys a cult following and offers a clean, crisp, salty-sweet flavor.

 Love Shuck

 Cultivated in the nutrient-rich waters of Maine’s Damariscotta River, these love-ly oysters combine a crisp, minerally brine with a sweet, fruity finish.

 Irish Point

 Hailing from Canada (eh!), these vibrant green gems start off with a sweet, briny and slightly salty kiss and pair perfectly with a crisp Chardonnay or hoppy IPA.

 Kumamoto

 Originally from Japan, these small yet meaty bivalves are prided for their silky sweet, buttery flavor, and clean, briny finish with subtle fruity notes.

 City Oyster & Sushi Bar is located at 213 E. Atlantic Ave., Delray Beach. For more information, call (561) 272- 0220 or visit cityoysterdelray.com.
