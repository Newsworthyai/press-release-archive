# Evolution Credit Partners Surpasses $1B In Credit Protection as Companies Seek Alternatives to Traditional Trade Credit Insurance

Evolution Credit Partners Management, LLC, a leading provider of single buyer, non-cancellable Trade Credit Protection for accounts receivable from high-yield buyers, today announced it has delivered more than $1 billion in protection since launching its TCP business in late 2020.

 Evolution’s TCP program addresses a persistent gap in the trade finance market—offering tailored credit protection solutions for companies often unable to secure them through traditional credit insurance or factoring channels. The Firm’s customized approach continues to attract suppliers, banks, and factors seeking flexible, responsive protection for transactions involving below-investment-grade buyers.

 This milestone comes amid a growing demand for alternative trade credit solutions, as companies grapple with shifting supply chains, rising tariffs, and constrained risk appetite from traditional insurers. With high-yield buyer risk rising and liquidity tightening across global markets, Evolution’s bespoke TCP offering has emerged as a timely tool for mitigating counterparty risk and preserving working capital.

 “Our TCP platform was designed to meet the needs of underserved market participants,” said Rene Canezin, Co-Founder of Evolution. “Crossing the $1 billion mark underscores the urgent demand for creative, credit-focused solutions and the trust our clients have placed in our team.”

 A recent example of Evolution’s impact is its ongoing support of Casas Bahia, a major retail chain in Brazil. In response to limited availability of traditional credit insurance, Evolution structured a large-scale customized TCP solution that allows Casas Bahia to maintain uninterrupted supply relationships with key global vendors.

 “Our solution has enabled Casas Bahia to continue purchasing essential inventory without disruption, while giving their suppliers the confidence and protection needed to sustain the relationship,” said Gary Tripp, who leads Evolution’s Trade Credit Protection business. “This is exactly the kind of partnership our platform was built to support.”

 Evolution’s single buyer, non-cancellable TCP offering expands well beyond conventional “vendor put” products, with features including:

 * Protection against both bankruptcy and non-payment events
* Protection for Preference
* Protection for Work in Progress
* Customizable monthly protection amounts
* Works with existing credit insurance to match supplier’s full needs
* Extension flexibility to match evolving trade exposure timelines

 By combining its expertise in leveraged finance and trade finance, Evolution delivers hybrid solutions that help clients manage risk, enhance liquidity, and grow confidently—even in uncertain market environments.
