# There’s Power in Every Action: Feeding South Florida Launches Hunger Action Month This September

Feeding South Florida® – the leading hunger-relief organization serving Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade, and Monroe counties – is commemorating Hunger Action Month this September with various activities to encourage South Floridians to “Go Orange” to stand against hunger. Hunger Action Month, a nationwide initiative created by Feeding America®, takes place throughout September and is designed to raise awareness about the issue of hunger in America and inspire others to take action toward ending it. This year, Feeding South Florida’s theme is “Power in Every Action.”

 Currently, in South Florida, there are more than 1.2 million food-insecure individuals. One in nine individuals in South Florida remains uncertain about where they will get their next meal due to inflation, the strained supply chain, rising fuel prices, and increased housing costs, among other factors. Proceeds raised during the month-long initiative will allow Feeding South Florida to fulfill its mission to end hunger in South Florida by providing immediate access to nutritious food, leading hunger and poverty advocacy efforts, and transforming lives through innovative programming and education.

 An online auction during the month will allow bidders access to fun, unique items while supporting Feeding South Florida’s hunger relief efforts. “Hunger Heroes” t-shirts will be available for purchase to raise awareness about hunger. Monetary donations will go further during September with a Hunger Action Match, all month long donations will be matched dollar-for-dollar, up to $25,000. Every donation is critical, as a $1 donation allows Feeding South Florida to provide approximately four meals to a family in need.

 During Hunger Action Month, South Floridians can “Go Orange” by participating in various activities throughout the month, including:

 * Start a Fund Drive: Raise money with coworkers, friends and family online.
* Start a Food Drive: Feeding South Florida relies on the generous support of the community to host food drives to ensure it receives shelf-stable, high-demand products.
* Dine at Participating Restaurants: A portion of the meal will help feed local families.
* Hunger Action Day (Sept. 9): Feeding South Florida celebrates Hunger Action Day, also known as “GO ORANGE DAY.” The community is invited to purchase a “Hunger Heroes” t-shirt for $30 and wear it to support ending hunger in South Florida by visiting feedingsouthflorida.org/ham2025.
* Pack to Give Back – Corporate Teams (Sept. 12): Companies are encouraged to volunteer to sort food and pack meal boxes for families at one of Feeding South Florida’s warehouses. Shifts include 8:30-11:30 a.m. and 1:30-4:30 p.m.
* Participate in the 2025 Outrun Hunger 5K – Palm Beach County: (7:30 a.m. on Saturday, Sept. 20) Participants can raise funds for Feeding South Florida by running or walking during this fun-filled event taking place at the beautiful Okeeheelee Park (7715 Forest Hill Blvd., West Palm Beach, FL 33413). Participants can join the event as an individual or a team.
* Volunteer: During Hunger Action Month, coworkers, family and friends are invited to volunteer to sort food at one of Feeding South Florida’s warehouses or help prepare and cook meals for children and seniors at Feeding South Florida’s 5,000-square-foot state-of-the-art multi-purpose Community Kitchen in Boynton Beach.

Throughout the month, individuals can host an orange bake sale, government and municipalities can issue a proclamation for Hunger Action Month, hotels can welcome guests with an in-room display that showcases Hunger Action Month, schools can develop students’ skills by creating a project to promote hunger awareness and much more.
