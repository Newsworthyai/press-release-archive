Confirming demand for office space from growing firms, JLL announced today that it has secured new office leases with international labor and employment law firm Fisher Phillips LLP in downtown Los Angeles and Woodland Hills, California. The firm signed a new 35,744-square-foot lease at 515 South Flower Street in Los Angeles. Additionally, the firm signed a new 13,624-square foot lease at 21600 Oxnard Street in Woodland Hills, California.

 “Southern California has been our home for a long time, and our roots here run deep,” said Todd Scherwin, Regional Managing Partner at Fisher Phillips. “Since establishing our presence in Los Angeles in 2011, we’ve had the privilege of serving countless clients and have seen demand for our labor and employment services increase year after year. These new office spaces in Los Angeles and Woodland Hills are more than just a larger footprint; they reaffirm our commitment to the businesses and individuals who trust us. They are also pivotal to our dedication to attracting and retaining the very best legal talent, ensuring we continue to provide the exceptional service our clients have come to expect from a firm with such a rich history in California.”

 With over 675 attorneys in 45 offices across the United States, Mexico and Japan, Fisher Phillips is an international labor and employment firm providing practical business solutions for employers’ workplace legal problems. The firm regularly advises and counsels clients on issues surrounding wage and hour, employment discrimination and harassment, litigation, workplace safety, immigration, trade secrets and non-competes, and more.

 JLL’s Jim Schoolfield and Kevin Bender represented Fisher & Phillips in the two leases. For the deal on Flower Street landlord Commonwealth Partners was represented in-house by John Bendetti. For the lease on Oxnard Street landlord Douglas Emmett was represented in-house by Ali Mourad.

 “While LA office leasing volume has been slow, we continue to see thriving firms like Fisher & Phillips expand and add offices to meet the needs of its customers,” said Jim Schoolfield, JLL Managing Director. “Downtown Los Angeles and Woodland Hills are integral markets to the growth of the company.”

 Bender went on to say “We have seen a flight to quality with law firms and companies in other sectors when it comes to office leasing in Los Angeles. The physical office space, tenant experience, amenities and location play an integral role in getting employees into the office.”
