# Rosso Commercial Arranges Sale of 30,731 SF “West Court” Medical-Office Building in Annapolis for $3.7M

Rosso Commercial Real Estate Services announces the successful sale of 2448 Holly Avenue (aka “West Court”), a 4-story, 30,731-square-foot medical and professional office building located in the heart of Annapolis’ Town Centre district.

 Situated just off West Street with immediate access to Route 2, Route 50, and I-97, the asset offered a unique opportunity for both investors and owner-users seeking a high-visibility, centrally located property in Anne Arundel County.

 Over the past eight years, Ryan Brassel, SIOR and John Rosso, SIOR of RossoCRE represented the property as leasing agents, completing numerous medical and office tenant leases. As the existing property loan approached maturity, ownership made the strategic decision to sell and engaged RossoCRE to handle the process. Brassel and Rosso shifted focus and executed a targeted marketing campaign, ultimately identifying a qualified 1031 exchange buyer and closing the transaction for $3.7 million on July 22, 2025.

 “This transaction reflects the continued demand for well-located, adaptable office buildings in Annapolis MD.” said Ryan Brassel, SIOR, Principal at RossoCRE. “It’s especially rewarding to see a long-term leasing assignment evolve into a successful investment sale — a full life-cycle for the listing”

 RossoCRE represented the seller, while Dom Digiovannantonio & Rob Freedman of JLL represented the buyer. The property was approximately 50% leased at the time of sale and offers immediate occupancy potential of up to 15,000 square feet – a prime opportunity for large-format medical or office users.

 The building’s location, flexible zoning, signage opportunities, and abundant parking ratio made it attractive to investors and users alike. Its proximity to Annapolis Towne Centre, the regional hospital, and major commuting routes added to its marketability. This transaction propels RossoCRE’s 2025 total sales volume beyond $30 million, complementing the firm’s impressive leasing activity, which has already surpassed $45 million year-to-date.
