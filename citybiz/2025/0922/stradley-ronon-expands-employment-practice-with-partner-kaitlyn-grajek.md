# Stradley Ronon Expands Employment Practice With Partner Kaitlyn Grajek

Stradley Ronon has strengthened its employment practice with the addition of Kaitlyn Grajek as a partner in the firm’s Newark and New York offices. Arriving from Freeman Mathis & Gary, where she served as a leader of the Northeast Employment practice team, Kaitlyn provides strategic guidance to clients on complex employment law issues and defends employers in a broad range of cases in courts and administrative proceedings.

 “Kaitlyn combines proactive counseling and vigorous defense to guide employers through complex workplace challenges,” said Melanie Ronen, partner and chair of the firm’s employment practice. “Kaitlyn will be a key member of our bi-coastal practice in supporting our clients’ employment-related legal needs.”

 Kaitlyn regularly represents employers across multiple industries in matters involving discrimination, retaliation, harassment, medical leave claims, wage and hour claims, whistleblower actions, and professional liability. She is well-versed in handling restrictive covenant disputes, including the enforcement and defense of non-compete, non-solicitation and confidentiality agreements.

 In her practice, Kaitlyn also assists clients with the drafting and review of non-compete and related agreements. She counsels employers in connection with workplace best practices, including workplace policies, compliance and risk mitigation.

 “I’m thrilled to join Stradley Ronon’s national platform and collaborate with such a talented team,” Kaitlyn said. “Guiding clients through high-stakes matters and earning their trust is incredibly rewarding, and I look forward to contributing to the firm’s continued growth and success.”
