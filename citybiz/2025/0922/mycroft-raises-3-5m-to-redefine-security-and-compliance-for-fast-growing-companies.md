# Mycroft Raises $3.5M to Redefine Security and Compliance for Fast-Growing Companies

Startups and scaling organizations face mounting pressure to meet enterprise-grade security and compliance standards long before they have the resources to build dedicated teams. Mycroft has emerged to solve that gap, announcing today a USD $3.5 million seed round to bring its AI-driven Security and Compliance Officer to more companies.

 Mycroft replaces scattered tools and manual processes with an agentic AI system that continuously monitors infrastructure, secures devices, enforces policies, manages incidents, and prepares companies for audits. Acting like a dedicated teammate rather than another software tool, its AI agents adapt to each company’s environment and take action automatically. This level of round-the-clock monitoring and support provides businesses confidence that their security posture is always up to date.

 Security and compliance have become bloated, expensive, and disconnected from how companies actually operate. Mycroft replaces scattered tools, manual workflows, and spreadsheet-driven audits with a single agentic AI solution that acts as a Security and Compliance Officer. It continuously monitors cloud infrastructure, secures devices, enforces policies, manages incidents, and prepares companies for audits, all from one interface. Under the hood, no-code AI agents handle complex tasks automatically, adapting to each company’s environment – it’s your virtual CISO, GRC expert, and IT ops team, all rolled into one. The result is a system that feels less like software and more like a teammate – always on, always learning, and always ready.

 “Throughout my career, I’ve experienced firsthand how short-staffed security and compliance teams can be,” said Mike Kim, Co-founder and CEO of Mycroft. “It fueled my desire to build a platform that could supercharge those lean teams that serve such a critical function. For many companies, particularly those building on emerging technologies or working in secure sectors, the surface attack areas are getting bigger and bigger, at a much faster rate. With Mycroft, any sized organization can achieve enterprise security from day 1.”

 Mycroft already supports more than 50 customers, including fast-growing companies such as Superwhisper, Evolo, CoVet, Unified, Willful, Wisedocs, and Weave (YC25). The round was led by Luge Capital, with participation from Brightspark Ventures and Graphite Ventures, alongside Ripple Ventures, Developer Capital, Antler, BoxOne Ventures, and strategic angels. Mycroft will use the capital to expand its AI’s agentic capabilities and equip their Security and Compliance agents with more tools to work with.
