# Pun and Games: One-Liner Pro Andy Huggins Brings the Laughs to Boca

Sometimes all it takes is a single line to bring the house down…and Andy Huggins has a whole night’s worth ready for Boca. Huggins, the master of the razor-sharp one-liner, will take the stage at The Studio at Mizner Park for one night only on Saturday, October 18, 2025, at 7:30 PM (doors open at 6:30 PM). Tickets are $25–$69.

 Known for his quick wit and perfectly timed punchlines, Huggins is a true comedy veteran. He was one of the original Texas Outlaw Comics alongside Sam Kinison and Bill Hicks, and his career spans clubs, late-night stages, and television appearances. He gained national attention on NBC’s America’s Got Talent, earning rave reviews for his clever style and delivery, and continues to reach new audiences with his sharp, hilarious takes on life via his fast-growing TikTok following.

 Despite decades in the business, Huggins shows no signs of slowing down. Whether he’s poking fun at the quirks of everyday life or delivering a knockout one-liner, his comedy proves that humor truly is timeless.
