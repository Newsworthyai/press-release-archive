# JSerra Catholic High School Hosts Adelante Fest 2025 Featuring Author &amp; Motivational Speaker Immaculée Ilibagiza

JSerra Catholic High School is proud to announce Adelante Fest 2025, an inspiring evening open to the community featuring internationally acclaimed author and motivational speaker, Immaculée Ilibagiza, a survivor of the Rwandan genocide. The event will take place on Saturday, October 11, 2025, beginning with Vigil Mass at 4:00 p.m., followed by the festival from 5:00 to 8:30 p.m. on the JSerra campus.

 “Adelante Fest is more than just an event. It’s an encounter with faith, a building up of community, and a transformational experience,” said Patrick Reidy, Vice President of Mission & Faith at JSerra Catholic High School. “Immaculée Ilibagiza’s presence on campus will give students, families, and the wider public a compelling and living example of the power of forgiveness and Christian hope in the face of the most unthinkable suffering.”

 Immaculée survived the 1994 Rwandan genocide by hiding in a 3×4-foot bathroom for 91 days with seven other women. Despite enduring unimaginable fear and loss, she has transformed her experience into a powerful message of hope, forgiveness and reconciliation. Today, she travels the world inspiring audiences to overcome fear, doubt and hate.

 In addition to the keynote address, Adelante Fest attendees can enjoy interactive photo booths, bounce houses, field games, face painting, and more. Tickets for the festival are on sale at jserra.simpletix.com, with general admission priced at $15 for adults and $10 for children.
