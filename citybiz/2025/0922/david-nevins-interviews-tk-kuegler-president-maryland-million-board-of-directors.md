# David Nevins Interviews TK Kuegler, President, Maryland Million Board of Directors

TK is the Founder and Managing Partner at Wasabi Ventures Stallions. His job is to steer the business and investment aspect of the breeding operation working. It has been his lifelong dream to build a world-class thoroughbred operation. In 2017, TK started Wasabi Ventures Stables as the first aspect of this dream. The creation and launching of Wasabi Ventures Stallions in 2019, with the purchase and standing of Force the Pass and then the subsequent 5X ROI sale of the stallion in 2020, has led to the expansion of Stallions as an entity.

 Since hearing the stories of his great grandfather about the racing business in the 50s and 60s, he has romantically dreamt of making a stable a reality. After a career in the startup world wherein he has been a part of over 1,500 rounds of financing as an investor, founder, or adviser, he decided to bring a lot of that experience to the racing industry.
