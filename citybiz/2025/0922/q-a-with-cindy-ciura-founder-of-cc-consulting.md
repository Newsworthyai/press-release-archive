As she marks this milestone, she reflects on her journey, the shifting retail landscape, and what lies ahead for CC Consulting.

 Congratulations on 20 years of CC Consulting. Looking back, what inspired you to launch the firm in 2005, and what was your vision at that time?

 Thank you! It’s hard to believe it’s been 20 years. When I founded CC Consulting in the summer of 2005, it was after navigating a couple of pivotal and formative experiences in my career. I had been working at a company for several years, and while I was in a leadership role, I encountered some challenges related to workplace dynamics and culture that made me reflect on the kind of environment I wanted to be part of and help create for others.

 I then accepted a role as Vice President at the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation, which was an exciting opportunity. However, that period also came with its own set of complexities, especially given the political and business landscape at the time.

 What both of those experiences reinforced for me was the importance of integrity, purpose, and creating a positive impact through your work. I had already spent 16 years in the industry and was passionate about the field. Rather than step away, I saw an opportunity to build something of my own, which was an organization where I could channel my values, experience, and vision into meaningful work. That’s what led to the creation of CC Consulting.

 Your firm has worked on some of the most desirable shopping districts. What have been some of your most memorable or game-changing projects over the last two decades?

 You’re right, I’ve worked in some amazing areas. There have been quite a few memorable projects.

 I’ll start close to home with downtown Birmingham, Michigan. I’ve worked there for about 10 years. When I started, they didn’t have the level of national retail representation they wanted. Today, downtown Birmingham is thriving with national brands. I’ll take partial credit for that, and I’m still working there, bringing in amazing tenants. In fact, there will be some outstanding new announcements coming in the next few weeks.

 In Detroit, I’ve been working for more than 25 years, since before I started my own company. Back then, there was very little national retail presence in the city. It was mostly restaurants and mom-and-pop shops. When I worked with the Schostak Brothers, we brought in the Hard Rock Cafe and Borders Books to the Compuware Building. Those were some of the first national retailers in downtown Detroit. That helped start the momentum, and now you see many more national brands throughout the city.

 Outside of Michigan, I am extremely involved in the Florida market, especially Orlando and Naples where I continue to strengthen tenant mixes on select properties. It’s a wealthy market, and we’re bringing in new national and luxury retailers.

 I’ve also worked in Palm Beach, the Carolinas, California, Ohio, Chicago and New York City. In each of these places, the projects have focused on bringing in retail that wasn’t previously represented. That’s what excites me—revitalizing cities, streets, and malls with fresh retail offerings. It really does make a difference who the tenants are.

 Before you started CC Consulting, you held executive positions with some of the biggest names in the industry. How did those roles shape your approach as a founder and consultant?

 I truly couldn’t be more fortunate. I count my blessings.

 I worked for The Forbes Company, when Sid Forbes was very involved. I consider him a mentor. I also worked with Olympia Development under Atanas Ilitch and had many interactions with Mike Ilitch himself—an icon in our industry for his work in food, sports, and more. The lessons I learned from him were invaluable.

 Lastly, Bob Schostak of Schostak Brothers & Company was instrumental in projects like the Campus Martius development and owned more than 50 properties around the country.

 Having these three mentors, the Forbes family, the Ilitches, and the Schostaks, gave me an incredible foundation. I couldn’t have asked for a better background to launch my own company.

 Retail has evolved tremendously since 2005. How has your work in attraction and tenant mix strategy changed, and what trends are shaping the next decade?

 Here’s the thing—so many people love to say, “Retail is dead. Everyone’s shopping on Amazon. Brick-and-mortar is over.” That couldn’t be further from the truth.

 There are more retailers, both domestic and international, actively looking for space now than ever before. Retail is a tactile experience. People still love to shop in person. They love the entertainment of it. And that demand is still very real.

 The good news is that retailers are still opening brick-and-mortar locations. In fact, I can honestly say that I’ve never been busier in the 20 years of running my company. Yes, people buy more online and through social media now, but that hasn’t slowed the search for physical retail locations.

 CC Consulting is known for attracting high-end and luxury brands to high-street properties. What’s the key to successfully building a desirable retail tenant mix in today’s competitive market?

 One reason clients hire me is my long-standing relationships with retailers—some going back 20 years.

 Retailers have a bit of a herd mentality. If Joe is coming, Peter and Carol want to come, too. Because of my relationships, I can bring multiple retailers to the table that may have an interest in a particular market. That’s a huge advantage.

 Luxury tenants especially like to co-locate near other luxury retailers. So having those relationships and knowing how to curate the right tenant mix is what sets my company apart.

 Your work spans urban downtowns, smaller BIDs, and top-tier destinations coast to coast. How do you tailor your approach for such diverse markets?

 It all comes down to knowing the market. Retailers want to know everything about a location, whether it’s an urban center, an upscale mall, or a smaller BID.

 That’s where marketing materials become critically important. Everything from the data to the demographics must be customized for the location you’re promoting. My assistant Rob, who has been with me for 15 of the 20 years I’ve been in business, puts together our marketing packages. He understands retailers and what they need to see.

 My own background in marketing has also helped immensely. Presenting the project effectively is what gets retailers interested. It makes all the difference.

 What do you think has been the most rewarding part of growing CC Consulting into a national firm over the last 20 years?

 Two things really stand out.

 First, I’ve had the opportunity to speak at a variety of events, conferences, and meetings—even at Harvard. I love being able to share my knowledge, offer tips, and talk through real-life examples. That’s incredibly rewarding.

 Second, and equally important, is giving back. I was raised to believe it’s vital to contribute to your community. As successful as my company has been, I dedicate a lot of time to nonprofit work.

 I sit on the Board of Directors of Michigan Humane. Animal welfare has been a lifelong passion. I’ve worked with lawmakers to change laws and helped rescue stray animals during redevelopment projects like District Detroit.

 I’m also involved with Catholic Charities, which is converting old elementary schools in Detroit into low-cost housing for the homeless. I try to use my professional talents to help worthy causes, and that’s something I’m very proud of.

 As you look ahead to the future of your company, what’s next on the horizon? Any markets, goals, or projects you’re especially excited about?

 Yes, absolutely!

 I’m starting to work in markets I haven’t touched before, which is very exciting. For instance, I’m taking on a project in Washington, D.C. I did some work there many years ago, but this will be my first recent engagement there.

 I also just landed a new client that handles retail for convention centers. That’s a completely new arena for me. It’s fascinating to think about who attends these conferences, what kind of retail appeals to them, and how to curate the right experience.

 So, I’m continuing to explore new venues within the retail world and I’m genuinely excited about what’s ahead.
