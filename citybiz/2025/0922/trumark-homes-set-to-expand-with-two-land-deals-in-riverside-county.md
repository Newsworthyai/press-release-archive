# Trumark Homes Set to Expand with Two Land Deals in Riverside County

* Solara in Temescal Valley and Florita in Corona will add more than 300 new homes
* Sites secured in high-demand market, reinforcing long-term investment in Southern California

 Trumark Homes, the award-winning Western U.S. homebuilder, announced today that it has purchased land for the development of two new residential communities in Riverside County. The deals will bring an additional 314 new homes to the area and extend the company’s strategic growth across Southern California.

 “Securing land in Southern California is increasingly competitive, and we are fortunate to have acquired two prime sites in such a high-demand market,” said Richard Douglass, Southern California Division President at Trumark Homes. “This investment reflects our long-term confidence in the region’s continued growth and reinforces our commitment to building high-quality communities that meet the needs of today’s buyers, including first-time homebuyers.”

 Solara in Temescal Valley will feature 224 single-family detached homes in two neighborhoods, Radiance and Horizon. Offering seven floor plans, homes will range from 2,679 square feet to 4,049 square feet, with three to five bedrooms, and two-and-a-half to five-and-a-half bathrooms.

 Florita in Corona will include two neighborhoods, Petal and Bloom, with a total of 90 single-family and townhomes combined. Petal will contain 44 townhomes with three floor plans ranging from 1,331 square feet to 1,733 square feet, with two to three bedrooms, and two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half bathrooms. Bloom will contain 46 single-family detached homes with three floor plans ranging from 1,246 square feet to 1,717 square feet, with three to four bedrooms, and two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half bathrooms.

 Located in Riverside, these two new home communities are surrounded by top-rated schools, restaurants and shopping, near Corona Lake and the Cleveland National Forest, and within convenient proximity to the 91 and I-15 freeways, enabling access to regional business centers and popular amenities.

 “Continuing our expansion throughout Southern California is a strategic and thoughtful process,” added Douglass. “We are fortunate to have an exceptional team actively focused on identifying future projects as we look to do our part in increasing much-needed housing inventory.”
