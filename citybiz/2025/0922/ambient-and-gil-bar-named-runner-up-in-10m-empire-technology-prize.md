# Ambient and Gil-Bar Named Runner-Up in $10M Empire Technology Prize

Ambient Enterprises, alongside Gil-Bar and Flow Environmental Systems, has been recognized as Runner-Up in the prestigious Empire Technology Prize, receiving a $100,000 award for their groundbreaking work in advancing clean heating solutions for New York State.

 The Empire Technology Prize, launched by The Clean Fight with support from NYSERDA, Wells Fargo, and RMI, is a $10 million initiative designed to accelerate the development and demonstration of novel clean heating technologies as alternatives to fossil fuel boilers. Over the past year, seven finalist teams—including Ambient, Gil-Bar, and Flow Environmental Systems—piloted solutions to reduce carbon emissions while ensuring scalable, reliable performance for New York’s buildings.

 A High-Impact Clean Heating Solution

 The Ambient–Gil-Bar–Flow team was recognized for its high-temperature hot water solution powered by a natural refrigerant (CO₂). This system not only delivers sustainable heating but also provides domestic hot water and simultaneous heating and cooling capabilities—making it a versatile and impactful decarbonization technology.

 A demonstration project of this solution is set to launch at Union Theological Seminary in Upper Manhattan, marking a major step toward proving the scalability and effectiveness of carbon-neutral heating systems in real-world applications.

 Recognition from New York State Leadership

 Governor Kathy Hochul announced the winners, highlighting the critical role these innovations play in advancing the state’s aggressive climate goals.

 * Runner-Up ($100K): Ambient, Gil-Bar, and Flow Environmental Systems.
* Honorable Mention: Johnson Controls for its cascaded cycle and mechanical vapor recompression solution.

 Driving New York’s Path to Decarbonization

 “New York has set one of the most ambitious paths toward decarbonization in the country. Being recognized in the Empire Technology Prize is proof of the strength of our partnerships, engineering expertise, and commitment to delivering scalable, real-world solutions,” said Chris Bisaccia, CEO of Ambient Enterprises.

 Tony Tanzillo, COO of Ambient, added: “This recognition underscores our shared mission to provide clean, practical HVAC solutions that meet the needs of building owners today while preparing New York for a carbon-free future.”

 About the Empire Technology Prize

 Created by The Clean Fight, the Empire Technology Prize awarded $4.15 million to support seven first-of-a-kind demonstration projects across New York State and an additional $4.75 million in milestone funding. Together, these projects represent a critical step toward building-wide decarbonization, offering building owners new options that are easier to adopt and deploy at scale.
