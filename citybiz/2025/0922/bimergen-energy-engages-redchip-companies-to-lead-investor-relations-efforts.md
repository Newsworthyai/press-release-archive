# Bimergen Energy Engages RedChip Companies to Lead Investor Relations Efforts

RedChip Companies, an international investor relations, media, and research firm, today announced that it has been engaged by Bimergen Energy Corporation, a developer of utility-scale battery energy storage projects and an independent power provider, to lead its investor relations efforts.

 “We are at a pivotal stage in our growth as we advance our 2.0 GW portfolio of battery energy storage system (BESS) projects,” stated Benjamin Tran, Bimergen Chairman and CEO. “With the surge in demand for energy storage driven by AI, electrification, and grid modernization, our projects are positioned to deliver contract-backed revenues and provide essential grid stability. Partnering with RedChip enables us to broaden our visibility among institutional and retail investors while communicating the significant long-term value we are building.”

 Dave Gentry, CEO of RedChip commented, “Bimergen Energy is uniquely positioned to capitalize on one of the fastest-growing segments of the renewable energy sector. Their robust pipeline, experienced leadership team, and commitment to stable, long-term revenue streams through institutional partnerships present a compelling story for investors. We look forward to delivering Bimergen’s message to our global audience through our integrated investor relations and media platform.”

 With U.S. data center power demand expected to double by 2030 and grid-scale battery storage capacity projected to grow at a 24% CAGR through the decade, Bimergen is well-positioned to capitalize on these powerful industry tailwinds.
