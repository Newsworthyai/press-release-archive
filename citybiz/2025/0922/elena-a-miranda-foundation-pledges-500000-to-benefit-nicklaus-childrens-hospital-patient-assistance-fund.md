# Elena A. Miranda Foundation Pledges $500,000 to Benefit Nicklaus Children’s Hospital Patient Assistance Fund

The Elena A. Miranda Foundation held a reception on Wednesday, September 17 at Nicklaus Children’s Hospital, Kenneth C. Griffin Surgical Tower to celebrate a significant recognition: a wing of the lobby being named the “Elena A. Miranda Marketplace.” The recognition was in honor of the foundation’s $500,000 donation to benefit the Patient Assistance Fund.

 Founded in 2023 by Carlos Fausto Miranda, founder and principal of Fausto Commercial, in honor of his late sister, the foundation’s mission is to raise funds to support underprivileged children facing life-threatening health issues where their families lack the financial means for medical intervention and where public funding is not available. All administrative costs are fully covered by dedicated donors, ensuring that 100% of every contribution goes directly to supported causes.

 “Because public funding is scarce, it’s vital that every dollar that enters the foundation goes into the hospital’s patience assistance fund to be used for life-saving medical treatment,” said Miranda.

Additional remarks were given by Miranda and Alejandro Mendieta, president of the Coastal Wealth Private Client Group and a board member of the foundation.

 “Anyone who has childhood memories of being on this campus, either undergoing treatment themselves or in my case that of my sibling, knows that it can be difficult to return,” Miranda said. “But by investing every dollar received, we strive to yield an intangible difference, to save a child’s life.”
