# Acclaimed Brand Strategist Ulli Appelbaum Releases ‘The Science of Brand Associations: Win Minds, Win Markets’ — The First Comprehensive, Evidence-Based Guide On How Truly Successful Brands Are Built

Why do some brands stick in our minds—and wallets—while others fade into irrelevance? According to internationally recognized brand strategist Ulli Appelbaum, the answer lies in a secret hiding in plain sight and one of marketing’s most overlooked yet most essential concepts: brand associations.

 In his groundbreaking new book, “The Science of Brand Associations: Win Minds, Win Markets”, Appelbaum draws on cutting-edge neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and decades of evidence-based marketing research to reveal the hidden operating system that drives brand growth — and why mastering it is no longer optional in today’s crowded marketplace.

 “Ulli connects the dots between marketing science and real-world branding like no one else. This is the OS behind how brands actually grow.” — Jacob Cass, Co-host, JUST Branding Podcast

 While most branding advice remains opinion-based or driven by fads, Appelbaum’s approach is refreshingly rigorous—and practical. The book distills decades of research into a hands-on playbook for marketers, brand strategists, and agency leaders who want to audit, build, and strengthen their brand association networks.

 “While researching this book, I deliberately avoided opinion-based frameworks or philosophies in favor of those supported by rigorous data and research. The former typically just confuse and don’t provide any clarity or direction,” says Appelbaum.

 The Core Idea: Associations Drive Brand Growth & Success

 Appelbaum argues —and proves — that brand associations aren’t just one component of branding; they are the one concept that silently drives every successful brand.

 In fact, cognitive psychology and neuroscience show us that brands are mental networks of meanings, feelings, and experiences stored in consumers’ minds and memories. They shape perception, trigger recall, drive preference, and ultimately, determine purchase. They allow your brand to grow faster than the competition, acquire more customers, command a higher price premium, and weather recessions better.

 In the book, Appelbaum outlines:

 * 10 data-backed reasons why brand associations drive business results
* 9 proven strategies and 14 evidence-based principles for building stronger brand association networks
* Diagnostic scorecards and practical frameworks to assess and strengthen brand health
* Insights from respected thought leaders including Mark Ritson, Byron Sharp, Jenni Romaniuk, Kevin Lane Keller, etc. and global research firms such as Ipsos and Kantar.

 “Too often today, marketers operate without direction or focus, wasting precious investment. This book delivers the frameworks needed to build powerful, winning brands.” — Paul Chibe, CEO, Pabst Brewing Company

 A Strategic Classic in the Making

 Already being hailed as a modern marketing classic, “The Science of Brand Associations: Win Minds, Win Markets” is quickly becoming the go-to resource for brand builders who are tired of fads and ready to embrace science-backed and evidence-based strategies.

 “Understanding how brand associations are formed and retrieved doesn’t just lead to smarter marketing—it leads to better strategies, better stories, and better results.” — Jami Guthrie, VP of Strategy, Insights & Prioritization, McDonald’s

 A Career Built on Results

 With more than 25 years of global brand strategy experience, Appelbaum has worked with blue-chip clients across four continents, including Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Nestlé, General Mills, Harley-Davidson, and many others.

 Prior to founding his boutique strategy consultancy First The Trousers Then The Shoes Inc. in 2014, he held senior strategy roles at top global agencies such as BBDO Germany, Leo Burnett Chicago, Fallon Worldwide, and SapientNitro. His work has earned seven Effie Awards and an ARF Ogilvy Award for Excellence in Research.

 He is also the author of several popular marketing resources, including “The Brand Positioning Workbook,” “Brand Positioning Method Cards,” and “Aha! The Ultimate Insight Generation Toolkit,” which all continue to inspire and guide thousands of marketers worldwide.

 Appelbaum is a frequent contributor to marketing publications in the U.S. and Europe, a guest lecturer at the University of Minnesota’s Hubbard School of Journalism, and a popular podcast guest and keynote speaker.

 “The science and data don’t lie,” says Appelbaum. “Brands that understand and consistently apply these principles grow faster, build stronger preference, and outperform their competitors. The real question is: do marketing leaders have the discipline to execute consistently?”
