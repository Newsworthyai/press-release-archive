# States With the Most Underprivileged Children in 2025 – WalletHub Study

With August being Child Support Awareness Month and 1 in 7 children in the U.S. living in poverty, the personal-finance website WalletHub today released its report on 2025’s States With the Most Underprivileged Children, as well as expert commentary.

 In order to bring awareness to the condition of underprivileged children throughout the U.S., WalletHub compared the 50 states and the District of Columbia across 25 key measures of neediness. The data set ranges from share of children in households with below-poverty income to child food-insecurity rate to share of maltreated children.
