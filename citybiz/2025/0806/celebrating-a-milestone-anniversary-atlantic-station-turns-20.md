# Celebrating a Milestone Anniversary: Atlantic Station Turns 20

Atlanta’s iconic mixed-use destination kicks-off yearlong festivities of community, culture and commerce, including Roaring 20s fall event and more

 A former steel mill-turned landmark Midtown destination, Atlantic Station proudly marks its 20th anniversary with a year’s worth of celebratory events honoring its evolution as a retail powerhouse, cultural hub and catalyst for urban renaissance. Since opening its doors on Oct. 21, 2005, Atlantic Station has become a vibrant symbol of innovation and reinvention at the heart of Atlanta.

 Atlantic Station’s 20th anniversary celebration will come to life through shareable moments, engaging content and interactive campaigns. From social media highlights and behind-the-scenes stories to creative collaborations and onsite events, each effort will showcase Atlantic Station’s integral role as a cultural connector in the heart of Atlanta. The pioneer project will celebrate its anniversary this fall with a Roaring 20s-themed celebration on Saturday, Oct. 25, from 6 – 9 p.m. Additional activities for the public will be announced in the coming weeks.

 Serving as a testament to Atlanta’s spirit of reinvention, the city within a city continues to evolve as a community-focused development connecting residents, guests and businesses. Once the site of the Atlantic Steel Mill, a cornerstone of the city’s industrial boom for close to a century, the Mill proudly served as a symbol of grit and work ethic as it helped power Atlanta’s thriving economy. After shuttering in 1990 and sitting dormant for over a decade, an ambitious vision in the early 2000s paved the way for one of the country’s first large-scale brownfield redevelopments. Today, Atlantic Station’s LEED-certified buildings, walkability and connectivity serve as a nationally recognized model for sustainable urban design, earning praise from city planners across the globe.

 “Atlantic Station represents a transformative chapter in Atlanta’s modern resurgence, living up to the city’s motto of ‘Resurgens’,” said Vikram Mehra, Senior Managing Director at Hines. “Over the past 20 years, it has grown from a visionary redevelopment into a vibrant, mixed-use district and a center of economic and cultural vitality. Atlantic Station has created thousands of jobs and helped establish Midtown as a thriving hub for retail, residential and business.”

 Since its debut in 2005, Atlantic Station has grown into a 138-acre mixed-use neighborhood that blends business, lifestyle and entertainment. The thoughtfully designed destination features communal green spaces, a dog park, children’s playground, bicycle training area, historic walking path and free shuttle. Of the more than eight million square feet of residential, retail, hotel and office space, more than two million square feet house recognizable brands such as Microsoft, Piedmont Healthcare and Wells Fargo.

 The development’s transformation from steel to skyline has become a key component to the city’s economic engine. “Atlantic Station has attracted billions in investment, created thousands of jobs and helped establish Midtown as a thriving hub for retail, residential and business,” continued Vikram. “At Hines, we’re proud to have played a role in shaping this neighborhood that continues to drive meaningful impact for Atlanta.”

 Atlantic Station’s thriving ecosystem is comprised of more than 6,000 residents, 11 million annual visitors and one of Atlanta’s most active event calendars, hosting approximately 250 annual festivals, dining and cultural experiences. Once viewed primarily as a shopping and entertainment complex, today the urban neighborhood serves as an inclusive gathering place for people from all walks of life.
