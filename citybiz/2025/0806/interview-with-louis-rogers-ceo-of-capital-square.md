 Interview Highlights:

 Louis Rogers, co-founder and co‑CEO of Capital Square, has transformed the firm he launched in 2012 into a nationally recognized platform for tax‑advantaged real estate development, investment and management. With nearly $8 billion in assets under management, Rogers—an Oxford‑trained lawyer and former tax expert—now leads a vertically integrated operation across DSTs, Opportunity Zone developments, build‑for‑rent and REIT offerings.

 Rogers began his career in tax law in 1984, quickly gaining recognition as a Section 1031 expert. As outside counsel and later president at Triple Net Properties, he helped structure over $4 billion in DST, TIC and REIT offerings, long before founding Capital Square in Richmond.

 At Capital Square, Rogers built a three‑pillar strategy—Invest, Build, and Manage. From its roots as a Delaware Statutory Trust sponsor focusing on 1031 tax exchanges, the firm evolved to develop and own Class A and B multifamily properties in Southeastern and Mountain West markets.

 Under Rogers’s stewardship, the firm has launched nine Opportunity Zone funds, with nearly 2,000 multifamily units across Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee in the pipeline. Collectively valued at approximately $800 million, these include mixed-use projects featuring retail and amenity space. OpportunityZones.com+1Capital Square+1

 In Richmond’s Scott’s Addition OZ district, Capital Square has delivered over 1,230 units across five buildings—including its latest project, Chasen, a 352‑unit Class A development funded through OZ Fund VII and scheduled for completion by mid‑2025. The firm has raised around $65 million equity for that fund alone. Capital Square+9Capital Square+9SQXAlts+9

 In Knoxville, Capital Square topped out a 348‑unit Class A apartment project, Livano Knoxville, developed in partnership with LIV Development. This project includes workforce housing, and is expected to generate over 600 construction jobs, and nearly $3 million in construction‑phase tax revenue. Capital Square

 Rogers has also expanded build‑for‑rent strategies—detached homes and townhomes in amenity-rich, gated communities—targeted at households priced out of ownership, particularly in fast-growing Sunbelt suburbs. Capital Square

 In manufactured housing, Rogers is pioneering upscale modular neighborhoods that blend affordability with dignity, complete with landscaped lots and community facilities—mostly in Florida markets. Capital SquareLouis J Rogers website

 Beyond building, Capital Square in 2024 launched its Capital Square Housing Trust (REIT), absorbing its best-performing DST assets through selective UPREIT transactions. Rogers says this structure allows DST investors lasting tax-deferral without forced participation, culminating in eventual tax forgiveness. Capital Square+4Capital Square+4Capital Square+4

 Rogers has remained visible in national public policy forums, co‑hosting the Opportunity Zones & Multifamily Investing Summit in June 2025 and engaging with lawmakers including Senator Tim Scott’s office. The firm’s advocacy helps shape potential extensions and reforms to OZ legislation. OpportunityZones.com+1Capital Square+1

 His annual firm letter highlights Capital Square’s industrial-strength infrastructure: a development pipeline exceeding $2.3 billion, a property management division overseeing 11,000+ apartments across 28 cities, and consistent industry recognition—from the Virginia 500 to Inc. 5000’s fastest-growing companies.

 Rogers is also a published author—his book How to Swap Till You Drop demystifies complex real estate tax strategies via accessible stories and clear explanations. All royalties support Richmond’s Children’s Hospital. Capital Square+1AltsWire+1

 Under Rogers’s leadership, Capital Square now delivers on multiple fronts—delivering mixed-use OZ developments, build-for-rent housing, transformation through policy advocacy and sustainable wealth-building for investors. As he notes: “Our investor‑first approach, combined with vertical integration, sets us apart in delivering financial returns and community impact.”
