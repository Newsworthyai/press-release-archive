# Bowdega and Burn1 Bring a New Cannabis Experience to Utica With Grand Opening Friday, August 8

A new cannabis experience is coming to Macomb County. Bowdega, a culturally inspired cannabis retail shop, and Burn1, its adjacent consumption lounge, will celebrate their official grand opening on Friday, August 8 at 45411 Park Ave, Utica, with a full day of festivities. Guests can enjoy food trucks, live DJs, exclusive giveaways, and more.

 The grand opening introduces one of the region’s first cannabis destinations to combine high-quality retail with a legal onsite consumption space. With only a limited number of licensed cannabis lounges operating in Michigan, Burn1 offers something most cannabis users in the state still don’t have: a legal place to come together, unwind, and enjoy cannabis with community.

 Company founder Marvin Kiezi said the concept brings a familiar, community-first spirit to the cannabis industry.

 “Bowdega is more than a dispensary. It’s a reflection of the block,” said Kiezi. “We’ve built a space that feels like your favorite corner store: familiar, fast, flavorful, and community-driven. From the product curation to the vibe, everything is designed to serve the people and support the culture.”

 Burn1, located directly next door to the retail store, is a fully licensed, 3,000 sq. ft. cannabis consumption lounge where customers can enjoy what they purchase in a safe, welcoming setting. With five hotels nearby, Burn1 is also a practical option for visitors who cannot smoke in their accommodations, and for locals looking for a compliant, social place to consume.

 Whether solo or in groups, Burn1 offers a space for the communal side of cannabis to thrive. Every detail, from curated music, cozy seating and an open-air patio to live art and community events, is crafted to bring people together and celebrate Utica’s unique vibe. At Burn1, it’s not just about smoking–it’s about creating moments, sharing stories, and feeling right at home. The space is also available for private rental.

 

 The consumption lounge has also been approved for Farmer’s Fridge, slated to be installed mid-month. The vending-style machines often found in airports, hospitals and large workspaces offer lounge patrons healthy food if they choose. Consumption lounges are not permitted to handle food.

 Together, Bowdega and Burn1 create a full-circle cannabis experience for both new and experienced consumers. The 5,500-square-foot retail store features top-tier Michigan-grown brands such as Big League Brands, Peninsula Gardens, LocalGrove, Fear of Boof, Platinum Vape, Jeeter, Mitten Extracts, Rosin, Hytek, Hyman, Fresh Canna, Flower Power, Stiiizy, and 75 Labs products.

 “Our goal is to be a trusted retailer with quality products,” said Kiezi.

 Customers will find a full range of products, including:

 * Flower
* Pre-rolls
* Edibles
* Concentrates
* Vaporizers
* CBD products
* Topicals
* Tinctures
* Accessories
* Branded apparel

 The grand opening celebration on Friday, August 8 will feature music, giveaways, and food trucks throughout the day. Visitors must be 21 or older with a valid ID to enter either location.
