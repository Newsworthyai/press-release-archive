# AutoNation Helps Young Drivers Gear Up for a Safe School Year With Free Car Care Clinics in Dallas-Fort Worth

New survey finds young drivers ignore vehicle warning indicators, delay vehicle care

 AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) is helping local families start the school year off on the right track by hosting free AutoNation Car Care Clinics at select AutoNation stores throughout August and September in North Texas. Backed by a new survey showing that 92% of parents believe routine maintenance is key to safety, the clinics are designed to give young drivers the knowledge and confidence to care for their vehicles. The survey was conducted online by Atomik Research on behalf of AutoNation among more than 1,000 U.S. parents of driving-age children.

 The survey found that 42% of parents of 15- to 22-year-olds said dashboard warning indicators were ignored for a week or more, including 10% who said vehicle warnings were ignored for three or more months.

 AutoNation wants to keep young drivers safe and vehicles road-ready. The company’s Car Care Clinics underscore the importance of regular maintenance, with simple, hands-on tips to promote safety and prevent costly repairs.

 Other survey findings included:

 * 14% of parents report it’s been more than six months since their young driver’s vehicle had a full safety inspection, while 22% report being unaware of the last time the vehicle underwent a comprehensive safety inspection.
* Nearly half of parents surveyed expressed concerns regarding the condition of the vehicle’s critical components, such as brakes and tires.

 With tips on everything from checking tire pressure to understanding dashboard warning lights, AutoNation’s expert technicians will share essential car care tips such as jumpstarting a battery, proper tire inflation, changing a flat tire, checking vehicle fluids, and safety items to store in a car in case of an emergency.

 AutoNation Associates are driven by a shared commitment to providing an exceptional Customer experience at every point in a vehicle owner’s journey. These car care and driver safety clinics are intended to be the beginning of a safe journey for young drivers here in North Texas.

 In addition to car care tips, clinics will incorporate driver safety education led by local community partners on topics from distracted and impaired driving to proper driving positioning, seatbelt usage and what to do when pulled over for a traffic violation or when faced with a field sobriety test. Young adult drivers and parents who participate will have opportunities to ask questions and will receive a mini car care kit with essential items to support their safety and car care journey.
