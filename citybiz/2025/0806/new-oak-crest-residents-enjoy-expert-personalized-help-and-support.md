# New Oak Crest Residents Enjoy Expert, Personalized Help and Support

By Danielle Rexrode

 One of the greatest benefits of joining the Priority List at Oak Crest, an Erickson Senior Living community in Parkville, Md., is exclusive access to Planning and Moving Consultant Ashley Ruth.

 From guidance on space planning and selecting a real estate agent to downsizing and packing, Ruth provides personalized assistance on all aspects of the process to help incoming residents simplify their moves.

 Judy Hurdle, who moved to Oak Crest in July 2024 from nearby Nottingham, Md., had worried that listing the house she’d lived in for 40 years might be a challenge.

 However, “Everything went unbelievably smoothly!” she recalls. “Ashley provided a list of recommended real estate agents and helped me stay on track with downsizing. She even offered suggestions on where I could donate my unwanted items.”

 As a Priority List member, Judy enjoyed a range of valuable perks, but this personalized planning and moving support was the most impactful one by far.

 First steps “I often tell Priority List members that the best first step is to schedule a no-pressure, complimentary home visit to discuss goals and an ideal timeline,” explains Ruth. “With just one home visit, we can create a tailored plan based on your timeline and determine vendors that will offer the support you need.”

 For Judy, her in-home visit set the tone for a wonderful partnership.

 “When Ashley visited my house, she was extremely helpful in helping me determine a layout for my furniture in the floor plan I chose at Oak Crest,” says Judy. “The referral she offered for a moving company was invaluable, making the move seamless.”

 She adds, “By the end of moving day, every fork and glass was in its proper place! I couldn’t have managed this move without Ashley’s help and reassurance.”

 A seamless move Al and Tricia Horst also took advantage of the range of complimentary coordination of planning and moving services available to Priority List members, including attending a seminar on how to downsize.

 Thanks to their preparation and support from Ruth and Oak Crest’s preferred vendors, their move from Bel Air, Md., in the fall of 2024 was seamless.

 “Oak Crest guided us through the entire moving process, focusing on what worked best for us,” says Tricia.

 “Ashley really helped when it came to identifying the services we needed, whether it was finding movers, house cleaners, or an estate sale. She even provided multiple options for each service, allowing us to choose the best fit,” explains Al.

 “We ultimately used one of the real estate agents recommended by Oak Crest, and we sold our house for asking price in a timely manner. It worked out quite well!”

 Plus, using a preferred real estate agent to list their house made the Horsts eligible for Oak Crest’s Move On Us® program, which offers a reimbursement of up to $2,000 in approved moving expenses.

 ‘Happy to be here’

 Now, the Horsts have settled into their two-bedroom residence and truly feel at home.

 “We have found the community to be very friendly. We also know some members of our church back in Bel Air who live here,” says Tricia.

 “I’ve reconnected with several colleagues I worked with in Aberdeen who now live here, and we’ve established a STEM academy,” adds Al. “We meet once a month to give lectures.”

 The active couple enjoys visiting the on-site fitness center as well. Tricia participates in a faith group, while Al plans to take advantage of the woodshop and poker groups.

 “I’m surprised at how quickly we adjusted to living here,” says Tricia.

 “We loved where we lived in Bel Air–we were there for 18 years. I thought it would be difficult to leave, but we are happy to be here and settled in.”
