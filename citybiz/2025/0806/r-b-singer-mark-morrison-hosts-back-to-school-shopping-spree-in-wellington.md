# R&amp;B Singer Mark Morrison Hosts Back-To-School Shopping Spree in Wellington

A Back-To-School Shopping Spree At The Mall At Wellington Green

 British R&B star and Palm Beach Gardens resident Mark Morrison, known globally for his multi-platinum anthem “Return of the Mack,” recently staged a meaningful return — this time, in the spirit of generosity and giving back.

 On Monday, August 4, Morrison hosted a back-to-school shopping spree at The Mall at Wellington Green for more than 30 children from Big Brothers Big Sisters of Palm Beach and Martin Counties and Coastal Middle and High School. The mall opened early so kids could shop for school shoes, socks, and select clothing at Foot Locker and Foot Locker Kids.

 One especially touching moment came when young, 8-year-old Apollo Acevedo began crying after realizing he wasn’t on the list to receive shoes. “I wanted to get shoes, but I wasn’t on the list, so I started to get sad,” he shared.

 Upon hearing this, Mark Morrison immediately stepped in and bought Apollo a new pair of sneakers on the spot.

 “Thank you so much, Mr. Morrison, I really appreciate this!” Apollo beamed.

 “When I was young, I could never afford name-brand trainers, and I never forgot how that felt. No child should have to walk into school feeling like they don’t belong. If I can change that for even one kid, it’s worth it,” said Mark Morrison.

 Morrison’s legacy goes beyond music. While “Return of the Mack” hit No. 1 in the UK and No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, selling over 8 million copies worldwide, his current focus includes mentorship and community impact. His catalog has now surpassed 1 billion Spotify streams and 1 billion views on TikTok.

 Community Leaders Respond

 Yvette Acevedo Flores, Executive Director of Big Brothers Big Sisters of Palm Beach and Martin Counties, expressed deep appreciation: “Families are trying to stretch every dollar for back-to-school shopping, so when Mark Morrison offered each of our kids a new pair of shoes, we were so happy. Everyone had a great time shopping at Foot Locker and we’re so appreciative to Mark for giving our kids this wonderful opportunity.”

 Julie Schalm, Marketing Director at The Mall at Wellington Green, added: “The mall opened early so the kids could enjoy a special shopping experience before we opened to the public at 10 a.m. Creating joyful, confidence-building moments like this is exactly the kind of impact we’re proud to support.”

 Lisa Collum, owner of Coastal Middle & High School in Lake Park, also shared her gratitude: “Back to school isn’t easy for every kid, so to be able to provide shoes for students is so exciting for them. Something as normal as shoes can really change a student’s life as they enter the school year. This has been an amazing opportunity and we’re grateful.”
