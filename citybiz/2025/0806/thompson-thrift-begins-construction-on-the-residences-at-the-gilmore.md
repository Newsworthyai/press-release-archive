# Thompson Thrift Begins Construction on The Residences at The Gilmore

Thompson Thrift, a full-service real estate company engaged in multifamily, mixed-use, industrial and commercial projects across the country, has begun construction on The Residences at The Gilmore, the multifamily portion of The Gilmore, a 35-acre mixed-use development in the Phoenix suburb of Gilbert. The company expects to welcome the first residents in early 2027.

 Strategically positioned in the heart of the Southeast Valley, just off Loop 202 at the northwest corner of Val Vista Drive and Germann Road, The Residences at The Gilmore will be a contemporary, upscale residential community consisting of 300 apartment homes in two, four-story buildings with studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom floorplans.

 “The Residences at The Gilmore will be a lifestyle destination that reflects the energy and character of Gilbert,” said Josh Purvis, managing partner for Thompson Thrift Residential. “Every element, from the upscale amenities to the integrated walkable retail, has been thoughtfully designed to foster connection, convenience and community.”

 Each apartment home will feature Thompson Thrift’s upgraded finish package, including premium stainless-steel appliances, kitchen hardware, elegant quartz countertops, a balcony or patio, deluxe closet shelving, full-size washer and dryer, Alexa-compatible smart hub, and more.

 Thompson Thrift designed The Gilmore to be a vibrant destination that fosters a true sense of place. A Main Street-style entrance will welcome visitors and provide seamless integration of the grocery, restaurant and retail space. Thoughtfully designed covered walkways, inviting common areas, murals by local artists and lushly landscaped outdoor gathering spaces have been crafted to inspire connection and community.

 The Residences at The Gilmore will also provide a full suite of upscale amenities including a resort-style heated swimming pool, 24-hour fitness center, a skydeck, event suite with full kitchen, resident social hub, outdoor entertainment kitchens and grilling areas, a dog run with agility equipment, pet spa with grooming station, focus suites, conference rooms, and detached garages.

 Residents will also enjoy an easy commute around the greater Phoenix MSA and the multitude of employers in the area, including Intel, Dignity Health, NXP USA and Liberty Mutual.

 Brian Timberman, president of Thompson Thrift Construction, stated, “The Residences at The Gilmore’s central location, combined with our commitment to quality and innovation, will provide residents with an exceptional and enduring living experience.”

 When completed, The Gilmore will provide approximately 200,000 square feet of grocery, restaurant and retail space, 300 luxury apartment homes and a hotel. More than 25 leases have been signed so far, including a 64,000-square-foot Safeway, as well as Better Buzz Coffee, Handel’s Ice Cream, Jersey Mike’s, Sweathouz, Rebel Wine Lounge, Square 1 Food Hall, Nook Kitchen, Phantom Fox Brewery, Level 1 Arcade, Woof Gang Bakery and Over Easy.

 Since its founding nearly 40 years ago, Thompson Thrift has invested more than $6 billion into local communities and has become known as a trusted partner committed to developing high-quality, attractive multifamily communities and commercial projects across the Midwest, Southeast and Southwest.
