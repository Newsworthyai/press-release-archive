# A Smooth Move to Charlestown

By Danielle Rexrode   Pat and Walton Miller’s former house in Arbutus, Md., was so close to their new residence at Charlestown, an Erickson Senior Living community in Catonsville, Md., that they could have easily packed up their belongings and walked over.

 But thanks to Erickson Realty and Moving Services, a program designed to help Priority List members streamline their moves, they didn’t have to!

 The couple worked closely with Meagan Deal, Charlestown’s planning and moving consultant, who guided them through every step of the moving process.

 “The whole experience was so personalized,” says Pat. “It really put my mind at ease.”

 First steps

 Deal emphasizes that it’s never too early to start planning for a future move.

 “I often tell Priority List members that the best first step is to schedule a no-pressure, complimentary home visit to discuss goals and an ideal timeline,” she explains.

 She also uses home visits as an opportunity to measure furniture and create a space plan, so Priority List members can start to envision their new living area with their favorite pieces.

 For Pat and Walton, their in-home visit set the tone for a wonderful partnership.

 “When Meagan came to our house, we hit it off right away,” recalls Pat. “She mentioned that she didn’t live far from us, and that made us feel very comfortable because we knew she was already familiar with our neighborhood.”

 She continues, “She did a walk-through of our house, helping us plan out what furniture we wanted to take with us and where it would go in our new residence.”

 Trusted partners

 Based on each Priority List member’s goals and timeline, Deal can also recommend several preferred vendors to help with downsizing, selling their house, and transporting furniture and belongings.

 “We have partnerships with local and long-distance resources to accommodate for both in-state and out-of-state moves,” says Deal. “Most of our preferred vendors have worked with Charlestown for over 10 years, and every vendor has been vetted–we ensure they have a strong track record of quality service, professionalism, and compassion.”

 She continues, “I can identify experienced real estate agents who can list and sell homes for top dollar and recommend trusted movers–specializing in senior transitions–to take care of the entire process, including packing, unpacking, and clean up.”

 That is exactly what she did for the Millers.

 “Meagan gave us a list of reputable real estate agents and movers. I felt more comfortable working with people who already had knowledge of Charlestown and were familiar with the community,” recalls Pat. “Meagan was very knowledgeable, and I was confident in the recommendations she made.”

 The Millers ended up selling their house to a relative, so they didn’t need to hire a real estate agent; however, they did select a mover from Deal’s trusted list of professionals.

 “The movers were so wonderful to work with,” says Pat. “The day we moved, they took care of everything, and they were so careful.”

 Worry-free living

 This October, the Millers will celebrate their first anniversary at Charlestown. Since settling into their new residence, they have taken advantage of Charlestown’s many amenities and enjoyed the perks of a worry-free lifestyle.

 “We know we made the right decision. We really love it here!” says Pat. “There are a big variety of things to choose from; you can pick and choose what you want to do.”

 Pat attends community concerts and classes and volunteers at the Treasure Sale, an on-campus thrift shop run by residents. She has also joined the Little Theater and loves being a cheerleader with Charlestown Cheers, an enthusiastic group of residents who cheer for their neighbors at events on and off campus.

 “I really love cheerleading. It’s so much fun,” says Pat. “The more involved I become, the more I love it here.”

 Don’t wait!

 Deal encourages anyone considering Charlestown’s vibrant, worry-free lifestyle to join the Priority List and start preparing for a future move.

 “With everything coordinated for you, your move will be quicker, more efficient, and less overwhelming,” she notes. “As a result, you’ll be able to enjoy the freedom you’ve been looking for from day one!”
