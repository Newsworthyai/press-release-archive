# From Baltimore to the McDonald’s Bun: A Greek-American Bakery Story

The McDonald’s bun is a remarkable Greek-American bakery success story, rooted in the hard work, vision, and unwavering dedication of two men: Harry Tsakalos and John Paterakis. Their combined efforts transformed a humble Baltimore bakery into a baking empire, a testament to the American dream fueled by European tradition.

 The story begins in the gritty streets of Baltimore in 1943, when H&S Bakery first opened its doors. The “H” stood for Harry Tsakalos, a Greek immigrant born in Pennsylvania and raised in West Virginia, whose early career as a truck driver for Athens Bakery led him to a fateful meeting.

 There, he encountered Isidore “Steve” Paterakis, another Greek immigrant and the bakery’s owner. Their shared heritage and entrepreneurial spirit quickly blossomed into a partnership. This bond was further cemented when Harry married Steve’s daughter, Liberty, intertwining the two families and laying the foundation for what would become a baking powerhouse.
