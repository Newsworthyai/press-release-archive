# Priority Capital Advisory Arranges $26.6 Million Refinance for 467,609-SF Class A Office Tower in Houston’s Energy Corridor

Priority Capital Advisory has arranged a $26.6 million bridge refinance for 2 Westlake, a 467,609-square-foot (sf) Class A office tower located at 580 Westlake Park Boulevard in the heart of Houston’s Energy Corridor. The financing was secured on behalf of the ownership, Younan Company, a global private equity firm.

 Set on 5.4 acres within the 2.8 million-square-foot Westlake Park office complex, 2 Westlake rises 17 stories and represents one of West Houston’s premier suburban office assets. Younan Company acquired the property in December 2022 for $21.55 million when it was entirely vacant. Since acquisition, Younan has completed significant renovations, including a comprehensive lobby remodel. The asset is currently 56% leased with active interest and strong leasing momentum.

 “Refinancing an office asset in today’s environment is no small feat, and this transaction was no exception,” said Zachary Streit, Founder and President of Priority Capital Advisory. “We engaged over 100 capital providers and ultimately secured a lender that believed in the asset’s story, the sponsor’s business plan, and the continued strength of the Energy Corridor. This financing allowed the borrower to retire maturing debt, fund tenant improvements, and secure the runway needed to stabilize a newly renovated, high-quality asset.”

 Strategically positioned along Interstate 10, 2 Westlake offers 22,500-sf floorplates and a robust amenity package including a full-service deli, coffee bar, conference center, tenant lounge, and fitness facility.

 Houston’s Energy Corridor has long served as a central hub for major energy companies. Over the past 12 to 18 months, the district has experienced renewed growth, driven by its institutional-quality office stock, proximity to affluent neighborhoods such as Memorial and Cinco Ranch, and an expanding base of high-end retail, mixed-use development, and recreational amenities. With increasing leasing activity and continued infrastructure investment, the Energy Corridor remains one of Houston’s most dynamic and desirable office submarkets.

 Since its inception just over a year ago, Priority Capital Advisory has closed more than $500 million in debt financing across 21 transactions. The firm continues to earn a reputation for moving quickly, working tirelessly, and delivering liquidity solutions for sophisticated sponsors in challenging capital markets.
