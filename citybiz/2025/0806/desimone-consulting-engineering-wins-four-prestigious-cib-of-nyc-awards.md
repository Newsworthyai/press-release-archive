# DeSimone Consulting Engineering Wins Four Prestigious CIB of NYC Awards

Concrete Industry Board of New York recognizes firm’s work with annual Robert H. Corbetta recognition

 DeSimone Consulting Engineering announced that it has been recognized with four prestigious 2025 Richard H. Corbetta Awards by the Concrete Industry Board of New York City (CIB NYC)—including the Grand Award for the structural design of 55 Willoughby, a 46-story residential tower that cantilevers over an adjacent building in Brooklyn, New York.

 The awards, which celebrate engineering excellence and superior concrete construction, will be presented at the Annual Roger H. Corbetta Awards Dinner on Thursday, October 30, 2025, at the iconic Rainbow Room in Manhattan.

 The CIB of NY also conferred honors on DeSimone for their excellence in structural engineering for three additional NYC projects, including in the Mid-Rise Award for 420 Carroll Street in Brooklyn, the Adaptive Reuse Award for Terminal Warehouse in Manhattan, and the Sustainability Award for Sendero Verde in East Harlem.

 “We’re honored to receive these prestigious awards from the Concrete Industry Board of NYC. Every day our engineers strive to meet the highest standards of innovation and technical excellence in service to our clients,” said Stephen V. DeSimone, Chairman and CEO of DeSimone Consulting Engineering. “These awards acknowledge the novel solutions devised by our teams to address each project’s unique challenges.”

 For the soaring, 468-foot-tall 55 Willoughby tower, the DeSimone team tapped into their creativity to design a reinforced concrete structure that could elegantly hover over and occupy the airspace above an adjacent building on a dense, downtown Brooklyn site. Their innovative solution, focused on the addition of a cantilever off the main structure to support and balance 31 stories above the existing structure, employed four concrete transfer beams—a single-story-deep—eliminating the need for complicated trusses. This unconventional approach showcases DeSimone’s ability to harness concrete’s structural adaptability and precision and optimize staged post-tensioning phasing techniques to minimize deflection and align the tower’s curtain walls.

 DeSimone designed the concrete structural system for 420 Carroll Street, a mixed-use, dual-tower residential development along Brooklyn’s Gowanus Canal. Featuring cast-in-place flat slabs, deep foundations, and transfer beams, the structure was designed to meet flood zone regulations while supporting architectural flexibility and community amenities. An innovative use of concrete provided a resilient solution to the challenges of a waterfront development located in a flood-zone potentially subject to extreme climate events.

 The historic Terminal Warehouse redevelopment transformed four, 19th-century conjoined warehouse structures into a modern workplace and retail destination while preserving a sense of its past. DeSimone engineered new concrete supports through the existing structure to enable the addition of a six-story, 200,000 SF overbuild above the existing structures, while a complex shoring system supported and safeguarded the landmarked brick façades during construction. The DeSimone team harnessed concrete’s strength and adaptability to unite the old with the new, evolving the structure without compromising its integrity or heritage.

 Sendero Verde is the largest Passive House affordable housing development in the world. DeSimone provided structural engineering for the three-building, 780,000 SF complex that includes 695 affordable housing units, a 50,000 SF school, and a 12,000 SF community center. Long-span steel beams played a vital role in shaping in the elevated 70-foot-span Sendero Plaza, an open green space above a full-scale gymnasium. Concrete mixes were carefully specified to reduce embodied carbon, supporting Passive House standards and improving long-term durability.
