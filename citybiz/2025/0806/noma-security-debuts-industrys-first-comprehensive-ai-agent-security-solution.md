# Noma Security Debuts Industry’s First Comprehensive AI Agent Security Solution

Noma Security, the leading AI security company, today announced the launch of its AI Agent Security solution, making it the first AI security platform capable of securing agentic AI at scale. This release extends Noma’s extensive security platform for enterprise AI, to address the unique risks introduced by agentic AI, providing security teams with the tooling required to discover, monitor, and govern these advanced autonomous agents and to confidently deploy agentic AI across their organizations.

 Enterprise security teams are facing an unprecedented security challenge as AI agents proliferate across the enterprise with increasing autonomy. Unlike traditional cybersecurity threats, agentic AI introduces unique vulnerabilities including rogue agents operating without oversight, excessive data access permissions, and unpredictable runtime behaviors that can compromise entire networks and highly sensitive data.

 The autonomous decision making capabilities of these agents have the potential to expose organizations to attacks that cascade across interconnected systems with extraordinary speed, dramatically amplifying their potential impact and making detection and incident response exponentially more difficult. Noma’s AI Agent Security platform addresses this critical gap with purpose-built protection designed to defend against agentic AI threats while integrating seamlessly into existing security workflows, enabling organizations to harness AI innovation without compromising enterprise safety.

 “AI agents have created a fundamental shift in how enterprises operate, with AI agents now becoming deeply integrated into the workforce and business operations,” said Niv Braun, Co-Founder and CEO of Noma Security. “AI agents are multiplying and are already embedded in enterprise workflows, yet most organizations have no visibility into these systems or a way to secure them. Noma is the first platform purpose built to secure agents at scale, providing unprecedented visibility and control to ensure they can maximize the transformative power of agents, without slowing down innovation.”

 Purpose-Built for Agentic AI

 Noma’s purpose-built AI security and governance platform scales to manage agentic AI security enterprise-wide while maintaining the agility to stay ahead of rapidly evolving AI threats. The solution provides end-to-end coverage for all AI agent categories including no-code agents adopted by business users like ServiceNow, Salesforce AgentForce, and Microsoft Copilot Studio, application agents built by engineering teams like LangChain or CrewAI, and coding agents used by developers and R&D teams such as Github Copilot. Organizations now have comprehensive protection across the entire agentic AI stack with unmatched visibility and control into AI agent risks through automated discovery, secure-by-design integration, real-time threat monitoring, and built-in compliance controls.

 “As AI agents become central to enterprise automation and decision-making, security cannot be an afterthought,” said Kevin Mooney, UiPath CISO. “Organizations need comprehensive visibility and control over their agentic AI deployments to ensure they can innovate confidently while maintaining robust security postures. Noma’s approach to AI agent security addresses a critical gap in the market.”

 Key capabilities include:

 * Comprehensive Agent Discovery & Insights: Automatic discovery of every agent within an organizational environment with deep contextual understanding of their complete profile including toolsets, functionality, data access permissions, MCP server connections and operations.

 * Supply Chain Scanning MCP and Agent Toolsets: Continuously scans the agent supply chain for vulnerabilities associated with AI agent toolset integrations, MCP server connections, agent frameworks, third-party APIs, and model dependencies.

 * Excessive Agency Control & Risk Management: Define and enforce enterprise policies like permissive access, enforce enterprise policies, and prevent unauthorized actions across agent workflows.

 * Agentic Red Teaming: Simulate real world agent attacks to identify vulnerabilities in autonomous AI systems before they can be exploited in production environments.

 * Real-Time Runtime Protection: Applies guardrails to detect and block malicious prompts, rogue outputs, and unsafe behaviors, ensuring agents remain aligned, compliant, and secure.

 * Built in Compliance: Comprehensive audit trails for regulatory compliance and forensic analysis.

 * Seamless Deployment: Integrates natively into existing workflows and development environments with no changes required to agent architecture.
