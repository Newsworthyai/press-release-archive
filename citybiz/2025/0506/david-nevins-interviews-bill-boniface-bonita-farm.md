# David Nevins Interviews Bill Boniface, Bonita Farm

J. William “Bill” Boniface is a legendary figure in Maryland horse racing, best known for breeding, training, and co-owning 1983 Preakness winner Deputed Testamony—the last Maryland-bred to win the race. Over the course of his career, Boniface has trained 20 major winners, including champions of the Haskell, Manhattan, Ohio Derby, and Michigan Derby. A former jockey and military veteran, he built Bonita Farm in Darlington into a full-service Thoroughbred operation that continues to breed, train, and retire racehorses.

 Boniface also played a key role in launching the Maryland Million, a pioneering event that helped showcase and sustain the state’s breeding industry. In 2024, he was honored with the John F. Steadman Lifetime Achievement Award from the Maryland State Athletic Hall of Fame, recognizing his decades of contributions to the sport. He remains hands-on at Bonita Farm, committed to the work and traditions that have shaped Maryland’s racing legacy.
