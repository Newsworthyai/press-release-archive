# Rural King Partners with Grammy-Nominated Anne Wilson for Home-State Benefit Concert in Kentucky

Rural King, America’s largest privately owned farm and home retailer, is partnering with platinum-certified, Grammy-nominated artist and songwriter Anne Wilson to present a special benefit concert in her home state of Kentucky. The one-night-only event will take place Monday, Aug. 11, at Corbin Arena in Corbin, Kentucky, with all proceeds benefiting families and communities impacted by the tornado that struck eastern Kentucky in May.

 The concert will raise funds for The Sheppard Family Foundation’s direct work with families in London and Laurel County, as well as the Foundation for Appalachian Kentucky’s regionwide Appalachian Tornado Relief Fund. In addition to the in-person event, the concert will be livestreamed on Veeps, with tickets available for purchase at veeps.com. All livestream proceeds will also go toward tornado recovery efforts.

 “Kentucky is my home, and both the London and Somerset areas hold such dear memories for me,” Wilson said. “When I found out about the tornadoes that hit in May and the devastation they caused, I knew I wanted to host a night that could bring hope and raise money for those in need. I’m so excited to be playing Corbin Arena for the very first time — the same venue where I saw so many concerts growing up. I’m praying this night of music brings healing, comfort and strength to those in need. I can’t wait to be back in my home state.”

 “Rural King is honored to partner with Anne Wilson for this important cause,” said Amy Shafer, RK Foundation director. “With several stores in Kentucky, these communities are part of our Rural King family, and we appreciate the opportunity to help support them during this recovery period.”

 For more information about the Aug. 11 benefit concert, with in-person tickets starting at $43.55 and livestream access starting at $9.99, visit annewilsonofficial.com or veeps.com.
