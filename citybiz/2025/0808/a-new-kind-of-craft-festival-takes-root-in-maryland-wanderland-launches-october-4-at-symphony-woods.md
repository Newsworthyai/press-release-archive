# A New Kind of Craft Festival Takes Root in Maryland: Wanderland Launches October 4 at Symphony Woods

Featuring artisanal goods, live music, curated cocktails, and more in a one-of-a-kind outdoor experience

 Something special is brewing in Maryland. The Brewers Association of Maryland, in partnership with the Hops & Harvest Festival, proudly announces the debut of Wanderland, a one-of-a-kind craft beverage experience set for Saturday, October 4, 2025, from 11 AM to 4 PM in the picturesque Symphony Woods at Merriweather Park in Columbia, Maryland.

 This isn’t your typical tasting festival—Wanderland is a sensory journey through Maryland’s rich craft beverage landscape—blending flavor, music, nature, and art into an immersive woodland adventure.

 “Wanderland is a celebration of exploration,” said Kelly Dudeck, Executive Director at the Brewers Association of Maryland. “We’ve created an event that invites people to slow down, sip with intention, and connect to Maryland’s makers and culture in a completely new way.”

 Highlights of Wanderland include:

 * Curated tastings from dozens of Maryland craft producers
* Live music from regional and nationally touring artists on the Chrysalis Stage
* Artisan vendors, culinary pairings, and hands-on experiences
* Themed “groves” that immerse guests in the flavors and culture of Maryland’s unique regions
* Family-friendly fun, with kid zones and ticket packages for the whole crew

 Wanderland is open to adults and families, offering a range of ticket options, including early access and elevated experiences. Capacity is limited to preserve the event’s intimate and immersive atmosphere, providing something for the craft connoisseur, the curious explorer, and everyone in between.

 Tickets can be purchased by visiting  www.wanderlandmd.com.
