# Prosper Water Adds Executive Chairman and New Board Members

MIAMI–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Prosper Water, a technology innovator in sustainable water treatment, today announced the appointment of Curtis F. Brockelman, Jr. as Executive Chairman, and Keith Oldewurtel as a member of the Board of Directors. Their leadership brings deep expertise in investment strategy and operational execution, reinforcing the company’s governance as it scales its operations.

 These additions come as Prosper commissions its flagship Gas Infusion Biological Reactor (GIBR) technology project in Cabo de Santo Agostinho, Brazil. The Cabo project is the first in a series of planned wastewater treatment facilities with a total capacity of 18 million gallons per day. It features a performance optimized retrofit of a 2.2 million gallon-per-day plant, and is being developed in partnership with one of Brazil’s largest privately held water treatment companies. The project has already drawn strong interest from major players in the water infrastructure sector, fueling a robust pipeline and establishing Prosper as a rising force in modern water treatment.

 With more than 25 years of experience in institutional investment management, portfolio construction, and alternative strategies, Mr. Brockelman brings a visionary approach and a proven talent for identifying trends, and investing in, and building out successful businesses. Known for his ability to anticipate market shifts and transform them into growth opportunities, Curt has a track record of launching and scaling companies across diverse sectors. His strategic mindset, operational expertise, and commitment to innovation position him perfectly to lead Prosper Water into its next chapter.

 Mr. Oldewurtel is an established executive with over 45 years of experience in the water industry. In addition to his role on the board of Prosper Water, he also advises investors, technology providers, and other firms regarding the US water and wastewater market. Prior to joining the board, Keith served as Chief Operating Officer for Veolia North America’s Water/Wastewater Contract Operation and Maintenance business with over $1 billion in revenues and more than 250 treatment plants. Keith’s deep operational experience, regulatory acumen, and strategic foresight make him an invaluable asset as Prosper Water scales its technology.

 “Pushing the boundaries of water treatment takes more than breakthrough technology, it takes experienced leadership, the insight to move innovation from concept to execution, and the ability to lead through complexity with clarity,” said Max MacKenzie, Founder and CEO of Prosper Water. “Curt and Keith bring exactly that, strategic insight earned over decades, and a grounded perspective as we enter a critical phase of growth.”
