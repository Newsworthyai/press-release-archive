# Kwikset Unveils Caerus Handleset, Merging Modern Design with Innovative Functionality

Kwikset, a trusted leader in residential security and a registered trademark of ASSA ABLOY Americas Residential Inc., an ASSA ABLOY Group Company, has introduced Caerus, a striking new front door handleset that transforms everyday entryways with bold, modern design and intuitive functionality.

 Featuring a distinctive oversized backplate, tapered grip and a sleek thumbpiece-free design, Caerus elevates curb appeal while delivering a seamless, ergonomic experience. At the heart of the design is Kwikset’s patented KwikSlide technology — a first-of-its-kind, slide-to-unlock grip that replaces the traditional thumbpiece. With KwikSlide, the winner of ASSA ABLOY’s 2024 Innovation Challenge across the Americas, simply slide the grip down with an elbow, wrist or whatever’s handy once the deadbolt is unlocked to retract the latch and open the door. Caerus makes entry effortless, especially for busy households, full hands, children and older adults.

 Available in both keyed and dummy functions, Caerus brings versatility to single and double front doors. Finishes include crisp Satin Nickel, rich Matte Black and contemporary Polished Chrome, with Satin Nickel and Matte Black featuring Microban® antimicrobial protection to keep surfaces 99.9% cleaner than unprotected hardware.

 As part of the Kwikset Signature Series, Caerus delivers trusted security and performance. The keyed handleset includes SmartKey Security®, which protects against advanced break-in techniques and allows homeowners to re-key the lock themselves in seconds. Certified Grade AAA by the Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association (BHMA) for security, durability and finish, the keyed handleset also meets the highest standards in residential hardware.

 The oversized backplate offers a premium look while still fitting standard size doors 1-3/4″ thick. Installation is simple with just a screwdriver, and the fully adjustable throughbolt accommodates most preexisting door configurations.

 “Caerus combines showstopping style with a fresh approach to everyday functionality,” said Amanda Archer, group manager of product marketing at Kwikset. “With KwikSlide technology, we’ve reimagined the entry experience for today’s modern homes — no thumbpiece, no strain, just smooth, intuitive operation.”

 Starting at $235, Caerus is available now. For more information, click here.
