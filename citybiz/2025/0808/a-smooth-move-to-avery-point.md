# A Smooth Move to Avery Point

In January, Eugene Eanes moved from his house in Chesterfield County to a one-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath residence at Avery Point, an Erickson Senior Living community in Short Pump, Va.–and it was so easy.

 That’s because he took advantage of the Erickson Realty and Moving Services program, which connects Priority List members with trusted resources–like real estate agents, downsizing and packing experts, and moving companies–to make the moving process as streamlined as possible.

 “I liked having the preferred list of people from Erickson,” says Eugene. “Everything was consolidated, with at least three different options on all the moving services, so I didn’t have to call 20 people. It was great!”

 Plan your layout

 To make the move even easier for incoming Avery Point residents, Jacquelyn Weir, the sales team’s planning and moving consultant, coordinates all the services they wish to use and offers complimentary home visits to get started.

 After a phone call with Eugene to determine his timeline, discuss what services he was interested in, and answer any questions he had, Weir visited his home with a preferred senior move management partner.

 Weir then measured all the furniture he wanted to bring and used a magnetic board to align pieces on his chosen floor plan. Once they mapped everything out, she provided him with digital 2D and 3D renderings of the floor plan they created.

 “It gave me a good idea of how everything I was bringing would fit in my apartment,” says Eugene. “I was able to visualize it.”

 “That’s precisely why we make personalized home visits,” says Weir. “I’ve seen the look on people’s faces when they see it and say, ‘Wow, my furniture fits!'”

 Expert support

 Weir customizes the program to suit the wants and needs of each Priority List member.

 “It’s an incredibly individualized experience,” says Weir. “We make recommendations about our preferred partners based on a future resident’s particular situation. It’s not one size fits all.”

 For example, when Eugune asked for a real estate agent recommendation, Weir suggested partner Catherine Ham of The Pace of Richmond, as she had experience selling real estate in his county.

 Eugene is delighted that she helped him maximize the return on investment in his house.

 “I asked Catherine if I should have anything repainted, and she said I didn’t need to. However, she suggested that I have my house staged,” recalls Eugene. “I did, and it looked like a totally different house. The buyer offered $70,000 over the listing price!”

 Because Eugene used an Erickson Realty and Moving Services preferred real estate agent, he qualified for the Move On Us program, which reimburses residents up to $2,000 in moving expenses.

 “Getting $2,000 back was great,” he says.

 Preferred partners

 Preferred partners can also help future residents downsize and find new homes for unwanted items–whether that be through an auction or consignment or donating to a local charity.

 “Our partners have so much experience with all kinds of items. Whether you have antiques that have been in your family for hundreds of years or brand-new pieces of furniture, every item has value in some capacity,” explains Weir. “We figure out what process makes the most sense for each item.”

 While Eugene wanted to sell and donate some of his items by himself, he did partner with one of the preferred packing companies.

 “I didn’t even know there were people that would come out and pack everything up and then unpack it at my new apartment home. It was great because I doggone sure didn’t want to do all that again by myself,” says Eugene, with a laugh.

 “They did a great job. Using them was definitely worth it!”

 Move on your terms

 Weir emphasizes that when you work with Erickson Realty and Moving Services, you can do as little or as much as you want. If you want to call the preferred partners yourself, you can. If you’d rather have her take care of it, she will.

 “It’s completely up to whatever their comfort level is! We can be as hands on with the process or as hands off,” says Weir. “We’re happy to go through boxes with you, or if you want to handle it, you can. We provide all the support you need to ensure your move is smooth and stress-free.”
