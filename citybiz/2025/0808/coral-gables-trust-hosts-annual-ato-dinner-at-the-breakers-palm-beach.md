# Coral Gables Trust Hosts Annual ATO Dinner At The Breakers Palm Beach

Coral Gables Trust, one of Florida’s fastest-growing independent trust and wealth management firms, proudly hosted its Annual ATO Dinner on Friday, August 1, 2025, at the Flagler Steakhouse at The Breakers Palm Beach.

 Presented in collaboration with the University of Miami’s Office of Estate & Gift Planning, the private dinner was held in conjunction with the Attorney/Trust Officer Liaison Conference (ATO Conference) and has become a cherished tradition for legal and financial professionals across Florida. This year’s event featured captivating live entertainment, sommelier-selected wine pairings, and a thoughtfully curated three-course dinner. Guests also enjoyed a lively raffle of large-format bottles of premium wine.

 “Our annual private dinner during the ATO Conference has become a tradition we look forward to — an evening of meaningful connections, live music, a wine-paired dinner, and a raffle featuring extraordinary bottles,” said Donald A. Kress, CEO of Coral Gables Trust. “Each year, it’s a joy to reconnect with familiar faces and welcome new ones. We are grateful to our co-hosts at the University of Miami and to our valued sponsors who help make this experience possible.”

 John Harris, Managing Director & Chief Wealth Advisor at Coral Gables Trust, added, “The ATO Dinner is more than just a social gathering — it’s an opportunity to strengthen the professional relationships that benefit our clients and our community. Sharing an evening like this, surrounded by colleagues and friends, reinforces the collaborative spirit that is at the heart of the ATO Conference.”

 Silver Sponsors for the 2025 ATO Dinner included Freeman’s | Hindman Auctions & Appraisals, mpi, and Quantum Realty Advisors.

Coral Gables Trust has proudly served as a host and sponsor of the ATO Dinner for several years, reflecting its ongoing support for the legal and fiduciary community and the valued clients they work with.
