ORLANDO, Fla., Aug. 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Sonny’s BBQ, the industry-leading BBQ restaurant rooted in quality food and spreading kindness, has added Matt Zeiger to its team as Chief Financial & Development Officer. In this key leadership role, Matt will oversee finance and development, bringing his strategic vision and deep expertise to support Sonny’s growth plan.

Most recently, Matt served as both CEO and CFO of Quality Restaurant Group, a 340-unit, multi-brand franchise organization operating across 15 states, where he delivered substantial EBITDA growth and led systemwide operational enhancements.

 “I’m honored to be a part of the Sonny’s BBQ team at such a pivotal point in the brand’s franchising journey,” said Matt Zeiger. “Sonny’s has a rich legacy, a strong culture and a passionate team – everything you want in a growth-focused brand. I’m looking forward to helping build on that foundation as we expand into new markets and continue delivering delicious BBQ and an exceptional guest experience.”

 As Sonny’s BBQ continues to position itself for long-term growth, the brand is strengthening its corporate operations team with the addition of key director roles. Alongside Matt Zeiger, Sonny’s has welcomed Debbie Pirone as Director of Training & Operations Support and Eric High as Director of Franchise Relations. The two seasoned professionals bring decades of industry experience to the table.

 Debbie Pirone has over 25 years of food and hospitality experience, including 20 years at Domino’s Pizza where she led operations, training, and franchise development. In her role at Sonny’s BBQ, she will focus on enhancing employee performance and implementing consistent, brand-aligned training programs that support the development of both corporate and franchise teams.

 Eric High also joins Sonny’s with more than two decades of experience supporting franchisees and driving operational excellence.
