# Growing People Big and Small: Celebree School Debuts in Plano

Celebree School, a leader in early childhood education that provides infant and toddler care, preschool, before and aftercare, and summer camp programs, will open its newest school in Plano in early- September. Located at 4033 East Plano Pkwy., the new school will provide a brand new school building with a state-of-the-art playground with a customized program that addresses the physical, social, emotional, and academic needs of children while adhering to Texas’s early education standards.

 Celebree School of Plano at Los Rios is owned and operated by local entrepreneurs and educators Deepti Biyani and Prajakta Desai. Originally from India and longtime friends with strong corporate backgrounds, Biyani and Desai are embarking on a three-school venture with Celebree School, driven by their shared passion for early childhood education.

 Desai, an MBA graduate from Southern Methodist University, is a Senior Business Line Director leading a team to drive more than $350 million in annual revenue. Biyani, who holds a master’s in management information systems from the University of Texas at Arlington, is a Senior Manager of FP&A managing financials exceeding $400 million. As mothers to best friends and 12-year-old daughters, they were inspired to create a high-quality learning environment where children receive the best early education and care. Partnering with Celebree School aligns with their vision of building a strong, community-focused business that nurtures both children and educators while following a proven, values-driven system.

 “We are thrilled to bring Celebree School to our community and create a nurturing, high-quality learning environment where children can thrive,” said Desai. “This venture is more than just a business for us, it’s a commitment to providing families with a trusted, enriching foundation for their children’s growth and development.”

 To kick off the grand opening festivities, Celebree School of Plano at Los Rios is closing out the summer with a free, family-friendly Labor Day Bash on Friday, August 29, 2025, from 5:00 to 8:00 p.m. at the new location. This festive community event features music, local vendors, treats, kid-friendly activities, and more, offering a perfect way for families to celebrate the season and connect before the school year begins. More details regarding the Labor Day Bash can be found on the Celebree School of Plano’s webpage.

 Celebree School lives by its promise to Grow People Big and Small, and was founded on the belief that success in early childhood development is equal parts curriculum and a connection that extends beyond the classroom to address the needs of the whole child and the whole family. Each Celebree School is a village made up of parents, children, and educators while providing curriculum-based care that prepares your child for kindergarten and beyond.

Programs are available for children six weeks to 12 years old with unique curriculums designed to develop positive social skills and values while allowing children to learn about their world through age-appropriate play, projects, and activities. Care is available part time or full time and the school follows an open door policy where parents are allowed to drop in and visit at any time.

 “We’re honored to continue to help brilliant entrepreneurs like Deepti and Prajakta actualize their business goals and have them join our Celebree School family,” said Richard Huffman, Founder and CEO of Celebree School. “As we continue to expand our brand’s footprint through franchising, it’s more important than ever that we partner with local community leaders who have a passion for early childhood education.
