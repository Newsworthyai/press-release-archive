# Craveworthy Brands Invests and Becomes Managing Partner of Gregorys Coffee to Double Down on Hospitality, Quality and Growth

Craveworthy Brands the innovative multi-restaurant platform company, along with its valued partners, Branded Hospitality Kitchen Fund and Harborfield Management Co., LLC has become an investor and managing partner of Gregorys Coffee a New York City specialty coffee company.

 Gregorys is entering a new phase of growth, grounded in its unique approach to coffee, and now fused with Craveworthy’s operational excellence and hospitality-first mission.

 Gregorys Founder Gregory Zamfotis will remain with the Company as President of the Brand and continue to guide it with the passion, quality-first mindset and sense of family that has defined it since day one. With a foundation built on innovation, Gregorys will double down on the systems and stories that set it apart.

 The Future is Craveworthy

 What lies ahead is a powerful opportunity to expand reach, deepen impact and keep raising the bar on what coffee culture can be. With the U.S. specialty coffee market forecast to hit an estimated $81.8 billion by 2030 (Grand View Research) and 66 percent of U.S. adults drinking coffee daily (The Food Institute), the demand for unique, quality-driven brands like Gregorys is increasing rapidly.

 Craveworthy will manage and provide expertise across core business functions such as operations and training, while the Brand retains its ‘not-so-regular’ identity. The Company’s industry-leading team and growth-focused platform are well-positioned to help Gregorys continue fueling the hustle, while maintaining its high-quality standards. With plans to franchise Gregorys in the fourth quarter of 2025, Craveworthy will tap into its full suite of support to further expand with aspiring, qualified entrepreneurs around the country.

 Gregorys’ industry leading coffee program is rooted in its dedication to sourcing and roasting coffee by hand five days a week in New York City. The roastery will continue to serve as the heart of operations and fuel each location with fresh coffee roasted to order.

 A Brand Fueled by Hustle

 Founded in 2006 in Manhattan, Gregorys was created with one vision: to serve quality without compromise to people who hustle hard and expect the best. What began as a single neighborhood café has grown into a culture-defining coffee brand known for its dedication to craft and innovative beverage offerings.

 From scratch-made pastries and a food program curated by its in-house registered dietitian to rotating limited-edition coffees roasted fresh in its NYC roastery, Gregorys places as much emphasis on good food and good people as it does on good coffee. With more than 50 locations across the U.S., the Brand continues to serve communities that aim high, never settle and care deeply about quality and connection.

 Gregorys is on a mission to challenge the status quo by seeing coffee differently. As new product offerings and innovative café formats roll out, the team is ready to serve its growing fan base of loyal ‘Gregulars’ in even more meaningful ways.

Our role is to protect that, while layering in the operational firepower to grow thoughtfully.”

 “We built this family-oriented coffee brand for people who hustle hard and expect quality, without compromise. Our ’Gregulars,’ our baristas, our roasters, our bakers, everyone is part of this story,” added Zamfotis. “As we embark on this new chapter of national growth, we’ll continue putting love and care into every roast, every pastry and every interaction we have in our local communities.”

 “We’re proud of the Gregorys team for their impressive growth over the past few years and thrilled to begin scaling nationally. We couldn’t have found a better partner than Craveworthy to ensure further success,” said Managing Partner of Kitchen Fund, Greg Culkin.

 “I’ve been a proud Gregorys customer since 2009, so this one’s personal. Getting to pour my energy into something that’s been part of my daily life for so long is incredibly fulfilling,” added Craveworthy Chief Business Officer, Josh Halpern. “The beverage category is on fire right now. Consumers are looking for brands that show up with taste, authenticity and convenience, and Gregorys Coffee checks every single box. I should know. I’m proof.”

 Majewski concluded, “There are so many Gregs involved in this partnership, it really feels destined we’d end up partnering with a brand called Gregorys. Beyond that, coffee IS culture, and together, we’re brewing something with staying power. Good coffee, good food, good people. That’s the future.”
