# State Roundup: ICE ‘Holding Cells’ Confine Detainees For Days; Embattled Juvenile Services Names New School Chief

ICE ‘HOLDING CELLS’ INSTEAD CONFINE DETAINEES FOR DAYS: They are politely called “holding rooms,” but in reality, they are cells. These barely furnished cells in a downtown Baltimore building are intended, by ICE’s own guidelines, to hold those arrested on immigration charges for no more than 12 hours, as the detainees are processed and then sent to detention facilities as far-flung as Washington state and Louisiana. But under the Trump administration, ICE has detained immigrants there for an average of 51 hours. One man was confined for more than 191 hours, or about eight days. John-John Williams IV, Sapna Bansil and Daniel Zawodny/The Baltimore Banner.

 JUVENILE SERVICES NAMES NEW SCHOOL SUPER: The Department of Juvenile Services named a new superintendent of schools Wednesday, a week after the release of a scathing audit on the department’s programs and less than two months into the tenure of the new secretary. As superintendent, David Pinder will oversee the education of 2,473 youth in the Juvenile Services Education Program, including those in residential and detention facilities.

 FEDS OFFER $6M TO EXPAND INVASIVE BLUE CATFISH PROCESSING ON TILGHMAN: U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins, with U.S. Rep. Andy Harris and Maryland Department of Agriculture officials, annoucned that her department is making $6 million in grants available to expand capacity for processing the Chesapeake’s wild-caught blue catfish, an invasive species that eats whatever it can, including struggling blue crab and rockfish populations. It’s an attempt to control the invasive population and save crab and rockfish. Adam Willis/The Baltimore Banner.

 MAN TO RECEIVE WRONGFUL IMPRISONMENT FUNDS; HALF COMING FROM WICOMICO: Tavon Tull is set to receive over half a million dollars to make up for almost six years in prison for sexual abuse that he did not commit. Due to budget language approved this year, Tull’s payment is the first that requires the jurisdiction he was wrongfully charged in – Wicomico County– to pitch in for half of those funds. Danielle Brown/Maryland Matters.

 BA CO COUNCILMAN FACES SCRUTINY OVER ALCOHOLISM, CONSTITUENT ACCESSIBILITY: As Baltimore County Councilmember Todd Crandall, a Dundalk Republican, faces revelations about an allegedly drunken encounter with Baltimore County Police last year, some constituents say they have concerns about his accessibility as an elected official. Crandell rarely attends community gatherings and ribbon cuttings anymore, some say, and he’s missed many County Council meetings and work sessions. Rona Kobell and Céilí Doyle/The Baltimore Banner.

 BRAVEBOY SEEKS TO REHIRE WORKER FIRED FOR GROSS NEGLIGENCE: To lead the Prince George’s County Department of the Environment, County Executive Aisha N. Braveboy is turning to someone who was fired from that very department a decade ago. Samuel Belsham Moki was terminated from the agency in February 2014 for “gross negligence,” after county officials determined that he failed to manage the county’s stormwater pollution management program, which led to the county having to pay thousands of dollars in fines. Christine Condon/Maryland Matters.

 IG FINDS IMPROVED CONDITIONS FOR B’MORE SOLID WASTE WORKERS: After issuing a series of scathing reports documenting hazardous conditions faced by Baltimore’s solid waste crews, Baltimore Inspector General Isabel Mercedes Cumming says some of those conditions have been improved. Fern Shen/Baltimore Brew.

 HARRIS SAYS EASTON PASTOR WHO OVERSTAYED VISA CAN BE DEPORTED: The pastor from the Eastern Shore who was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after the agency said he overstayed his visa is subject to deportation because he lacks Temporary Protected Status, said Maryland U.S. Rep. Andy Harris. Daniel Fuentes Espinal, 54, was arrested by ICE in July and taken to a detention facility in Louisiana after overstaying his six-month visa for 24 years, according to ICE. Chevall Pryce/The Baltimore Sun.

 B’MORE OKs $100,000 FOR MACO CONFERENCE: Without discussion on Wednesday, the Baltimore Board of Estimates approved nearly $26,000 in travel requests for 13 more employees to attend next week’s political conference in Ocean City, bringing the total for the four-day trip to 39 people at a cost of $92,000 — an average of more than $2,350 per employee. Brooke Conrad and Carson Swick/The Baltimore Sun.
