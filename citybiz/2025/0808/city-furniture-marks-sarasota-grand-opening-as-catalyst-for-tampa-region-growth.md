SARASOTA, Fla., Aug. 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — CITY Furniture, Florida’s leading home furnishings retailer, celebrated the successful grand opening of its new Sarasota showroom, marking an exciting milestone in the company’s expansion across the Tampa Region.

 The 120,000-square-foot showroom opened with a ribbon-cutting on July 17, followed by a four-day celebration featuring $70,000 in giveaways, live DJs, food trucks, and exclusive in-store experiences. The event drew thousands of guests eager to explore the store’s inspiring spaces, including a Custom Design Gallery, Home Theater Gallery, Florida’s largest mattress gallery, and an in-store Café & Wine Bar.

 “Our vision is to be the #1 home furnishings retailer in the Tampa Region,” said Andrew Koenig, CEO of CITY Furniture. “To achieve that, we need to be where our customers live, offering them convenience, inspiration, and an unforgettable shopping experience. Sarasota and our upcoming Wesley Chapel showroom are key to that vision.”

 Sarasota has already delivered record-breaking customer satisfaction, highlighting CITY’s evolution in customer experience, innovation, and environmental responsibility. Designed to be more than just a store, the showroom serves as a community hub, hosting events and creating spaces for customers to shop, connect, and be inspired.

 Koenig added, “Our expansion into Sarasota and Wesley Chapel represents years of planning to build the right store network supported by our 1.3 million sq. ft. Plant City Distribution Center. Sarasota is exceeding expectations, and we’re excited to bring this same energy to Wesley Chapel when it opens soon.”

 With Sarasota now open, CITY Furniture is turning its sights toward the highly anticipated Wesley Chapel showroom, which will continue the company’s mission to make home furnishings shopping more convenient, innovative, and community-focused throughout the Tampa market.
