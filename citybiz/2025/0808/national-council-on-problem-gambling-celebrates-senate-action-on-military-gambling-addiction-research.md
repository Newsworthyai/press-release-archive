# National Council on Problem Gambling Celebrates Senate Action on Military Gambling Addiction Research

The Senate Appropriations Committee today approved a key provision in the FY26 Senate Defense Appropriations Bill that would, for the first time, make gambling addiction an eligible research topic under the Department of Defense’s Peer-Reviewed Medical Research Program (PRMRP). The decision marks a historic step in addressing gambling disorder as a behavioral health condition impacting active duty servicemembers and Veterans.

 The provision was championed by a broad group of lawmakers, led by Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), and supported by more than two dozen state affiliates of the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG), as well as leading operators from the gambling industry including FanDuel, BetMGM, and MGM Resorts International.

 “The Committee’s action will finally give researchers, local VA clinicians, and military health officials the ability to better understand and address gambling addiction among those who serve,” said Derek Longmeier, President of NCPG’s Board of Directors. “We’re grateful to our allies in Congress, industry partners, and the public health community for making this progress possible.”

 According to recent research from NCPG, nearly 20 million American adults report experiencing at least one problematic gambling behavior “many times” in the past year. Although this research suggests that the risk for gambling problems may be stabilizing, military communities remain disproportionately affected.

 Gambling addiction is one of the most under-researched behavioral health conditions among military populations even though servicemembers are twice as likely as civilians to experience gambling problems. Nearly 40% of veterans who seek treatment for gambling addiction report having attempted suicide.

 “Servicemembers and Veterans facing gambling addiction deserve the same level of support and understanding we’ve worked to build around PTSD, depression, and other behavioral health challenges,” said Sen. Ben Ray Luján. “This provision is a critical step toward recognizing the realities our military community faces and ensuring the federal government invests in the basic, foundational research needed to support recovery.”

 Congress previously mandated annual screenings for gambling disorder in the FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act. However, without federal research funding, military and local VA clinicians lack the data and tools necessary to facilitate early intervention or provide evidence-based care.

 If enacted into law, the FY26 Defense Appropriations bill would establish the first federally recognized pathway for research into gambling addiction in the military. The bill now proceeds to the full Senate for consideration.
