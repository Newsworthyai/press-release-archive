# GoTo Foods Fuels Global Growth: Unveils Moe’s Casa MexicanaTM and Signs Landmark 45-Unit Deal in India

GoTo Foods LLC, the global platform company behind seven of the world’s most iconic foodservice brands, today announced the international debut of Moe’s Casa Mexicana®, a reimagined concept born from Moe’s Southwest Grill®, alongside a major 45-unit master franchise agreement in India with Unify Foodworks. This milestone marks the first international concept purpose-built for the Moe’s Southwest Grill brand, and underscores GoTo Foods’ proven ability to scale brands globally with purpose and precision. With 60% of its development pipeline now focused outside the U.S., GoTo Foods is leading with intention, leveraging its centralized capabilities to unlock long-term global growth.

 Moe’s Casa Mexicana is the global evolution of the beloved Moe’s Southwest Grill brand, created to meet the rising demand for fast casual Mexican cuisine in international markets. Built from the ground up using insights from more than 2,000 consumers across six countries, the concept blends craveable, bold Mexican flavors with locally relevant menu adaptations and flexible real estate formats optimized for growth in emerging global markets.

 The launch comes at a time of heightened global interest in Mexican cuisine, with the category expected to grow by $114 billion by 2026. Moe’s Casa Mexicana is uniquely positioned to capture this momentum with a scalable, insight-led model using existing strong brand equity.

 “Launching Moe’s Casa Mexicana marks a defining moment for GoTo Foods as we expand another iconic brand onto the global stage,” said Jim Holthouser, Chief Executive Officer of GoTo Foods. “Our platform company model has already powered successful international growth for brands like Cinnabon and Auntie Anne’s, and now we’re applying that same proven approach to Moe’s Southwest Grill. With the right balance of global strategy and local market flexibility, we’re delivering consistency, innovation and operational excellence across continents.”

 Moe’s Casa Mexicana: A Purpose-Built Global Concept

 * Strategic Brand Extension: The new name and store design were developed based on direct input from 2,000 global consumers. Research revealed a strong demand for fast casual Mexican cuisine over fusion offerings, guiding the shift to the more Mexican-forward offering, central to Moe’s Casa Mexicana identity.

 * Globally Informed Menu: Anchored in guest favorite menu platforms like tacos, burritos and nachos, the menu also features localized adaptations with proteins and other toppings and scalable spice levels in India, all structured around simplified customization and curated builds.

 * Flexible Store Formats: Tailored for scalability, Moe’s Casa Mexicana offers full-scale, in-line, dine-in and kiosk formats. The smaller footprints and dedicated international supply chain support make the concept ideal for high-density urban areas and developing markets alike.

 * Landmark India Deal: India will be the first market to welcome Moe’s Casa Mexicana, with the first location opening this year under a multi-unit agreement with experienced operators Unify Foodworks. The franchisees signed an agreement to develop 45 locations by 2033, showcasing the brand’s operational and investment appeal.
