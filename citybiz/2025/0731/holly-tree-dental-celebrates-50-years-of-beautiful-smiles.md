# Holly Tree Dental Celebrates 50 Years of Beautiful Smiles

Holly Tree Dental, an established, privately owned family dental practice, is celebrating 50 continuous years of providing dental care to patients on the South Shore of Boston.

 The team of professionals, led by Stephen M. Goldstein, D.M.D. provides outstanding individualized patient care using advanced technology and a personal touch. The team performs comprehensive, compassionate and relationship-based dentistry for families, in some cases serving four generations.

 Holly Tree Dental has been named to Boston Magazine’s Best Dentists list for nine consecutive years based on voting by their peers. As part of their appreciation for 50 years of support from the community the practice has been giving thank you gift cards purchased from other local family businesses to their patients. The team frequently gives back to the community and is scheduled to participate in a team volunteer day at the local food pantry. Holly Tree Dental was recently named a “2025 Best Places to Work” by Cape & Plymouth Business Marketing.

 Goldstein and Jennifer Zysk, D.M.D., participate in hands-on continuing education workshops around the country and implement advanced photography, digital impression scanning, and cutting edge technology for their best patient outcomes and experiences.

 Goldstein, a resident of Norwell, earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from Brandeis University in 2005, and graduated from Tufts University School of Dental Medicine with his D.M.D. in 2009. He is a member of the American Dental Association, the Massachusetts Dental Society, and the South Shore District Dental Society. Goldstein continues to attend post graduate education programs through Spear Education in Scottsdale, AZ and is an Invisalign Provider. Locally, he is an active member of the South Shore Chamber of Commerce and the South Shore Young Professionals.

 “I am grateful to the community for their outstanding support of our practice – through three generations of ownership – and 50 years! Our team deeply values the wonderful relationships that have grown with our patients over the years,” said Goldstein. “A huge part of our success is our dedicated team who provide the individualized health care that our patients deserve. We truly appreciate our patients and their personal stories, and we look forward to continuing to serve the community.”
