# Noma Security Raises $100M Series B Led by Evolution Equity Partners

Noma Security, the unified platform for AI and agent security, today announced it has raised $100 million in Series B funding less than a year after the last round, making Noma Security the fastest-growing company in the AI security category. The round was led by Evolution Equity Partners, with continued participation from Ballistic Ventures and Glilot Capital.

 Noma Security came out of stealth in November of 2024 and ended the year with a strong portfolio of customers in production. Noma Security increased ARR more than 1,300% in the last year with dozens of successful customers across financial services, life sciences, retail, and big tech.

 This investment comes at a critical time for enterprise CISOs as they race to secure and govern agentic AI ahead of enterprise adoption. According to UBS Research, 53% of surveyed organizations plan to adopt agentic AI by 2026, with 83% adopting AI agents by 2028.

 Noma Security helps Fortune 500, AI-forward organizations confidently unlock the value of agentic AI wrapped in robust governance, security and compliance. These organizations identify millions of AI and AI agent risks while simultaneously prioritizing and mitigating novel threats at scale. For example, one Noma Security customer processes hundreds of millions of AI prompts every month while scanning thousands of model artifacts and AI environments including cloud, code repositories and AI agent development platforms.

 Richard Seewald, Evolution Equity Partners Founder and Managing Partner, said, “We are intimately familiar with the AI security category and chose to invest in Noma Security based on two main factors. First, the Noma Security founding team had the foresight to build a comprehensive AI security and governance platform to address all CISO challenges related to AI security. Second, as evidenced by rapid customer growth, Noma Security quickly found product-market fit within the enterprise CISO’s organization with a solution for agentic AI security and governance.”

 Niv Braun, Noma Security CEO and Co-Founder, said, “AI agent adoption is exploding within our customer base and CISOs understand that AI innovation must be thoughtfully deployed with full guardrails. Noma Security is the only cybersecurity vendor to offer an end-to-end platform purpose-built to identify and mitigate the uniquely advanced risks of agentic AI.

 “Alongside our customers and partners we built the most-comprehensive security and governance solution for both AI and agents. We’re thrilled to partner with Evolution Equity Partners as we continue to lead the enterprise AI security category and help our customers deliver AI innovation with confidence.”

 In addition to accelerated innovation in AI and agent security, this funding round will be used to further expand Noma Security go-to-market operations across North America and EMEA and to more rapidly grow its product, R&D and research teams in Tel Aviv.
