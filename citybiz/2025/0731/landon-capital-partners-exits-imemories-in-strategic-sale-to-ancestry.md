# Landon Capital Partners Exits iMemories in Strategic Sale to Ancestry

Landon Capital Partners, a leading lower-middle-market private equity firm, alongside its partner Greens Farms Capital, announced on July 31, 2025, the sale of iMemories to Ancestry.

 Headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, iMemories has digitized more than 100 million memories for over one million families across the U.S. and is the market leader in this space. Ancestry, based in Lehi, UT, is the world leader in family history and consumer genomics. The acquisition brings together two category-defining platforms with a shared mission: to help families preserve special moments across generations.

 Since LCP’s investment in 2022, iMemories has doubled EBITDA, expanded internationally and upgraded its technology, operations and customer reach. LCP added value through its active, strategic advisory role at board level, while iMemories’ best-in-class management team was instrumental in the successful execution of the strategy.

 Sundip Murthy, Managing Partner at LCP, said: “We are pleased with our partnership with the iMemories team and the company’s tremendous value creation. This is another successful exit for LCP in a challenging M&A environment, which speaks to the quality of the business and the strength of the management team. Ancestry is an ideal and complementary buyer for iMemories, and we are excited for the future of the combined businesses.”

 Mark Rukavina, Founder & CEO of iMemories, said: “We’re grateful to Landon Capital Partners and Greens Farms Capital for their support and strategic guidance. As part of Ancestry, we can now weave every photo, film reel, and videotape we restore into the broader story of where a family comes from – bringing historical discoveries to life in vivid color and motion. By combining iMemories’ AI‑enhanced media platform with Ancestry’s unrivaled historical data and DNA insights, we will give millions of families an end‑to‑end heritage experience that both preserves their memories and brings them powerfully to life for generations to come.”

 Michael Kessler, Founder and Managing Partner at Greens Farms Capital, who served as Chairman of iMemories during the investment period, said: “Since Landon Capital Partners’ and Greens Farms Capital’s investment, the exceptional team at iMemories – led by Mark Rukavina and Steve Krell – made strategic investments in infrastructure, international expansion, and AI-focused product innovation to scale the business and elevate the consumer experience. The results have been impressive, with the company exceeding its planned growth objectives while continuing to build momentum for the future. It has been a privilege to work alongside such visionary entrepreneurs during this period of transformational progress.”

 Landon Capital Partners invested in iMemories in partnership with Greens Farms Capital and iMemories’ management, bringing institutional credibility and deep operational experience to an already successful business. From day one, the firm worked closely with iMemories’ leadership team, to provide strategic input while empowering existing management to lead day-to-day execution. Throughout its 3.5-year investment period, LCP maintained an active role as majority board representative on behalf of the firm’s family-office investors, contributing financial and strategic guidance and helping the business exceed its financial goals.

 The buyer, Ancestry, is the global leader in family history and consumer genomics. The company sees the acquisition of iMemories as a natural extension of its existing offerings, allowing its 3.7 million subscribers the opportunity to further enrich their family storytelling experience through preserved visual media.

 Howard Hochhauser, President and CEO of Ancestry, said: “We’re thrilled to welcome iMemories to the Ancestry family. Their technology and customer-first approach align perfectly with our mission to help people discover, preserve and share their family stories. Together, we’ll give millions of families the ability to bring their cherished memories to life in a whole new way.”

 JEGI CLARITY + LEONIS acted as exclusive financial advisor to iMemories in connection with the transaction. Lowenstein Sandler LLP and Goulston & Storrs served as legal advisors to the Company. Each of these firms played a pivotal role in running an efficient and competitive process that culminated in a successful outcome for all parties.
