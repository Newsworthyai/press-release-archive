# State Roundup: Watchdog Flags Failures In Youth Detention System; Delegate Pushes For Stiffer Penalties For Fentanyl Dealers

WATCHDOG FLAGS FAILURES IN YOUTH DETENTION SYSTEM: A state watchdog has flagged failures in Maryland’s youth detention system, including sexual activity among three boys being held at a Western Maryland facility and an attempt by agency leadership at the time to limit investigators’ access to video footage of the incident. Brenda Wintrode/The Baltimore Banner.

 DELEGATE PUSHES TO STIFFEN PENALTIES FOR FENTANYL DEALERS: In the wake of early July’s multiple mass overdoses in Baltimore, a Republican delegate is making another push to pass legislation that would impose stiff penalties on fentanyl dealers. Del. Chris Tomlinson, a representative of Carroll and Frederick counties, said Tuesday that people are putting “a deadly poison on the street,” and, to him, it doesn’t matter if they’re aware of it. Hannah Gaskill/The Baltimore Sun.

 A MAGA MAJORITY TAKES OVER SOMERSET’s SCHOOL BOARD: Shortly after a MAGA-aligned majority took control of Somerset County’s school board in last year’s election, they got to work. They passed a policy on what flags could be flown, attempted to usurp the superintendent’s decision-making power, and assumed control of decisions on which library books are purchased. Then they came for the school librarians. And that was too much. Liz Bowie/The Baltimore Banner.

 STATE BOE UPDATES LITERACY, MATH STANDARDS: The Maryland State Board of Education passed updates Tuesday to literacy and math standards for the first time in 15 years and held its annual election of officers during the first monthly meeting of the 2025-26 term. Brendan Nordstrom/The Baltimore Sun.

 * The Maryland State Board of Education will maintain its current leadership for another year. On Tuesday, the board unanimously reelected Joshua Michael to serve a second year as president and Monica Goldson as vice president. William Ford and Danielle Brown/Maryland Matters.

 MARYLAND JOINS SUIT TO PROTECT SNAP USER INFORMATION: Maryland has joined 20 other states and Washington, D.C., in a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s demand for personal information of those who are part of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP. William Ford/Maryland Matters.

 MARTHA’S VINEYARD IS MECCA FOR BLACK MARYLANDERS, FUND-RAISING POLS: It’s a vacation spot for Black Marylanders. But Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts is also called The Mecca for Black political fund-raising. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks swooped in to Martha’s Vineyard last August and held a fundraiser as she picked up steam in her historic win as Maryland’s first Black female U.S. senator. A 2022 fundraiser for then-gubernatorial candidate Wes Moore was an early sign of the rainmaking ability he has demonstrated. John-John Williams/The Baltimore Banner.

 DESPITE CANCELED GRANTS SOME RESEARCH IN MARYLAND CONTINUES: Some canceled university research grants are in flux as the Trump administration appeals a lower-court decision blocking its grant cancellations to the U.S. Supreme Court. But that’s not stopping some of the research in Maryland from continuing — for now. Brooke Conrad/The Baltimore Sun.

 WAY CLEARED FOR MARYLAND JUDGE TO PAUSE BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP BAN: A federal appeals court on Tuesday paved the way for a Maryland judge to approve an emergency pause on President Donald Trump’s birthright citizenship ban, the third lower court decision this month that potentially sets back implementation of the measure that has already reached the Supreme Court once. Katie Mettler/The Washington Post.

 KLAUSMEIER’s IG PICK, RESIDENCY FACE SCRUTINY: The former federal auditor tapped by Baltimore County Executive Kathy Klausmeier to become the county’s next inspector general faced a slew of questions and comments Tuesday that ran the gamut from scrutinizing her experience to questioning her residency. Natalie Jones/The Baltimore Sun.

 * Khadija E. Walker, the Klausmeier nominee, lives in Fredericksburg, Va., placing her about 110 miles and 2½ hours away by car from her prospective job. Land records show that Walker purchased a $755,000 home on 2.67 acres in the far south Washington, D.C., exurb last September, the same month she took a job as deputy assistant inspector general for audits at the U.S. AID. The county does not require an inspector general to live in the jurisdiction where they work. Mark Reutter/The Baltimore Brew.
* The embattled nominee faced some tough questioning from a skeptical County Council, a majority of whom have said they will only support the current IG, Kelly Madigan. John Lee/WYPR-FM.

 B’MORE REGISTER OF WILLS SPENT MORE THAN $1M ON MEDIA, PROMOS: Baltimore’s Office of the Register of Wills spent, but could not justify, more than $1 million on media and promotions, including almost $200,000 for a television series that never aired, according to a state audit. Justin Fenton/The Baltimore Banner.

 * “Our review did not identify any matters that warranted referral to the Office of the Attorney General – Criminal Division, but did identify matters that we referred to the State Ethics Commission as well as deficiencies with procedures and controls over procurement and human resource activities,” Legislative Auditor Brian S. Tanen wrote. Register of Wills Belinda K. Conaway, in nearly identical written responses, disputed each allegation, calling each finding “unsubstantiated.” Each reply was no more than three sentences long. Bryan Sears/Maryland Matters.

 PG COUNCILMAN HAWKINS HIRES EX-MEMBER FRANKLIN AS CHIEF OF STAFF: Earlier this summer, Prince George’s County Councilmember Calvin Hawkins II hired former Councilmember Mel Franklin as his chief of staff. Franklin’s hiring comes weeks after he was released early from a one-year sentence for a criminal scheme to steal campaign funds to cover personal expenses — and the efforts taken to hide his actions. Sam Gauntt/Maryland Matters.

 NEGOTIATIONS MAY STOP HOPKINS PATIENTS FROM USING UNITEDHEALTHCARE INSURANCE: Tens of thousands of patients at Johns Hopkins Medicine and UnitedHealthcare just received news some may find startling: They may not be able to use their insurance at their next appointment in a Hopkins hospital or doctor’s office. That’s because Baltimore-based Johns Hopkins, one of the preeminent hospital systems in the country, and UHC, one of the largest insurers, are locked in negotiations. Meredith Cohn/The Baltimore Banner.
