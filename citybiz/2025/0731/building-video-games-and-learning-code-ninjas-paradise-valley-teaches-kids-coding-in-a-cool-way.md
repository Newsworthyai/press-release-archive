# Building Video Games and Learning? Code Ninjas Paradise Valley Teaches Kids Coding in a Cool Way

Say the words “video game” and your kids are bound to stop and listen. The local owner of the new Code Ninjas, a learning center that opened on May 20 at 3923 E Thunderbird Rd., knows that video games aren’t only fun, but educational. Code Ninjas serves the local area by teaching children computer coding and problem-solving skills while having fun building video games.

 The Greater Phoenix Code Ninjas location is owned by local father and entrepreneur Sri Racherla. After immigrating to the United States 25 years ago, Racherla earned his MS in Computer Science and built a successful career in software development and financial technologies. Now, as the founder of his own consulting practice, he is excited to expand his business ventures with Code Ninjas in Paradise Valley.

 “My son has been attending Code Ninjas for four years, and the impact has been incredible,” said Racherla. “Beyond learning to code, Ninjas develop critical problem-solving skills, resilience, and forward-thinking mindsets. Code Ninjas fosters creativity and ethical coding practices, and I’m thrilled to bring this opportunity to more families in the community.”

 Paradise Valley children ages 5-14 can look forward to visiting the Code Ninjas center to learn how to code in a fun, safe, and social learning environment where gaming is celebrated, and STEM is cool. Everything about Code Ninjas is built around fun, which keeps kids coming back. The center also delivers the results that parents are looking for, as their children gain coding and problem-solving skills they’ll need for the jobs of the future. At Code Ninjas, kids have fun and parents see results.

 Code Ninjas accomplishes this with a robust, game-based curriculum made up of nine belts, just like martial arts. The curriculum is self-paced, but not self-taught; kids get immediate help and encouragement from Code Senseis and fellow students as they advance from white to black belt. The program keeps kids motivated with little wins along the way, and “Belt-Up” celebrations to honor their graduation to the next level. By the time a child finishes the program, they will publish an app in an app store.

 Code Ninjas offers a variety of opportunities for children to get involved, including a flexible weeknight drop-in program, camps and Parents Night Out events on weekends.
