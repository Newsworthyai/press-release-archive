# Newsweek Names Help at Home “Greatest Workplace for Parents and Families”

CHICAGO, July 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Help at Home, a leading national provider of in-home, personal care services, announced it has been named by Newsweek as one of America’s Greatest Workplaces for Parents and Families 2025. This marks the third consecutive year the company has earned this prestigious recognition, underscoring its continued commitment to fostering and maintaining a strong, supportive workplace culture.

 According to Newsweek, for working parents across America, the ability of a company to respect and support their needs is a vital factor in determining where they choose to grow their career. A significant factor for employees included resources that allow parents to maintain a work-life balance. Ultimately, businesses that strive to incorporate better practices for parents and families have proven to be more desirable places for them to work.

 Help at Home’s 50-year ‘culture of caring’ for its care workforce is central to the company’s mission of delivering caring and compassionate person-centered care.

 “We’re honored to be recognized once again by Newsweek for our outstanding workplace culture,” said Chief People Officer Michelle Bonfilio. “We know how vital work-life balance is for our care teams—that’s why we provide flexible schedules and thoughtfully designed benefits that foster an environment where our people can truly thrive. When our employees feel supported, they are empowered to deliver the highest level of care to our clients.”

 With more than 60,000 caregivers delivering over 85 million hours of high-quality home care annually, Help at Home’s caregiver and employee-first approach drives long-term success. The company outperforms industry averages with respect to caregiver retention and satisfaction, with the average caregiver-client relationship spanning four years, a key contributor to improved health outcomes and client trust. By prioritizing its employees, Help at Home continues to set the bar on industry standards that sustain a culture rooted in compassion.

 “I am a mom, a professional and a current caregiver to my family,” said Help at Home Chief Compliance and Ethics Officer Marisol Castro. “I know firsthand how important compassionate, quality care is — both at home and in the workplace because I wear many hats. The one thing they all have in common is heart and Help at Home gives me the space to lead with mine in every role I serve. Leading with heart fuels compassion and motivates us at home and work to go above and beyond. I’m proud to work for a company that not only understands that — but truly lives it every day.”

 Newsweek’s America’s Greatest Workplaces for Parents and Families list is compiled through independent research based on key criteria including work-life balance, parental leave policies, family support resources and employee satisfaction. This ranking is built on an extensive large-scale survey of more than 200,000 working parents and over 2.6 million company reviews.
