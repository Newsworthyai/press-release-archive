 Tina, what do today’s RIAs need to know about Search Engine Optimization?

 The rules of search have changed completely. Platforms like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Perplexity, and Claude are now the gatekeepers of financial advice. They don’t care about your meta descriptions, keyword density, or backlink strategies. If your RIA’s online presence is built solely around outdated SEO tactics, you’re already invisible where it matters most: AI-driven discovery.

 What’s different about how prospects are searching today?

 High-net-worth clients still start with their smartphones and desktops, but they’re not typing “fiduciary advisor near me” anymore. They’re asking AI for nuanced answers, like:

 Which wealth management firms specialize in multi-generational estate planning?

 Who are the top RIAs for navigating complex tax strategies?

 Who are the best advisors for pre-IPO tech founders?

 If AI doesn’t know your firm or doesn’t see you as credible, you don’t exist.

 What exactly is GEO, and how is it different from SEO?

 GEO stands for Generative Engine Optimization. Unlike SEO, which focuses on ranking on Google’s first page, GEO is about becoming the trusted answer that AI platforms deliver. AI doesn’t serve up 10 blue links; it curates one or two authoritative responses. If your firm isn’t among them, you’re out of the conversation.

 Can you break down the difference between SEO and GEO?

 Absolutely. Think of SEO as trying to get found, while GEO is about being recommended. Here’s how they compare:

 Why do RIAs need a GEO audit now?

 Because the AI landscape moves fast. A GEO audit is like a digital health check for your firm’s reputation. It tells you exactly how AI platforms see you. When we perform these audits, we look at your website content, technical structure, and authority signals. We test AI engines directly to see if they mention your firm or your competitors. If you’re invisible today, you’re missing out on tomorrow’s clients.

 Are there quick steps an RIA can take today? Yes. Here’s where to start:

 1. Audit your AI visibility. Ask ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Claude about your firm. See what comes up.
2. Strengthen your authority signals. Get cited by trusted media, build credible content, and clean up your data structure.
3. Shift from keyword obsession to question mastery. Understand what questions your clients are asking AI, and answer them better than anyone else.

 What’s the risk if RIAs ignore GEO?

 It’s simple: early adopters will own the digital conversation. Latecomers will fight over scraps, endlessly competing on price. AI is shaping perception faster than Google ever did. If you’re not the answer AI trusts, you’re not even in the room.

 How can an RIA get started with GEO?

 The first step is to request a GEO audit. We’ll show you exactly how AI perceives your firm and build a roadmap to make you the go-to expert that platforms like ChatGPT and Gemini recommend.
