# Corsha Lands Cybernetix Ventures Investment to Set the Standard for Machine Identity in Robotics

Corsha, the first and only Machine Identity Provider (mIDP) purpose-built to secure machine-to-machine (M2M) communication across operational systems and critical infrastructure, today announced an investment from Cybernetix Ventures, a leading early-stage VC firm at the forefront of robotics, automation, and physical AI. The funds will accelerate Corsha’s mission to secure every machine connection across robotics and industrial autonomous systems.

 Cybernetix Ventures’ investment highlights the growing need for secure identity and access management in the rapidly evolving world of robotics, connected machines, and physical AI. While cybersecurity has traditionally focused on protecting humans, the protection of machines and operational technology (OT) has been neglected. With industrial systems becoming increasingly autonomous and interconnected, Corsha’s patented machine identity platform (mIDP) ensures that every machine connection is continuously verified and authorized at machine speed and scale. Corsha brings the proven security benefits of dynamic machine identity into manufacturing APIs and protocols, delivering continuous verification as a core pillar of zero-trust for cloud, edge, and complex hybrid environments.

 “Robotics, automation, and physical AI are transforming how the industrial world operates,” said Anusha Iyer, CEO and Founder of Corsha. “This shift demands an identity infrastructure purpose-built for machines. Cybernetix brings both capital and deep connections across this emerging frontier, and we’re excited to partner with them as we scale our platform to secure the next generation of connected, autonomous systems.”

 This investment from Cybernetix Ventures comes as robotics and physical AI reshape industrial operations, driving demand for fine-grained machine identity and access control to ensure these systems operate safely, autonomously, and at scale.

 “Robotics and industrial systems are under constant threat, yet most companies are still treating machine security as an afterthought,” said Mark Martin, General Partner at Cybernetix Ventures. “Corsha has solved the fundamental challenge of machine-to-machine authentication— delivering enterprise-grade identity management that seamlessly integrates into existing infrastructure. Anusha and her team aren’t just building another security tool; they’re establishing the foundational trust layer that every connected system will depend on. This is exactly the kind of infrastructure play that defines decades of industrial innovation.”

 Corsha’s machine identity platform (mIDP) delivers:

 * Strong, cryptographic machine identities for every system
* Dynamic authentication/authorization at every connection
* Automated lifecycle management for millions of machine identities
* Secure deployments in diverse environments from cloud to air-gapped, hybrid, and industrial

 The Cybernetix Ventures investment joins Sinewave, Razor’s Edge Ventures, Ten Eleven Ventures, and Booz Allen Ventures in Corsha’s $18 million Series A-1 round.
