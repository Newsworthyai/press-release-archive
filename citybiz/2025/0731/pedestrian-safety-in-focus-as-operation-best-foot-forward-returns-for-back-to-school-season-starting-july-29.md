# Pedestrian Safety in Focus as Operation Best Foot Forward Returns for Back-to-School Season Starting July 29

To combat drivers yielding to pedestrians in school zones less than 50% of the time across Central Florida, the Best Foot Forward for Pedestrian Safety program will conduct its two-week crosswalk safety awareness campaign, Operation Best Foot Forward, in conjunction with law enforcement agencies across nine Central Florida counties.

 From July 29 to August 8, 2025, plainclothes officers will cross streets at marked crosswalks, allowing drivers adequate time to slow down and stop. Those who fail to comply with Florida law will face a minimum $164 citation and three points on their driver’s license. Many of the crosswalks chosen for enforcement are near schools and school bus stop locations.

 This high-visibility operation will span nine Central Florida counties: Brevard, Flagler, Lake, Orange, Marion, Osceola, Polk, Seminole, & Volusia. The initiative, aligned with FDOT’s Target Zero and local Vision Zero Action Plans, aims to reduce traffic-related serious injuries & fatalities to zero.

 According to a report released in 2023 from the American Academy of Pediatrics, “child pedestrian mortality rates have shown an increase of 11% since 2013, driven by increases among 10- to 14-year-olds and 15- to 19-year-olds. This operation reinforces an important message: Florida law says drivers must stop for people in crosswalks. It’s a simple action that protects lives, especially as children return to school and streets get busier.

 “As kids head back to school, it’s more important than ever for drivers to be alert and follow the law at crosswalks,” said Vince Dyer, Program Manager of Best Foot Forward for Pedestrian Safety. “Operation Best Foot Forward helps remind everyone that stopping for people isn’t optional. With more students walking, biking, and rolling to class, we need to make sure everyone who uses our streets are following the law and being safe and attentive to each other.”

 Operation Best Foot Forward is part of the Best Foot Forward coalition’s larger effort to improve road safety. Studies show that combining enforcement, education, and engineering over a sustained period of time increases driver compliance with pedestrian right-of-way laws, fostering a culture of respect and accountability among drivers. Some of the crosswalks chosen for this operation include:

 About the Best Foot Forward for Pedestrian Safety Program

 The Best Foot Forward for Pedestrian Safety (BFF) program is administered by the local non-profit Bike/Walk Central Florida (BWCF). BFF was created to minimize the conflict between pedestrians and drivers by focusing on one specific behavior change – getting more drivers to stop and yield for pedestrians at marked crosswalks as Florida law requires. More than a campaign, Best Foot Forward is a behavior change-based program designed to improve road safety through consistent and persistent education, high-visibility crosswalk enforcements, and low-cost engineering countermeasures at marked crosswalks. Best Foot Forward operates in nine Central Florida counties and is the largest pedestrian-focused grassroots coalition in the nation, working with more than 100 local and regional partners. Since launching in 2012, the rate of drivers yielding to people in marked crosswalks has increased from 17% to nearly 50%. To learn more, visit iyield4peds.org.
