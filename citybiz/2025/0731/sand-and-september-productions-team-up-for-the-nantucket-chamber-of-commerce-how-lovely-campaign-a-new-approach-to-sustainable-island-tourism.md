# SAND And September Productions Team Up For The Nantucket Chamber of Commerce “How Lovely” Campaign: A New Approach to Sustainable Island Tourism

SAND, working with September Productions, has developed an innovative campaign for the Nantucket Chamber of Commerce aimed at transforming how visitors experience the island. The “How Lovely” campaign promotes sustainable tourism through three key initiatives:

 1. Car-Free Travel: Encouraging visitors to leave vehicles on the mainland and utilize free public transportation, bike paths, walking, and ride-sharing services.
2. Shoulder Season Exploration: Highlighting the benefits of visiting during The Spring and Fall such as lower costs, fewer crowds, and still-“lovely” weather.
3. Affordable (free, actually) Island Experiences: Showcasing Nantucket’s numerous free attractions, including public beaches, walking trails, natural beauty, and public transit.

 The multimedia campaign includes television spots, print advertisements in Yankee Magazine, and comprehensive visitor information guides. Produced in collaboration with Director and Producer, Dan Driscoll of September Productions, the campaign aims to address tourism challenges while presenting Nantucket as an accessible, sustainable destination.

 “The number of people on the island in the summer months is great for business but not great for the island’s peace and well-being. Traffic, parking, housing, infrastructure use, and water quality all suffer. So we’re reimagining how people can enjoy Nantucket,” says Grant Sanders, founder of SAND. “The goal is to demonstrate that a quintessential island experience doesn’t require a car or a massive pile of money, and it can also be had outside the often hectic summer season.”

 The campaign launches this summer online, YouTube and social media, targeting travelers seeking a more mindful approach to island tourism.
