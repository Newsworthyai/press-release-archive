 Helfie AI, a global mobile health platform, today announced the appointment of two new members of the executive leadership team, Stefan Kulik as Chief Operating Officer and Rania Awad as Chief Strategy Officer.

 Helfie AI is building the world’s first human health platform, powered by artificial intelligence, to enable anyone with a smartphone anywhere in the world access to easy, instant and affordable health checks.

 Helfie AI co-founder and CEO George Tomeski said: “The expansion of our leadership team to include Stefan and Rania is a pivotal moment in Helfie’s growth. As we reach across communities worldwide and deliver on our vision of providing an accurate and cost-effective way for patients to obtain health checks, we will rely on their expertise to realize this mission. I look forward to working with them as we continue to develop our Human Health Network platform to bring it to all 8 billion humans worldwide.”

 Kulik has over 15 years of experience serving in executive roles at recognizable companies such as PepsiCo, Johnson & Johnson, and Royal Mail. In each of these leadership roles he developed deep expertise in operational excellence and business development. Kulik also has significant experience in private equity and venture capital environments, with specialized knowledge in predictive analytics and artificial intelligence applications. His unique combination of corporate leadership experience and insights gained from working with elite athletes in performance optimization and behavioural change positions him well to drive Helfie AI’s continued growth and strategic objectives.

 Awad is an accomplished digital strategist and innovator with extensive experience as a licensed pharmacist and business leader. She brings a proven track record of scaling organizations, spearheading digital transformation initiatives, and developing comprehensive product and go-to-market strategies. Her cross-industry expertise spans healthcare, asset management, retail and information technology sectors, with demonstrated success across the Asia-Pacific region, including Australia, New Zealand, and China. Awad’s unique combination of pharmaceutical expertise and strategic business acumen positions her to drive Helfie’s strategic vision and market expansion objectives.

 “Helfie AI is revolutionising the healthcare field by providing consumers with a cost-effective and accurate AI-powered platform, so I look forward to applying my organisational expertise to help achieve this vision on a global scale,” said Kulik. “As we expand Helfie AI’s global growth strategy within the UK, broader international markets, and the US, I will work with my colleagues to bring this critical technology to those who need it most.”

 “Helfie AI’s technology aims to bring equitable health access globally to bypass complicated healthcare systems and put AI-powered mobile health checks into individual hands,” said Awad. “In the near-term, I will use my expertise in strategic marketing to help Helfie AI achieve its next stage of growth, which includes a consumer launch and expanded partnerships with organizations and governments worldwide. I’m confident that the expanded leadership team will deliver on Helfie AI’s mission to become the most trusted AI health company in the market.”

 Helfie AI’s advanced AI technologies analyse pictures, videos, sound recordings or face scans to check for indications of potential health conditions. Helfie AI generates instant results and offers the user information and options on what to do next. Importantly, the user owns and controls all of the data provided as part of the checks.

 About Helfie AI

 Helfie AI was founded in Melbourne, Australia in 2021 and has expanded operations to Europe, North America, Africa and Asia with multiple active B2B partnerships with top tier companies already in place.

 Helfie AI tackles two of healthcare’s most fundamental challenges: the lack of participation in preventative healthcare and the under-utilisation of health data. Every facet of healthcare, starting with the quality and longevity of human life, can be dramatically improved if everyone actively participates in preventative health and if health data is actively utilized throughout the healthcare system.

 The accessibility made possible by Helfie AI can significantly reduce the $7 trillion spent annually on treating preventable conditions.

 Helfie AI provides users with clear next steps, connects them to medical care if/as required, allows interaction around numerous health conditions, from cardiovascular to skin health, and enables sharing AI findings with their own carers and doctors.
