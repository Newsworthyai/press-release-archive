# Ohio Cannabis Retailer The Botanist Opens Solon’s First Dispensary

SOLON, Ohio, July 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — The Botanist, Ohio’s premier cannabis brand, today announced the opening of its sixth in-state dispensary at 33113 Aurora Road, in Solon, OH. As the company’s fourteenth location nationwide and the first dispensary in Solon, this opening extends The Botanist’s Ohio footprint and delivers on the brand’s commitment to curating an upscale and welcoming approach to cannabis in underserved communities.

 The Botanist’s Solon retail store is adjacent to “The District,” a luxury mixed-use development expected to complete construction in the coming year. This strategic positioning will allow The Botanist to serve area residents and visitors while establishing the dispensary as a key amenity in one of Solon’s most anticipated commercial destinations.

 This thoughtfully repurposed space has been completely reimagined for today’s cannabis consumer, from its fresh facade and enhanced curb appeal to its calm, boutique-style in-store experience. Shoppers can explore an array of nationally recognized and locally sourced brands and products, including the full range of The Botanist’s award-winning flower, vapes, edibles, sublinquals, and extracts.

 The new store will feature Northeast Ohio’s first and only drive-through service, as well as options such as pre-ordering and in-store pickup for both medical and adult-use customers. Shoppers can consult with The Botanist’s experienced budtenders to find the right product fit or order online for quick and convenient drive-through pickup.

We’re proud to bring safe, legal cannabis to Solon for the first time and contribute to the reimagination and revitalization of The District,” said Kate Ols, Executive Vice President of Revenue. “Local interest and community feedback have been incredibly positive, and we look forward to establishing The Botanist as a trusted resource for exploring all that cannabis can offer.”
