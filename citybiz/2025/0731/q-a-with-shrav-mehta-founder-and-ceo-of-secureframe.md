# Q&amp;A with Shrav Mehta, Founder and CEO of Secureframe

Founder and CEO Shrav Mehta built Secureframe to eliminate the bottlenecks of traditional security compliance. Today, Secureframe is trusted by thousands of companies to meet modern cybersecurity and privacy standards—faster, smarter, and with far less friction.

 In this interview, Shrav shares how the platform is helping businesses stay ahead of evolving standards like CMMC 2.0, FedRAMP 20x, and AI governance.

 What sparked the idea for Secureframe, and what’s the growth journey been like since?

 The idea came from first-hand frustration. At previous startups, I constantly hit roadblocks trying to navigate clunky, manual compliance processes, especially SOC 2 at the time. I asked my network if they’d use a tool to automate it. Dozens said yes, and one founder called back a month later asking where the product was. I quit my job that week to build Secureframe.

 We got that first customer through SOC 2, and by the time we had an MVP, we had 40+ companies on the waitlist. Today, we serve thousands of businesses. It’s incredibly rewarding to see how our platform unlocks new opportunities for our customers.

 What exactly does Secureframe do?

 Secureframe is a compliance automation platform that transforms what’s traditionally been a manual, resource-heavy process into an automated, real-time system.

 We help businesses achieve and maintain compliance with standards like SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, PCI DSS 4.0.1, NIST frameworks, CMMC 2.0, and FedRAMP, processes that traditionally take hundreds of hours and cost tens of thousands per year. Our platform typically reduces manual effort by 75%, accelerates audit completion by 90%, and improves security visibility by 60%.

 Take Manufacturing Consulting Concepts: they saved 500+ hours getting NIST 800-171 and CMMC compliant with Secureframe. But our goal isn’t just passing audits — it’s embedding strong security practices into company culture and workflows.

 Why is it risky for organizations to delay or overlook their compliance and cybersecurity responsibilities?

 Non-compliance is no longer just a legal or audit risk. It can be fatal to businesses. Especially in industries that require compliance with regulations likeCMMC 2.0 and HIPAA, falling short can mean:

 * Loss of key government or enterprise contracts
* Fines up to 4% of global revenue under GDPR
* Erosion of public trust from security breaches or failures
* Operational disruptions due to investigations
* Lawsuits from customers, partners, or regulators

 CMMC 2.0 is a great example. Contractors who aren’t certified will be ineligible for most DoD contracts when enforcement begins as early as October 2025.

 With the CMMC 2.0 deadline approaching, how is Secureframe helping?

 The DoD recently submitted the final 48 CFR rule for review, with contract clause 204.7503 stating that CMMC enforcement will begin as early as October 1 2025. Once the rule is reviewed by OMB and Congress and goes final, hundreds of thousands of contractors will need to meet Level 1 and 2 requirements to be eligible for contracts.

 Through Secureframe Federal and CMMC.com, we’re helping them assess readiness, fill documentation gaps, and stay continuously audit-ready. We provide automation, policy templates, compliance mapping, expert guidance, and ongoing monitoring, all tailored to NIST 800-171 and CMMC Levels 1, 2, and 3. It’s how contractors stay eligible while reducing time and cost.

 How is AI changing the regulatory landscape and making compliance even more complex?

 With no comprehensive federal AI regulation in place, companies are left navigating a patchwork of state laws and global frameworks, creating confusion, inconsistency, and higher risk exposure.

 The most overlooked vulnerabilities tend to cluster around three areas: data governance, third-party risk, and shadow AI. Without unified guidance, many organizations are making AI-related compliance decisions in isolation, often underestimating risks due to the lack of clear benchmarks.

 We’ve seen companies adopt AI tools for tasks like code generation or customer service without evaluating how these tools handle sensitive data, introduce bias, or expose new attack surfaces. That’s a serious concern considering nearly 40% of code generated by AI tools contained security vulnerabilities, yet many companies aren’t even tracking which AI tools their developers are using.

 How should compliance leaders navigate the AI regulation vacuum?

 The smartest teams are moving away from prescriptive checklists and toward principles-based frameworks anchored in transparency, data protection, and human oversight.

 That means:

 * Extending existing privacy impact assessments (like for GDPR) to cover AI use cases
* Updating vendor risk programs with AI-specific criteria
* Documenting every AI implementation: what it does, what data it uses, and how it’s monitored
* Partnering with legal experts in AI law
* Joining industry working groups to stay ahead of the curve

 One of the most important things we recommend is conducting regular compliance gap analyses, especially as your business grows or adopts new technologies like AI. Don’t just evaluate threats once a year. Build it into your operating rhythm.

 Are there frameworks companies can use today to build AI security readiness?

 Yes, and companies that act now will have a huge head start when regulations crystallize. We recommend:

 * NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) and ISO 42001: Both offer flexible, practical guidance for building responsible AI systems
* EU AI Act: It categorizes systems by risk level, which helps prioritize your governance efforts
* AI-enhanced GRC: Extend your existing governance, risk, and compliance functions with AI-specific capabilities like model oversight and automated audit logging

 Our platform supports these frameworks and more by centralizing oversight and integrating AI-specific risk into broader compliance programs.

 What’s next for Secureframe as regulations continue to evolve?

 We’re laser focused on three key areas:

 * Continuous compliance: Leveraging intelligent automation to reduce manual compliance burdens.
* Federal market leadership: Scaling support for defense contractors, especially around CMMC 2.0, FedRAMP 20x, and NIST frameworks.
* Global compliance: Enabling customers to meet new and evolving standards like the EU AI Act, NIS2 Directive, and cross-border data laws.

 At Secureframe, we believe compliance should accelerate business, not slow it down. Organizations with strong compliance programs can adopt new tech faster, close deals quicker, and build stronger customer trust. That’s the future we’re helping create.
