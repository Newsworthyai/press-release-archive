We look forward to recognizing her profound impact growing the foundation and deepening its mission,” said Barbara Rishel, chair of the Community Foundation. “We invite our donors, friends, neighbors and community leaders to celebrate Beverly’s remarkable journey with the Community Foundation and support her legacy into the future.”

 Tickets cost $75, and sponsorship opportunities are available. Proceeds from the event will support the Beverly White-Seals Legacy of Leadership Fund, an endowed, unrestricted fund at the Community Foundation of Howard County. Tickets can be purchased at CFHoCo.org/Celebrating-Beverly.
