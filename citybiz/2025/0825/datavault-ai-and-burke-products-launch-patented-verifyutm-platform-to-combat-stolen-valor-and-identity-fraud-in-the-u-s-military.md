# Datavault AI and Burke Products Launch Patented VerifyU™ Platform to Combat Stolen Valor and Identity Fraud in the U.S. Military

* Annual Recurring Revenues Will Result from Valor Coin Sole Source Contracting Through Burke Products While Establishing Industry Leadership
* Veterans Day Event to Showcase Solution and Escalate Call for Executive Branch Action to Deploy Blockchain Solution to Restore Integrity of American Military Valor Awards

 Datavault AI Inc. (Nasdaq: DVLT), a pioneer in AI-driven data monetization, today unveiled the global expansion of its VerifyU platform to address surging demand for secure, real-time identity verification amid escalating scrutiny of fraudulent military service claims.

 VerifyU equips military institutions and their exclusive government contracting partner, Burke Products, with a patented AI framework for instant authentication of identities, service records, and credentials. Leveraging blockchain technology, Datavault AI will mint experiential Valor tokens via a proprietary, military-grade deployment co-developed with Burke, connecting service men and women to their benefits, services, associations, unions, clubs, coupons, discounts and promotions offered by private sector businesses.

 Through Burke Products, an exclusive licensor of Datavault AI technology under a U.S. sole-source government contract—awarded only when no other supplier exists—Datavault AI’s patents ensure unrivaled exclusivity in the U.S. and internationally.

 Roger Stone, a renowned political consultant and public commentator who has advised U.S. presidents, including Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and Donald Trump, on national security and veteran affairs:

 “I strongly support our military, and I’ve had the opportunity to advise multiple presidents and see firsthand how various commanders-in-chief treated our veterans. We can all agree that preventing stolen valor is imperative, and Datavault AI and Arsenal Government and Public Affairs Groups’ campaign to use blockchain technology to verify military records, particularly combat records, is a big step in actualizing the intent of the Stolen Valor Act, and I support their work in Congress. I saw firsthand how the congressional candidacy of Air Force veteran RJ Majewski was damaged when the Associated Press distorted his valid record of service in a combat zone. With Datavault AI, this type of error could be prevented, and veterans would receive the recognition they have earned.”

 The global identity verification market is projected to surpass $50B by 2030, fueled by increasing demand for regulatory compliance, fraud prevention, and digital trust infrastructure. VerifyU extends Datavault AI’s core intellectual property by embedding its patented DataScore® algorithms into defense, government, and consumer-facing applications.

 Frank Mir, Two-time UFC Heavyweight Champion, USA Today Columnist, Sports Commentator, Podcast Host and Senior Adviser to Arsenal Government and Public Affairs Group:

 “Datavault AI is changing the game in credentialing and the VerifyU project in Washington DC is a major cause campaign announcement for standardizing military records. I’ve had the opportunity to train with the U.S. Army at Fort Benning and supporting our men and women in uniform and protecting their valor is a moral imperative. This is a great cause that both political parties should get behind and produce legislation to standardize this technology and be signed into law.”

 Mark Kerr, UFC Champion, Feature The Smashing Machine, Senior Advisor to Arsenal Government and Public Affairs Group based in Washington DC:

 “I am a huge supporter of the United States Military and our Veterans and all the men and women that keep us safe, and very excited to support Datavault AI and Arsenal Government and Public Affairs Group’s effort to bring VerifyU into practice to upkeep the integrity of military records from detracting from our nation’s fiber.”

 Impact of Stolen Valor: Costs and Consequences

 Stolen valor—falsely claiming military honors or service—imposes significant economic and societal costs. In the United States, fraudulent claims tied to stolen valor drain millions annually from veteran benefits programs, with estimates from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs indicating over $100 million in improper payments related to misrepresented service in recent years (source: VA Office of Inspector General reports). This includes fraud in disability compensation, GI Bill education benefits, and hiring preferences, diluting resources for legitimate veterans. Broader economic impacts include reduced wage premiums for actual service members, as misrepresentation erodes the value of military credentials in the job market, potentially costing veterans billions in lost opportunities over time (source: American Law and Economics Review study on stolen valor economics).

 Internationally, military impersonation fraud contributes to global identity theft losses exceeding $50 billion annually, with estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime linking such schemes to organized crime and costing economies up to 1% of GDP in affected sectors like defense contracting and aid programs. In the UK, while not criminalized as broadly as in the US, fraudulent medal-wearing has led to estimated losses of £10-20 million yearly in benefits fraud (source: UK Parliament research briefing on “Stolen Valour”). Globally, the World Economic Forum projects identity fraud costs could reach $8 trillion by 2027, with military-related impersonation amplifying risks in conflict zones and international hiring.

 Stolen valor harms veterans by undermining the integrity of their sacrifices, leading to skepticism toward genuine claims and reduced public support for veteran programs. For instance, during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, impostors claiming combat experience have diverted hiring quotas under the Veterans Preference Act, denying jobs to real veterans like those from the 101st Airborne Division who faced actual combat. This erodes national morale, weakens recruitment efforts, and poses security risks by allowing fraudsters access to sensitive roles, as seen in cases where impostors infiltrated defense contractors. Nationally, it damages trust in institutions, fosters division, and cannot continue without risking further erosion of military honor and public faith in service records.

 Leadership Commentary

 Nathaniel Bradley, CEO of Datavault AI Inc., a veteran technology executive with over 20 years in AI and data security innovations:

 “Honorable Senator David Bradley, my father, served in the U.S. Navy as a cryptologist, and he would have been proud of Datavault AI today, as he had a passion for eliminating stolen valor from our society. We built and patented VerifyU to deliver a scalable, trusted sonic fingerprint enabling real-time verification that is auditable, secure, and aligned with federal compliance frameworks. We believe this product can redefine how markets, governments, and beloved military branches handle credentialing and valor awards.”

 Aaron Bahkshi, an accomplished aerospace inventor and CEO of Burke Products with 55 years of contracting and supplying aerospace and combat technologies for U.S. Army, Air Force, Space Force, Marines, and Navy:

 “From an investor standpoint, VerifyU presents a replicable and scalable technology product in a fast-growing sector. The market is shifting from reactive fraud detection to proactive verification, and Datavault AI is well-positioned to capitalize on this shift with a solution that combines regulatory compliance with commercial opportunity and serious innovation.”

 Sonia Choi, Datavault AI CMO, inventor of acoustic technologies, Lead Principal Investigator on a privately funded strategic partnership project facilitated through the U.S. Department of Energy’s Brookhaven National Laboratory:

 “At Datavault AI, we are deeply humbled to stand alongside our nation’s veterans. Their courage and sacrifice inspire us every day, and through VerifyU tokens, we are honored to help protect the integrity of their service. Our mission is to ensure their dedication is rightfully recognized and celebrated, with technology that safeguards their legacy from misrepresentation.”

 Christopher Neiweem, Iraq War veteran with combat experience in the U.S. Army, founder of Arsenal Government and Public Affairs Group, and a 15-year advocate for veteran health and defense policy in Congress:

 “Over the past 15 years working on policy in Congress to improve veteran health and strengthen defense policies, it’s clear that a bipartisan initiative should follow through to prevent stolen valor. Datavault AI’s VerifyU can achieve this, while also supporting workforce decisions that identify qualified veterans and maintain integrity by preventing imposters. This is an important initiative, and we look forward to engaging Congress and collaborating with partners across the public and private sectors.”
