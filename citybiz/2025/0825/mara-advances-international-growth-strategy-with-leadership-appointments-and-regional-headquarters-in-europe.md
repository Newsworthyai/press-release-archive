 “I decided to join MARA as a Senior Advisor in order to help consolidate the world’s oldest and most successful strategic alliance, the alliance between the United States of America and France,” said Mestrallet. “I will help Fred Thiel and François Garcin align the strengths of MARA’s computing technologies with the global resources of the European energy majors, in particular in electricity generation, in the U.S., in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.”

 Since joining MARA in July, Garcin has been responsible for spearheading the formation of MARA France and MARA Europe and played an instrumental role in securing the Company’s recent investment agreement with Exaion.
