# State Roundup: Moore Asks Trump To Visit B’More; MO CO Braces For Homeless Influx; Council Members Stand By Crandell

‘KEEP OUR NAMES OUT OF YOUR MOUTH”: MOORE DEFENDS B’MORE AGAINST TRUMP: After citing his administration’s gains in Baltimore — a massive decline in gun violence, a new lease for the Baltimore Orioles at Camden Yards and the ongoing effort to redevelop Harborplace — Gov. Wes Moore (D) seized the opportunity to lambaste President Donald Trump (R), who said Baltimore is “so far gone” when it comes to violent crime. Trump made the remarks earlier this month as he mobilized National Guard troops to patrol Washington, D.C. Christine Condon/Maryland Matters.

 MO CO BRACES FOR INFLUX OF HOMELESS AFTER TRUMP ACTION: The encampment near the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., was cleared of its homeless residents on Aug. 14. Many could end up in Maryland, advocates for the region’s homeless population say, straining county budgets and shelters already at capacity. Among those bracing for a possible influx is the state’s largest county, Montgomery, which says its 10 shelters are already full. Jeff Barker/The Baltimore Sun.

 BA CO COUNCIL MEMBERS STAND BY CRANDELL: Members of the Baltimore County Council are rallying around Councilman Todd Crandell, following the release on Wednesday by county police of a June 2024 video showing Crandell clearly drunk, possessing a gun, and being belligerent with officers.

The Trump-backed attorney, who lost Maryland’s 2022 gubernatorial race to Wes Moore, is representing plaintiffs in two federal discrimination lawsuits this year that yank Howard and one of its most powerful institutions right back to the center of an old, yet familiar fault line that divided nearly every community in the country. Lillian Reed/The Baltimore Banner.

 ICE OFFICER LIED ABOUT WARRANT TO ANGRY CROWD: A U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement officer falsely claimed he had a warrant in an attempt to “de-escalate” after a crowd of angry onlookers gathered to protest an increasingly physical arrest of a Honduran man in a Baltimore County strip mall in June, federal prosecutors detailed in a court filing this week.

 TEACHERS WANT THEIR MONEY FROM NONPROFIT THAT HIRED THEM: Maryland teachers who contract with a program that provides arts education in local schools, including in Baltimore City and Baltimore County, are demanding their money after what they call lengthy delays and partial payments.

 WHAT’S THE FUTURE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN MO CO AG RESERVE? The Montgomery County Planning Department touts the county’s Agricultural Reserve as “one of the best examples of land conservation policies in the country.” But some small business owners and county officials say they are concerned that economic development in the 93,000-acre Ag Reserve is being stifled by the way zoning and permitting are regulated by the county.

Dalya Attar (D-Baltimore City). With Moore’s confirmation of her nomination, Attar became the first Orthodox Jewish woman to serve in the Senate. Bryan P. Sears and William J. Ford/Maryland Matters.

 BUSINESSES “STRENUOUSLY OPPOSE” MAYOR SCOTT’S PLAN FOR A TRASH SITE: Businesses located in Baltimore’s Jones Falls Valley – restaurants, a bicycle store and historic mills converted to eateries, shops and apartments – have sent a letter of protest to Mayor Brandon Scott denouncing his proposal to put a city trash facility in their midst.
