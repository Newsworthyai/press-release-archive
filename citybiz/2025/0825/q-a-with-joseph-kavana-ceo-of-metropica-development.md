# Q&amp;A with Joseph Kavana, CEO of Metropica Development

Joseph Kavana, CEO of Metropica Development LLC, is poised to transform the City of Sunrise and western Broward County with his company’s $1.5 billion Metropica project. The master-planned Metropica is approved for 3,000 residential units, 650,000 square feet of office space, 485,000 square feet of retail and two hotels on a 50-acre site located between popular mall Sawgrass Mills and Amerant Bank Arena (home of the two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers).

 Metropica Development previously developed condominium building One Metropica within the Metropica site. The 28-story, 263-residence One Metropica was the product of a creative collaboration between Metropica Development, LLC, internationally renowned architect Chad Oppenheim and London-based interior designer YOO Design Group, founded by John Hitchcox and the celebrated designer Philippe Starck.

 Metropica will bring a true downtown to a city that currently lacks one. With its main-street-like spine with restaurants, shops, plazas and entertainment, it will become a gathering place for families and the focal point of Sunrise

 Metropica recently finalized a landmark agreement in which the developers donated 19 acres of land to the Florida Turnpike Authority via a memorandum with the city. The donation of land adjacent to the Sawgrass Expressway and Pat Salerno Drive was the product of a long-term collaborative effort between the City, Metropica’s development team and other key public and private entities. It allows for the design and construction of a full access interchange at Pat Salerno Drive and the Sawgrass Expressway (State Road 869), with ramps accommodating traffic movements to and from the northbound and southbound visitors and residents.

 What are the components of Metropica, and what is your vision for the project?

 Metropica was conceived as a dream community, a 50-acre, mixed-use development where people can live, work and play without having to travel. We have entitlements to build over 3,000 residential units, 650,000 square feet of office space, 485,000 square feet of retail and two hotels with 240 rooms each. We previously completed our first residential tower, which is nearly sold out. Now, we are ready to launch the next phase, which will include 1,000 luxury rental apartments, a retail plaza with restaurants and entertainment, and one of the two hotels. This will truly establish Metropica as the downtown area of Sunrise, a place where our residents can walk to everything they need.

 

 Metropica is guided by the three principles of Nature, Wellness and Happiness. How have these pillars been incorporated into the project’s design and amenities?

 We believe that these three pillars are fundamental to a great community. Being surrounded by nature and having access to wellness activities promotes happiness. We have designed Metropica with a focus on green spaces and top-tier amenities, such as a state-of-the-art gym, that you wouldn’t find at even the most expensive oceanfront communities. These are the principles guiding the development of Metropica to enhance the lives of its residents.

 You recently finalized a land donation agreement with the City of Sunrise. What was the purpose of this donation?

 We donated approximately 19 acres of land on the west side of the Sawgrass Expressway to the Florida Turnpike Authority via a memorandum with the City, which was a high-cost endeavor to us because it required a change in our stormwater retention plan. We did this so the Florida Department of Transportation could use the land to create a direct access interchange to the expressway, which will tremendously simplify traffic flow from the Amerant Bank Arena. The City was very pleased with this contribution. Our relationship with the City of Sunrise has always been very friendly. They understand the complexity of building a “city within a city” that will ultimately host 16,000 to 18,000 people per day, and the immense planning and coordination required to accomplish that.

 Sunrise is experiencing significant momentum and investment. How will Metropica enhance the broader Sunrise and West Broward community, and what will its role be in the future of the city?

 Metropica will bring a true downtown to a city that currently lacks one. With its main-street-like spine with restaurants, shops, plazas and entertainment, it will become a gathering place for families and the focal point of Sunrise. The city’s current development is primarily suburban, and Metropica will be the only true urban section. When you consider the significant investments being made in the area, such as the new Baptist hospital, the American Express campus, and the Florida Panthers’ new development, Metropica’s $1.5 billion investment solidifies this section of Sunrise as a rapidly growing neighborhood that is in high demand.
