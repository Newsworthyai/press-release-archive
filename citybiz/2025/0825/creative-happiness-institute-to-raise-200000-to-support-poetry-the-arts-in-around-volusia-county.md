# Creative Happiness Institute To Raise $200,000 To Support Poetry &amp; the Arts in &amp; Around Volusia County

A local nonprofit will soon begin a $200,000 fundraising campaign to support the arts and poetry in and around Volusia County, to continue the legacy of Dr. David B. Axelrod, Volusia County’s recently deceased co-poet laureate.

 Creative Happiness Institute, a Daytona Beach-based 501(c)(3) founded by Axelrod 16 years ago to teach, mentor, and promote local poets and artists, will unveil the newly established David B. Axelrod Memorial Endowment Fund at an upcoming Axelrod tribute.

 The Axelrod tribute will be held from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., September 6, at the Dr. Noble “Thin Man” Watts Amphitheatre, located at 322 S. Clara Ave in DeLand. The African American Museum of the Arts is providing the space for these events.

 The tribute’s organizers ask attendees to RSVP to CHI President Anthony Ehrlich by emailing anthonyehrlich@earthlink.net or calling 386-624-4925. Eventgoers can sign up for a first-come, first-served open mic list to recount memories of Axelrod, read poems about him, or read Axelrod’s poems.

 Axelrod’s son, Dr. Dan Axelrod, and Dr. Rajni Shankar-Brown will emcee the event. Jim Graves of Port Orange, a jazz guitarist and professional touring musician, will play live music, and food and beverages will be provided. Following the Axelrod tribute, MainStreet Art and Culture Slam of DeLand, Volusia County’s poetry slam series, will hold a qualifying competition for the Southeast Regional North Carolina Poetry Slam.

 Since Axelrod’s recent passing, Volusia County poets and Axelrod’s children have continued CHI. Donations and grants fund the organization. CHI runs activities such as a Young Poets Mentoring Program, poetry readings and slams, and initiatives for local schools, colleges, arts venues, seniors and veterans. CHI is continuing to publish local poets’ books, too.

 Axelrod’s estate is currently transferring control of Writers Ink Press to CHI. Writers Ink Press is a five-decade-old poetry-focused independent imprint founded by Axelrod. Throughout his life, Axelrod, a Beverly, Massachusetts native, developed a reputation for mentoring countless local poets and authoring 25 poetry books and one award-winning biography of the feminist scholar Merlin Stone.

 Axelrod never stopped teaching after retiring to Daytona in 2010. Yet, he’d already taught 12,000 students as an English professor at SUNY Suffolk County Community College in Selden, New York, from 1969 to 2009. Over his six-decade literary career, Axelrod won dozens of grants, poetry prizes and three Fulbright awards.

 In his spare time, Axelrod founded two nonprofits, multiple literary and real estate businesses, and successfully lobbied Florida’s Legislature to resurrect a statewide poet laureate post. Outside of his career, Axelrod married three times and fathered four children.

 “Despite his many accomplishments, Dr. David Axelrod remained an authentic, humble, generous teacher, who dedicated nearly all of his 81 years to using poetry and the arts to promote happiness, healing and health,” said Anthony Ehrlich, CHI’s new president. “CHI looks forward to continuing to improve local lives by carrying on Dr. Axelrod’s legacy of creativity, laughter, love, artistic mentorship and fellowship.”

 From 2015 till his death, Axelrod served as co-poet laureate, alongside poet M.B. McLatchey, for Volusia County, Florida’s 590,000 residents. From 2007 to 2009, Axelrod was poet laureate for Suffolk County, New York’s 1.5 million residents. Both laureate positions were county government-appointed posts.

 Critics and journalists described Axelrod’s poetry as biographical and anecdotal, and wrote of his penchant for highlighting life’s comedy and irony. Axelrod’s works often focused on family, relationships, friends, current events, politics, places and poetry itself.

 Al Rocheleau, past president of the Florida State Poets Association, aptly dubbed Axelrod a “populist poet,” who covered universal subject matter in a clear, simple style employing subtle figurative features. Axelrod’s imprint, Writers Ink Press, was populist, too, publishing more than 50 books by a diversity of poets.

 Axelrod also tirelessly performed, collaborated and studied with numerous U.S. poet laureates and winners of the National Book Award, the Nobel Prize and the Pulitzer Prize, including Robert Frost, T.S. Eliot, ee cummings, Allen Ginsburg, Billy Collins, Louis Simpson, X.J. Kennedy, Peter Matthiessen, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Robert Bly, Leo Connellan, Galway Kinnell, William Logan, Howard Nemerov, Charles Simic, William Stafford and William Carlos Williams.
