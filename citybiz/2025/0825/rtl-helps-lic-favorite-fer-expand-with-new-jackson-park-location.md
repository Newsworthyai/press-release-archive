# RTL Helps LIC Favorite FER Expand with New Jackson Park Location

FER, the Long Island City restaurant known for its southwest Chinese noodle dishes and other authentic tastes of southwest China, is opening a third neighborhood location — this time inside Jackson Park, Tishman Speyer’s luxury residential development on Jackson Avenue.

 The 2,482-square-foot space marks another step forward for the fast-growing restaurant group, which has built a steady following from its original outposts on 29th Street and Crescent Street. FER’s menu, rooted in family recipes and hometown nostalgia, includes hot and cold noodle dishes, fried rice, and handmade wontons.

 “FER was born out of our desire to serve New York City’s growing communities of diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds, connecting people with intricately made dishes,” said Nigel Huang, owner and founder of FER. “Long Island City has embraced us with open arms since we opened our first location, and we look forward to introducing our comforting and delicious cuisine to even more people very soon.”

 Thomas Galo, EVP and Partner at RTL, represented FER in the 15-year lease at 28-10 Jackson Avenue. Tishman Speyer was represented in-house by Reed Zukerman.

 “I’ve now had the privilege of working with the FER team on two properties and I could not be more thrilled for their continued growth and success,” Galo said. “Long Island City is a vibrant neighborhood and FER only adds to that rich community fabric. With deep experience in the LIC market, I was confident I could find them the best space to fuel their momentum and bring their dishes to even more people.”

 The expansion comes as LIC continues to evolve, with the area’s population growing more than 75 percent over the past decade. That growth has brought with it a steady demand for new local restaurants and retail options.

 Jackson Park, completed in 2019, includes 1,871 apartments across three glass towers, a private park, and more than 120,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor amenities. Its ground floor retail is home to Sweetleaf Coffee Roasters, Dozo Dog, and the recently opened Serafina, and it sits across the street from Tishman Speyer’s 1.2 million-square-foot creative office tower, the JACX.

 With the new Jackson Park location, FER continues to grow alongside the neighborhood it first called home — adding to its footprint in a community that’s embraced it from the start.
