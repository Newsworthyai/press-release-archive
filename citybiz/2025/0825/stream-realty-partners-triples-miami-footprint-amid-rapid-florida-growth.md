# Stream Realty Partners Triples Miami Footprint Amid Rapid Florida Growth

Stream Realty Partners, a national commercial real estate firm offering an integrated platform of services and investment management platform, has signed a long-term lease for a new office space on the 30th floor of Citigroup Center, located at 201 S. Biscayne Blvd. in Downtown Miami. The lease signifies a major milestone in Stream’s Florida growth story, as the firm expands its footprint in the state and cements its long-term presence in South Florida.

 Stream’s new space—of approximately 8,000 square feet—offers a larger footprint to accommodate its current team and provides the capacity to support continued headcount and business line expansion in the near term. The office will be able to house over 50 professionals, allowing Stream to scale its operations as it grows in the region. The space will serve as the strategic hub for the firm’s Miami operations and house professionals across multiple service lines, in both the office and industrial sectors, including tenant representation, landlord representation, capital markets, property management, construction management, and workplace strategy. Stream is expected to move into the new space in the first quarter of 2026.

 “Our decision to expand within Citigroup Center and establish a long-term home for our Miami team reflects the momentum we’ve built in Florida and our commitment to staying at the forefront of the market,” said Greg Katz, Executive Managing Director and Partner at Stream. “The growth we’ve experienced is directly attributable to our collaborative culture and the entrepreneurial spirit of our people. Clients and top talent alike are drawn to Stream because of our values, national resources, and the speed and creativity with which we execute.”

 Since launching in 2023, Stream Florida has grown from just six team members to more than 45 professionals across Miami, Tampa, and Orlando. The group continues to attract top-tier talent from some of the industry’s largest global competitors while scaling its service capabilities across office and industrial real estate.

 “Stream’s growth in Florida has been nothing short of incredible—and we’re just getting started,” said Shay Pope, Managing Director and Executive Vice President at Stream. “Our ability to recruit the best talent in the market, launch new service lines, and compete on the highest level is a direct result of Stream’s unique culture and reputation for delivering results and investing in talent. The new Miami office reflects where we are today and where we’re headed.”

 The firm’s Florida platform has strategically expanded over the last 18 months to offer fully integrated services across the state. Stream launched its Industrial Services division in early 2025, led by Managing Directors and Executive Vice Presidents Steve Medwin and Nick Wigoda, who brought with them more than 6.1 million square feet of industrial leasing assignments in South Florida. In the second quarter of 2025, Stream added Property Management as a service line, further demonstrating its commitment to providing comprehensive solutions to its clients.

 With offices in Miami, Tampa, and Orlando, Stream’s Florida team is positioned to deliver seamless execution and tailored advisory capabilities across the state.
