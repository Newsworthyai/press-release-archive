# VIP Community Services Named One of Newsweek’s Best Addiction Treatment Centers for Third Consecutive Year

VIP Community Services has once again been recognized among Newsweek’s Best Addiction Treatment Centers, earning a place on the 2025 list for the third year in a row. This national recognition highlights VIP’s commitment to delivering high-quality, compassionate care to individuals seeking recovery from addiction.

 Founded in 1974, VIP Community Services provides comprehensive, integrated primary care, behavioral health, housing, vocational, and supportive services that promote the well-being of individuals, families, and communities across the Bronx. VIP addresses systemic issues such as poverty, substance use, unemployment, and housing insecurity with a commitment to dignity, recovery, and empowerment.

 Newsweek, in partnership with Statista, evaluated facilities across the country to identify the top 420 centers—an increase from last year’s 400. Rankings were determined through a comprehensive analysis of four key data sources:

 * National Online Survey of medical professionals, addiction treatment specialists, and facility administrators (55% of total score)
* Accreditation Data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) (35%)
* Care Services Data from SAMHSA (5%)
* Google Reviews from clients and their families (5%)

 The survey focused on the 25 states with the highest number of addiction treatment centers, according to SAMHSA. The remaining states were grouped into four regions. Only inpatient/residential and long-term programs—defined as a minimum of 28–30 days—were considered, with the top 10–18% of eligible facilities in each state or region receiving recognition.

 “This recognition is extremely meaningful, as we must continue working to reduce overdose deaths and other complications related to substance use. It also reflects the resilience and determination of the individuals and families we serve, as well as the unwavering dedication of our staff,” said Debbian Fletcher-Blake, President & CEO of VIP Community Services. “Recovery is an ongoing journey, and we are committed to providing the care and support that people need along the way. We are honored to be recognized among such remarkable organizations and will continue striving to deliver the highest quality care and opportunities for the people we serve to thrive.”
