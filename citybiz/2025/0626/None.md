# Q&amp;A with Sam Wald, CEO of CareMore Health

Sam Wald is the CEO of CareMore Health, a Mosaic Health company. He brings extensive experience in healthcare leadership and operations to the CEO role. His prior leadership experience includes serving as President of Monogram Health’s West Region, Chief Operating Officer at WelbeHealth, and Senior Vice President of Operations at Optum. In these roles he drove both regional and national improvements to clinical outcomes, operational processes, and strategic growth, all while prioritizing a high-touch, proactive approach to patient care delivered by local clinicians in the communities they serve.

 Why CareMore Health? What drew you to the company?

 I was drawn to CareMore because of its 30+ year history of providing healthcare services to the community – especially senior patients. From its founding, CareMore has had a model that empowers local physicians to provide exemplary care to their patients in order to drive outcomes. I share that same passion and it’s an honor to be a part of the CareMore legacy.

 What sets CareMore Health apart from other healthcare organizations?

 So much of what makes CareMore special are the principles that it was founded upon. Putting providers and patients first. Focusing on managing chronic conditions. Coordinating care for the sickest patients. Generally, doing whatever it takes to provide excellent care for patients in the community setting.

 How will your experience at other healthcare organizations play a role in your new position as CEO?

 From the start, we will focus on three things. First, we will emphasize “Team.” Healthcare is a team sport – and a very difficult one. CareMore will be successful because we will come together with a shared identity that creates collaboration across the organization. Second, we will relentlessly support our providers and patients. Our “North Star” will be to put our providers and patients at the center of everything we do, ensuring that we deliver excellent care to as many people as possible. And third, we will be clear about our priorities. We will know what we are driving towards and will hold ourselves accountable to the high standards that our patients expect from us when they entrust us with their care.

 What are the biggest challenges and opportunities you see in healthcare right now, and how is CareMore Health preparing for them?

 I think both the biggest challenge and opportunity is the same as it was when CareMore was founded: how do we prevent and manage chronic conditions in a system that is so often not designed to allow that to happen – either socially or clinically? Doing this requires a true care model that enables providers to focus on the patients that need them the most and gives them the tools that they need to drive to the best clinical outcome for both their patients and their patients’ families. This is at the center of CareMore’s DNA.

 Looking ahead, what trends do you see broadly in the industry that CareMore will help address?

 I think the biggest thing is that patients are going to demand that care to be easy, simple, and affordable. CareMore is going to meet that demand. We are going to be at the forefront by making sure that patients can access care where and when they need it, creating connected relationships with their community providers. This includes meeting patients where they are at – whether it’s in a clinic, virtually, by phone, or in their homes. It also means making sure that when our patients visit our providers that we are able to comprehensively address all of their social and medical needs.
