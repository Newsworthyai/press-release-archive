# Midtown Park and ULTRA Padel Join Forces to Debut the Largest Padel Club in the U.S.

Rosso Development and Midtown Development, in partnership with ULTRA Padel, are thrilled to unveil ULTRA Club Midtown — a vibrant 2-acre pop-up padel destination at the future site of Midtown Park, the $2 billion mixed-use development reimagining nearly five acres in the heart of Midtown Miami. Set to become the largest padel club in the United States, the project marks a bold milestone in the evolution of the sport and a defining addition to the cultural fabric of the neighborhood.

 “Bringing in ULTRA Padel enhances our vision to create vibrant, healthy, and activated public spaces,” said Carlos Rosso, Founder & CEO of Rosso Development. “We are proud to partner with a pioneering brand that truly understands the intersection of wellness, community, and lifestyle.”

 ULTRA Club Midtown will feature 11 state-of-the-art outdoor padel courts and 3 dedicated children’s courts, alongside curated amenities including a food and beverage concept and community programming. As the world’s fastest-growing sport, padel continues to gain momentum globally — and ULTRA Padel, the internationally recognized brand redefining the experience, will infuse this dynamic new destination with its signature energy and innovation.

 “We are excited to introduce a world-class social hub to Miami’s most connected neighborhood,” said Guillermo Barragan, CEO of ULTRA Padel. “This state-of-the-art facility is designed for everyone, from beginners to seasoned players, offering an inviting space to play, socialize, and elevate your game.”

 The premium facility will cater to players of all skill levels and will offer a first look at what’s to come at Midtown Park. ULTRA Padel will also brand and operate the permanent 8-court Racquet & Padel Club at Midtown Park, a centerpiece of the development’s first phase and a major new addition to Miami’s growing racquet sports scene.

 “We are bringing the ULTRA energy to Midtown,” said Nico Clerc, Head of ULTRA Padel Operations. “This hub will be the social country club of the neighborhood, built around an unparalleled club experience.”

 As an integral part of the Midtown Park master plan—which includes thoughtfully designed green spaces, pedestrian paseos, luxury residences, premium office space, gourmet dining, elevated retail, and world-class art programming—the club will introduce high-energy recreational experiences to the broader community, while enhancing the lifestyle of residents at Midtown Park Residences by Proper.

 As the first 28-story tower to be launched, Midtown Park Residences by Proper will offer a collection of 288 stylish residences that seamlessly blend luxury living, world-class hospitality, and dynamic public spaces. With seamless walkability to the Design District and Wynwood, the property is being brought to life by an extraordinary ensemble of leading architects and designers – including Arquitectonica, Meyer Davis Studio, and Naturalficial. Owners gain access to over 40,000 square feet of private amenity spaces, an expansive tropical pool deck with signature restaurant and bar, and wellness offerings including a state-of-the-art fitness center and spa, yoga and meditation garden, and private pickleball court. Residents will also enjoy curated social areas including an art-filled lobby, gourmet coffee bar, events lounge, business center, private party room, kids club, virtual golf simulator and screening room, a communal vegetable garden, plus access to exclusive events across the Proper Hospitality’s portfolio.
