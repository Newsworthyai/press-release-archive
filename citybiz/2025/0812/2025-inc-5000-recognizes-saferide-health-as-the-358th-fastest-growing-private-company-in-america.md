# 2025 Inc. 5000 Recognizes SafeRide Health as the 358th Fastest-Growing Private Company in America

Inc., the leading media brand and playbook for the entrepreneurs and business leaders shaping our future, today announced that SafeRide Health is ranked No. 358 on the 2025 Inc. 5000 list, placing it among the top 7% of the fastest-growing private companies in America. SafeRide also earned distinctions as No. 5 in the San Antonio metro area, No. 40 in Texas, and No. 41 in the healthcare sector nationally. The Inc. 5000 provides a data-driven snapshot of the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Past honorees include companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Chobani, Under Armour, Timberland, Oracle, and Patagonia.

 “We’re honored to be named to the Inc. 5000 list, let alone to the top 500,” said Robbins Schrader, CEO and Co-Founder of SafeRide Health. “We’ve built a team that shows up every day for the members of our partner health plans. This recognition is a tribute to their grit, to their hard work, and to the mission we share: fixing healthcare by getting people to care.”

 SafeRide Health’s ranking reflects more than just scale; it represents a transformation in how health plans are closing the gap between healthcare need and access. The company delivers more than 10 million rides annually across all 50 states, partnering with leading Medicaid and Medicare Advantage plans to serve members who depend on timely, reliable, and compliant non-emergency medical transportation. Unlike legacy brokers, SafeRide was built from the ground up to solve problems of fragmentation, missed care, and fraud, waste, and abuse (read related case study). It boasts industry-leading performance metrics, including 99% ride fulfillment and grievance rate below 0.25% of rides, and a platform that combines real-time eligibility, smart trip orchestration, and a credentialed national network to turn transportation into a care-experience lever. That people-first approach has earned national recognition, including a 2025 USA Today Top Workplace award as well as Top Workplace awards for Professional Development, Employee Well-Being, Culture Excellence, and Remote Work—affirming SafeRide’s culture as a key driver of its growth and operational excellence.

 This year’s Inc. 5000 honorees have demonstrated exceptional growth while navigating economic uncertainty, inflationary pressure, and a fluctuating labor market. Among the top 500 companies on the list, the median three-year revenue growth rate reached 1,552 percent, and those companies have collectively added more than 48,678 jobs to the U.S. economy over the past three years.

 “Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” says Mike Hofman, editor in chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm—they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”

 Inc. will celebrate the honorees at the 2025 Inc. 5000 Conference & Gala, taking place October 22–24 in Phoenix, and the top 500 will be listed in the Fall issue of Inc. magazine.
