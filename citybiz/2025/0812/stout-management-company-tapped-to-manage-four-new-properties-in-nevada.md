# Stout Management Company Tapped to Manage Four New Properties in Nevada

Stout Management Company is expanding its Nevada multifamily management portfolio by more than 300 units, adding Southern Nevada apartment management and leasing assignments at four properties in Las Vegas.

 Stout is overseeing management and leasing of the Village of Santo Domingo, a 120-unit community developed between 1997 and 2000 at 8530 W Sahara Ave. adjacent to the western portion of Summerlin. The property has a mix of one- and two-bedroom apartments.

 Also in Las Vegas, Stout is handling the management of the Lennox Las Vegas, a 100-unit community constructed in 2015 at 430 E Cactus Ave. near the vibrant heart of the city. The property, in the Silverado Ranch neighborhood, has a mix of one-, two, and three-bedroom apartments.

 “The Lennox Las Vegas is a luxury apartment community that bolsters Stout’s already strong portfolio of Vegas properties,” said Stout Management Company President Taylor Verhaalen.

 In April, Stout took over management and leasing of Harlow in Las Vegas, a 98-unit community located at 10620 West Alexander Rd. on nearly 5 acres. Built in 2003, the 13-building property comprises one-, two- and three-bedroom units. The community is 16 miles from the city’s downtown and 8 miles from North Las Vegas Airport.

 “Demand for these properties is extremely high and the team is prepared to provide exceptional living experiences for the residents of those communities as well as the residents,” said Verhaalen.
