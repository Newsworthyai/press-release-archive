# Level Access Among America’s Top 300 Fastest-Growing Software Companies in 2025 An Inc. Announcement

Level Access, the category leader in digital accessibility solutions, announced today that it has once again been named among the fastest-growing private companies in America by Inc. This is the ninth year Level Access has been recognized in the Inc. 5000, an annual ranking of high-growth independent businesses. This year, the company ranked at number 279 in the software category, following in the paths of past tech honorees such as Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta.

 “We are incredibly proud to be one of the fastest-growing private companies in the U.S. market,” said Mark Zablan, CEO of Level Access. “We know that our continued growth is not just about us—it’s a signal that the global business community is more committed than ever to meeting the needs of people with disabilities. Organizations are increasingly embracing digital accessibility as a key driver of creativity, innovation, and revenue.”

 Level Access’s unique end-to-end solution allows organizations to create and maintain accessible websites, mobile apps, platforms, and more—a task made even more intuitive and efficient by the company’s growing investments in agentic AI. With Level Access’s AI-powered software, teams can automate many aspects of accessibility in development and testing, providing inclusive experiences at scale without additional resources.

 “Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” says Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm—they grew through it.”

 In addition to its demonstrated leadership in North America, Level Access is expanding its established regional presence across the European Union, deepening its support for European organizations facing new regulatory requirements and rising demand for accessible digital experiences.
