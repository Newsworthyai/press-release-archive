# ReSource Pro Achieves Rare Growth Recognition — Earns 16th Inc. 5000 Ranking, Top 0.02% All-Time, and 10th Largest

ReSource Pro, a leading strategic operations partner to the insurance industry, has once again been named to the Inc. 5000 list, an annual ranking of the fastest-growing privately held companies in the United States. This marks the 16th time that ReSource Pro has earned this distinction, making it one of only eight companies to do so — and the only one exclusively serving insurance — placing it in the top 0.02% of all-time, repeat honorees.

 This year, Inc. also recognized ReSource Pro as the 10th largest company on the list by employee count. Founded in 2003, ReSource Pro has grown from fewer than 700 employees when it first made the list in 2009 to over 12,000 team members today. From 16 global offices both on and offshore, the company services a client base of more than 2000+ insurance carriers, MGAs, Wholesalers, and Brokers.

 “To be named to Inc. 5000 for the 16th time reflects the trust we’ve built with our clients for quality and service,” said Dan Epstein, CEO of ReSource Pro. “We’ve scaled not by chasing growth for growth’s sake, but by creating long-term value. Every day, we help clients optimize their business with a sharp focus on often-overlooked details that drive — and sustain — operational efficiency and a scalable approach to digital readiness and AI execution.”

 Client satisfaction remains a strength for the organization. An EVP from a large broker recently cited, “ReSource Pro exceeds expectations in insurance-specific functions; their flexible and customizable models are an asset.”

A mid-sized MGA executive echoed the sentiment, saying, “ReSource Pro is extremely accurate and can handle highly complex tasks. They are widely recognized as the preferred choice given their ability to maintain accuracy rates above 99%.”

 This year’s Inc. 5000 honorees have demonstrated exceptional growth while navigating economic uncertainty, inflationary pressure, and a fluctuating labor market. “Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” said Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm — they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”
