# Symphion Recognized as a Key Player in Quocirca’s Print Security Landscape 2025 Report

Symphion, Inc., the world leader in print fleet cyber security, today announced its inclusion in Quocirca’s Print Security Landscape 2025 report. The independent analyst report identifies Symphion as the key player that “distinguishes itself by directly addressing the pervasive and costly problem of securing heterogeneous print environments.”

 The report highlights Symphion’s pioneering Print Fleet Cyber Security as a Service offering, which brings comprehensive protection to printer endpoints through robust automation, continuous monitoring, and real-time compliance enforcement across enterprise print infrastructures. Symphion’s unique focus on delivering managed cybersecurity outcomes—rather than simply providing toolkits for self-management—positions the company as a trusted partner in today’s rapidly evolving threat landscape.

 “With cyberattacks increasingly targeting overlooked endpoints like networked printers, organizations can no longer afford to treat printer security as an afterthought,” said Jim LaRoe, CEO of Symphion. “We’re honored to be recognized by Quocirca for our role in protecting print fleets for some of the world’s most risk-aware enterprises.”

 Quocirca’s annual report evaluates leading vendors on both strategic vision and technical capability across areas including policy enforcement, vulnerability remediation, device hardening, and regulatory compliance. According to the 2025 findings, print security remains a critical blind spot for many IT and security leaders—despite increased investment in broader endpoint protection strategies. In fact, the report found that 56 percent of the organizations surveyed reported a print-related data loss in the past year.

 “Previous Quocirca studies have identified multi-vendor fleet security weakness, and this year’s findings indicate that the gap is increasing,” said Louella Fernandes, CEO of Quocirca. “New printers and MFPs are increasingly connected and sophisticated, but legacy devices remain an important part of many companies’ print infrastructure. Integrating these older devices with centralized security management platforms can be difficult, while maintaining patches and updates is an administrative burden.”

 Symphion’s inclusion in the report reflects growing demand for specialized, automated print fleet security as part of enterprise cyber hygiene. The company’s Print Fleet Cyber Security as a Service enables organizations to enforce security policies at scale, mitigate configuration drift, and maintain audit readiness—without burdening and no operational lift for internal teams.

 “Symphion is delivering a highly focused, technology-enabled program that combines purpose-built technologies, experienced professionals, and proven processes to ensure printer endpoints are protected and compliant by default,” added LaRoe. “This is far more than a tool or product—it’s a fully managed service model that includes embedded program management to address the wide variance in cybersecurity maturity across enterprises. Symphion’s unique approach aligns well with zero-trust initiatives and ongoing risk management needs.”
