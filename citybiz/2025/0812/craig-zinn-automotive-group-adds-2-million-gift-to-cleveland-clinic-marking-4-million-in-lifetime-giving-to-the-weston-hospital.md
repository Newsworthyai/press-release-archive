 Made in honor of Nabil Tadross, MD, medical director of Cleveland Clinic’s Concierge Medicine program for Fort Lauderdale and Weston, the new $2 million gift includes $1 million contributed in 2024 and another $1 million in 2025. The 3,920-square-foot suite is located at the Weston Corporate Center, 2500 Weston Rd., Suite 100 in Weston.

 “Supporting Cleveland Clinic’s commitment to innovation and patients-first care is a personal passion of mine,” said Mr. Zinn. “This suite brings world-class, personalized medicine closer to home for South Florida residents, and I’m proud to play a role in advancing its mission.”

 To recognize Mr. Zinn for his gift, a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new suite was held on Friday, Aug. 8, at 11:30 a.m., at Weston Corporate Center.

 “We are deeply grateful to Mr. Zinn for enabling the construction of our state-of-the-art Concierge Medicine Suite in Weston,” said Stephen Avallone, MD, director of the Cleveland Clinic Center of Concierge Medicine. “His generous support allows us to continue providing the high-quality care our patients have come to know and trust here in Broward County.”
