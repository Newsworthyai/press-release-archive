 MOORE’s POLL NUMBERS SLIP FOR DEMOCRATIC VOTERS: Half of Marylanders give positive marks to Gov. Wes Moore’s performance in office, according to a new poll from two Annapolis-based advocacy firms. The approval represents a slight slip for the Democratic governor, who has topped 50% approval in polls since taking office in January 2023. Just 68% of Democrats said Moore, who is seeking reelection next year, is doing an “excellent” or “good” job. Pamela Wood/The Baltimore Banner.

 LATEST DRAFT OF BAY PACT CRITICIZED FOR LACK OF GOALS, ACCOUNTABILITY: The newest draft of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement lacks meaningful pollution reduction targets and allows states to evade legal accountability, say concerned environmental advocates and experts who have reviewed the document. Released for public comment on July 1, the current draft is intended to chart the future course of bay restoration efforts beyond 2025. Aman Azhar, of Inside Climate News/The Baltimore Banner.

 MDOT SEEKS PROPOSALS FOR BOWIE MARC STATION AREA: The Maryland Department of Transportation has begun its search for development proposals for revamping the area around the Bowie State MARC station. As part of a broader plan to boost ridership and expand development along the MARC Penn Line Corridor, spanning from Union Station in Washington, D.C., through Baltimore’s Penn Station and ending in Perryville, the state is hoping to build affordable or mixed-income housing on an underused parking lot near the Bowie State station.

 FLEEING CHAOS IN CAMEROON, NOW LIVING IN UNCERTAINTY: Maryland has the largest population of Cameroonian nationals in the country, with more than 29,000 who fled the gunfire and chaos of Cameroon. In 2021, Ernestine and Denis fled and have created a sense of normal life in Maryland. They found a home to raise their three children and jobs as caregivers. The couple became beneficiaries of Temporary Protected Status, created by Congress in 1990. It grants temporary protection to nationals of countries affected by war or natural disasters. That ended on Aug. 4. Tolu Talabi/The Baltimore Banner.

 HAITIANS FOUND A LIFELINE IN MARYLAND’s POULTRY INDUSTRY: The region’s poultry industry and the local economy that has flourished around it have been a lifeline to Haitian immigrants who have settled on the Eastern Shore. But the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration crackdown has left a cloud of anxiety over Salisbury, where many in a fast-growing Haitian community now worry that everything they’ve built will collapse if thousands in the area are deported or otherwise forced to leave. Paul Kiefer/The Washington Post.

 MARYLAND’s NEW CONGRESS MEMBERS GOVERN FROM THE SIDELINES: Newly elected lawmakers like freshman Rep. Johnny Olszewski Jr. enter Congress as powerful people. They are, after all, one of the 535 or so people shaping the laws that govern day-to-day American life. But influence on Capitol Hill — often rooted in a mix of money and relationships — doesn’t grow overnight. In reality, most new members arrive in D.C. at the bottom of a messy heap. That’s especially true for members who arrive in the minority party, as Olszewski and most Maryland members are. Ben Mause/The Baltimore Sun.

 VAN HOLLEN TO HEADLINE MAJOR DEM FUND-RAISER: Sen. Chris Van Hollen is heading to Iowa next month to speak at a high-profile fundraiser known for bringing in big-name Democrats. The Polk County Democrats’ annual steak fry draws party faithful from across the country and often a national spotlight. Chair Bill Brauch said Van Hollen was “a big get.” Brenda Wintrode/The Baltimore Banner.

 TAX FREE WEEK EXPECTED TO COST STATE $9.3 MILLION: Maryland tax-free week, an annual tax holiday that removes the 6% sales tax from clothing and shoes under $100, starts Sunday. And while it’s touted as a way to offer families the opportunity to shop at a reduced cost, it also yields a revenue loss for the state – projected to be about $9.3 million this year. Gabriella Fine/The Baltimore Sun.

 JEWISH LEADERS CONDEMN NEA HANDBOOK CHANGES AS ANTISEMITIC: Jeffrey Herf, an emeritus history professor at the University of Maryland, sees the National Education Association’s take on history as echoing the kind of thinking that has helped lay the groundwork for unthinkable mass tragedy — and he believes it’s especially dangerous at a time when antisemitic acts are surging in Baltimore, across Maryland, and throughout the United States. Jonathan Pitts/The Baltimore Sun.

 MAN CHARGED WITH VANDALISM OF ISRAELI FLAGS, ISRAELI BUSINESS: Baltimore County police have charged a 39-year-old man in what they describe as a targeted act of vandalism involving Israeli flags in the Falls Road area. Police said Jonathon Wagner faces multiple counts of malicious destruction of property, including one charge tied to race or religion, stemming from the Aug. 6 incident in the 6000 block of Falls Road, police announced Saturday. Todd Karpovich/The Baltimore Sun.

 * Wagner has been charged in connection with vandalism that left an Israeli-owned kitchen renovation business covered in red spray paint, according to Baltimore County Police. He is facing multiple malicious destruction of property charges, including one based on race and religious. Clara Longo de Freitas/The Baltimore Banner.

 CARROLL PROPOSAL WOULD REQUIRE LICENSING FOR ‘CAT COLONIES:’ A proposal to require “cat colonies” in Carroll County to be licensed and regulated drew criticism from cat caretakers at a county hearing Thursday. The proposal would create an authority for licensing of cats by adding a definition for a “trap-neuter-release colony.” It would also add some dog-related rules, including banning people from tethering dogs outside for more than eight hours at a time. Bryna Zumer/The Carroll County Times.

 STATE ED DEPT AFFIRMS MO CO FIRING OF PRINCIPAL: The Maryland State Department of Education has affirmed the 2024 termination of former middle school Principal Joel Beidleman by the Montgomery County school board, denying his appeal that claimed an administrative judge’s decision violated his due process rights, according to a June 27 department opinion. Ashlyn Campbell/Bethesda Today.

 FORMER NAVY ANALYST FILES TO RUN FOR ARUNDEL COUNCIL: A former Naval language analyst, software engineer and part-time pro bono lawyer has filed paperwork to be a candidate for the District 2 seat on the Anne Arundel County Council for 2026. Cory Malinowski, a Severn Republican and political newcomer, said he intends to bring a long-term approach to a district undergoing several revitalization and development projects. James Matheson/The Capital Gazette.

 COLUMN: LOYALTY OVER MERIT AT THE NAVAL ACADEMY: I hope Samara Firebaugh has updated her résumé. In a two-page memo last month, Navy Secretary John Phelan outlined President Donald Trump’s next step toward a military dictatorship, in which loyalty to the commander-in-chief matters most for anyone in uniform.It pushes Firebaugh, academic dean and provost at the Naval Academy for two years, to the front of the line for getting fired. Rick Hutzell/The Baltimore Banner.
