# What’s the Future of Swann Park in South Baltimore?

The original master plan for the Port Covington development, which now goes by Baltimore Peninsula, was revealed in January 2016. It showed Swann Park being replaced with new blocks and the athletic fields being relocated to an expanded West Covington Park. Now nine and a half years later, the 11-acre Swann Park is still there and its future is still being discussed.

 Swann Park has been a park for sports in South Baltimore for many decades. It was closed in 2007 after it was found to be contaminated with arsenic and later reopened in 2010 after remediation and a renovation was completed.

 The park includes a full-size baseball field named Al Kaline Field, a football/soccer field, and two fields for softball or youth baseball. The park also has a closed bath and field house, as well as adjacent parking.

 A monument was installed at Swann Park in 2019 to honor the former Mayor, Governor, and Congressman Thomas Swann, who is the namesake for Swann Park, as well as the history of the 19u amateur baseball team that played at the park. This notable team had more than 175 future professional baseball players take the field. This monument was spearheaded by local baseball enthusiasts who wanted to make sure the history of baseball at the park was commemorated before any major changes were made. The plaque was designed so that it can be moved if the park is relocated.

 Al Kaline Field is named after the late Baseball Hall of Famer. Kaline grew up in the nearby South Baltimore neighborhood of Westport and played high school baseball at the former Southern High School in Federal Hill.

 An email began circulating in April by the Baltimore Peninsula Development team, which is comprised of MAG Partners and MacFarlane Partners, in partnership with Sagamore Ventures and the Urban Investment Group within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. The email provided a template to submit letters of support to Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott on a land swap between Swann Park, which is owned by Baltimore City, and West Covington Park, which is owned by the Baltimore Peninsula Development team.
