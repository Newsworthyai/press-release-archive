# K9 Resorts Debuts on Inc. 5000 List Amid Record Franchise Growth

In the midst of a record-breaking year for franchise growth, K9 Resorts Luxury Pet Hotel has debuted on the 2025 Inc. 5000 list at No. 1924. This prestigious honor recognizes the fastest-growing private companies in the U.S. and underscores K9 Resorts’ momentum in franchise expansion, operational innovation, and category leadership within the luxury dog boarding and daycare space.

 This year’s Inc. 5000 honorees have demonstrated exceptional growth over the past three years while maintaining strong reputations. Earning a spot on this list places K9 Resorts among the most dynamic and resilient companies in the country.

 Despite economic uncertainty, inflationary pressures, and a fluctuating labor market, K9 Resorts is on track for its strongest year of franchise development to date. Highlights from 2025 so far include:

 * 27 new franchise licenses sold
* Five new resorts have opened
* 25 – 30 additional openings expected over the next 18 months

 “Landing on the Inc. 5000 is more than an honor, it’s a clear signal that what we’re building is truly special and resonates with pet parents,” said Jason Parker, Co-CEO and Co-Founder of K9 Resorts. “From day one, our mission has been to raise the bar in pet care, and this recognition is proof that our franchisees, team, and guests believe in our vision.”

 Parker credits K9 Resorts’ standout year to several key factors:

 * Strategic Franchise Development: The brand has welcomed a slate of impressive new franchisees, from high-end hotel owners to the founder of Bombas socks. These new owners are well-capitalized, passionate about pet care, and aligned with K9 Resorts’ commitment to operational excellence.
* Strong Field Support: A new team of experienced regional directors has brought enhanced field support to franchisees, ensuring strong openings and consistent performance systemwide.
* Technological Advancements: K9 Resorts is modernizing its tech stack across the enterprise and preparing to unveil exclusive features that will elevate the guest experience.
* Innovative Programming: K9 Resorts has rolled out a series of engaging activations in 2025, including Canine Fitness Month and the widely popular Summer Camp, with more campaigns planned through the end of the year.
* Strategic Partnerships: A new joint venture with one of K9’s largest franchisees is fueling the expansion and management of the brand’s formerly company-owned resorts, allowing the K9 corporate team to focus on driving franchisee success.

 “As leaders in pet hospitality, we’re always looking ahead,” said Parker. “We’re not content with the status quo; we’re building the future of the pet resort experience and are excited for what’s to come.”

 The foundation of K9 Resorts is rooted in a passion for pets, as the Parker brothers were only 14 and 12 years old when they launched their first dog walking business. Their venture quickly took off which further inspired them to build a career within the pet industry, and a few years later, the first K9 Resorts location opened in 2005. Grounded in their commitment to excellence, compassion, and innovation, the brand has grown into a nationally recognized leader in luxury pet care.

 With pet ownership continuing to increase and more than 50% of U.S. households owning a dog (64 million), the demand for pet services is greater than ever. K9 Resorts is meeting that demand with the unmatched quality of its services and facilities, and is poised to further dominate the sector and maintain its position as an industry leader.

 K9 Resorts is actively seeking single and multi-unit owners to bring luxury pet boarding and daycare to their community.
