# Celebrating Black Business Month: Sandy Collier of Hey, Sandy! PR Champions Black Voices Through Media and Storytelling

August marks National Black Business Month, a time to celebrate and support the dynamic contributions of Black-owned businesses across the country. From innovation and entrepreneurship to cultural and economic impact, Black-owned businesses continue to be vital drivers of growth and community empowerment.

 In celebration of this important month, meet Sandy Collier, founder and CEO of Hey, Sandy! PR & Communications — a proud Bahamian American, newsroom veteran, mother of six, and true media matchmaker on a mission to amplify the stories of Black-owned businesses and nonprofits across South Florida and beyond.

 Born and raised in the Bahamas, Sandy’s passion for storytelling began after Hurricane Andrew devastated South Florida in 1992. While volunteering to support affected families, she encountered a FOX News crew — a moment that sparked her interest in journalism and led to her first newsroom internship. That spark ignited a two-decade career in broadcast news, where Sandy held roles at WSVN Channel 7, NewsRadio 610 WIOD, WLWT in Cincinnati, and WPEC in West Palm Beach, where she ran the assignment desk.

 

 Throughout her journalism career, Sandy covered major national events including the Elian Gonzalez custody saga, the Palm Beach “Hanging Chad” controversy, and local reactions to the 9/11 attacks. She even made headlines herself when she gave birth to her fifth child in the back of a news car.

 In 2017, after her husband passed away and her son faced a serious health scare, Sandy made the courageous decision to leave the newsroom and pursue her lifelong dream: launching her own PR firm. That dream became reality with the founding of Hey, Sandy! PR & Communications — a proudly Black woman-owned business based in Wellington, Florida, specializing in public relations for Black-owned small businesses and nonprofits.

 With more than 20 years of newsroom experience and a degree from St. Thomas University, Sandy brings a rare blend of storytelling intuition and insider media knowledge. She understands how newsrooms work — and more importantly, how to position her clients so their stories get told.

 “My goal is to get the spotlight on local businesses — big or small, corporate or homegrown,” says Collier. “Whether it’s on TV, in the newspaper, or on the radio — I’m the one to call.”

 Hey, Sandy! PR & Communications is built on values of innovation, collaboration, and diversity. Sandy’s client roster includes businesses and nonprofits that are often overlooked in traditional media — and her mission is to make high-quality, personalized PR accessible to those who may have thought it was out of reach. She is widely regarded as a media insider with a knack for crafting pitches that land — and a trusted connector between South Florida’s Black business community and the press.

 Sandy also gives back through community service projects and fundraising efforts for causes close to her heart, especially those supporting The Bahamas and Caribbean diaspora. As a mother of six and a passionate community leader, she continues to use her platform to empower others through storytelling.
