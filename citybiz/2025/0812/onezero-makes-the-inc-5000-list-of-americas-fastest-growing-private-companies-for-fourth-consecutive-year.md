# oneZero Makes The Inc. 5000 List Of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies For Fourth Consecutive Year

Inc., the leading media brand and playbook for the entrepreneurs and business leaders shaping our future, today announced that oneZero Financial Systems has reached the 2025 Inc. 5000 list of the fastest-growing private companies in America. This is the fourth consecutive year that oneZero has made the prestigious ranking.

 The Inc. 5000 list provides a data-driven snapshot of the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment – its independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Past honorees include companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Chobani, Under Armour, Timberland, Oracle, and Patagonia.

 Andrew Ralich, CEO and Co-Founder of oneZero commented: “Jesse and I are deeply honored and excited that the firm we launched 15 years ago has earned a spot on the Inc. 5000 list for the fourth year in a row. This continued recognition reflects the relentless commitment of our incredible team to building resilient, client-driven, and scalable capital markets technology. We’re grateful to our clients and partners for their trust and collaboration, and we remain focused on evolving with their needs through ongoing innovation. Thank you to everyone who’s been part of this journey.”

 This year’s Inc. 5000 honorees have demonstrated exceptional growth while navigating economic uncertainty, inflationary pressure, and a fluctuating labor market. Among the top 500 companies on the list, the median three-year revenue growth rate reached 1,552 percent, and those companies have collectively added more than 48,678 jobs to the U.S. economy over the past three years.

“Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” says Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm – they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”
