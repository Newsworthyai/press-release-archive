ARLINGTON, Texas–(BUSINESS WIRE)–AOM Infusion, a leading national provider of specialty infusion and pharmacy services, has been named to the annual Inc. 5000 list, recognizing the nation’s fastest-growing private companies. AOM ranks No. 2,566 based on a three-year revenue growth of 175 percent. The list provides a data-driven snapshot of the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses.

 “It’s an incredible honor to be recognized by Inc. as one of the fastest-growing companies in the country,” said Keyur Mehta, AOM Infusion CEO. “Our growth has been a true testament to the strength of our focus on quality, clinical excellence, technology-forward care, and relentless drive to deliver personalized service that improves outcomes and enhances life.”

 AOM continues to expand its clinical footprint and capabilities, driven by a commitment to innovation, collaboration, and operational excellence. Recently, the company opened new state-of-the-art facilities in Brooklyn, NY, and Arlington, TX to meet rising demand and support geographic growth. The company has also expanded access to vital infusion therapies across the Southwest, Pacific Northwest, and Midwest through strong collaboration with local health care providers, health systems, and payors. To support this growth, AOM has significantly scaled its team, investing in top talent across Clinical, Operations, Technology, and Leadership to maintain a high-touch, outcomes-driven model of care.

 “Every part of our team plays a role in driving AOM’s success,” said John Vlahopoulos, AOM Infusion Chief Clinical Officer. “Our collaborative and transparent approach, ensuring alignment between the clinical team, physician, and patient, is what makes our model so effective. That shared commitment to quality and communication is the foundation of our sustained growth.”
