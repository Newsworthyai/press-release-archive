# Nursa Named to 2025 Inc. 5000 List of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies

Inc., the leading media brand and playbook for the entrepreneurs and business leaders shaping our future, today announced that Nursa, a Salt Lake City-based platform that exists to place a nurse at the bedside of every patient in need, has placed in the top third – No. 1504 – on the annual Inc. 5000 list, the most prestigious ranking of the fastest-growing private companies in America.

 The list provides a data-driven snapshot of the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment: its independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Companies on the 2025 Inc. 5000 must be U.S.-based, privately held, for-profit, and independent—not subsidiaries or divisions of other companies—and are ranked according to percentage revenue growth from 2021 to 2024. This year’s Inc. 5000 honorees have demonstrated exceptional growth while navigating economic uncertainty, inflationary pressure, and a fluctuating labor market.

 “This recognition reflects more than rapid acceleration of our mission and reach—it’s about the direction the healthcare staffing industry is headed toward and the incredible partnerships and people that have driven this success,” said Curtis Anderson, CEO and founder of Nursa. “Growth is more meaningful when it’s predicated on purpose, and we’re just getting started.”

 “Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” says Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm—they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”

Inc. will celebrate the honorees at the 2025 Inc. 5000 Conference & Gala, taking place Oct. 22–24 in Phoenix, and the top 500 will be listed in the Fall issue of Inc. magazine.

 Founded in 2019 from the bedrock foundation of Lake Bonneville, Nursa removes the financial strain and operational gaps of traditional staffing methods. Nursa’s real-time technology enables hospitals, health systems and SNFs to easily secure qualified, local nursing talent for per diem shifts. The platform is trusted by a growing community of more than 3,400 facilities and 400,000 nurses nationwide and is accredited by The Joint Commission.
