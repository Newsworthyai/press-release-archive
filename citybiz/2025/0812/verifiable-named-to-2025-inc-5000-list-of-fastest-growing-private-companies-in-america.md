# Verifiable Named to 2025 Inc. 5000 List of Fastest-Growing Private Companies in America

Inc. magazine today revealed that Verifiable, the industry-leading healthcare credentialing and monitoring platform, was named to the annual Inc. 5000 list, the most prestigious ranking of the fastest-growing private companies in America. Demonstrating significant growth, the company was listed No. 27 among software companies nationally, and No. 12 in the Austin, Texas region.

 The Inc. 5000 list provides a data-driven snapshot of the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Past honorees include companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Chobani, Under Armour, Timberland, Oracle, and Patagonia.

 “Over the past several years, we’ve been laser-focused on building an enterprise-grade platform for healthcare organizations to streamline provider operations and ensure compliance at scale, ultimately improving clinician experiences and access to quality care,” said Nick Macario, CEO of Verifiable. “Today’s recognition is a testament to the dedication of our team and the real-world impact our technology is making for our customers, and the healthcare industry as a whole.”

 This year’s Inc. 5000 honorees have demonstrated exceptional growth while navigating economic uncertainty, inflationary pressure, and a fluctuating labor market. Among the top 500 companies on the list, the median three-year revenue growth rate reached 1,552 percent, and those companies have collectively added more than 48,678 jobs to the U.S. economy over the past three years.

 “Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” says Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm—they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”

Verifiable’s robust enterprise architecture, real-time credential verifications and monitoring, and streamlined workflows are essential to ensure data is organized, accessible, and primed for intelligent action. The company’s relentless focus on innovation since day one has shaped a proven platform that combines a data-rich engine and deep expertise, laying the foundation for end-to-end AI-powered intelligence in the coming months.

 “We started by helping customers achieve immediate seven-figure cost savings and up to a 98% reduction in credentialing turnaround times through traditional automation,” said Brett Dooies, Head of Product at Verifiable. “Now, we’re advancing to the next phase: building a smarter, AI-powered system that intelligently interprets, compares, and flags discrepancies across the entire credentialing lifecycle. With human oversight, these capabilities will drive even greater efficiency, accuracy, and compliance—especially for teams facing growing demands with limited resources.”
