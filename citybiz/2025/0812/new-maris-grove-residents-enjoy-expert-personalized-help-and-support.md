# New Maris Grove Residents Enjoy Expert, Personalized Help and Support

Maris Grove, an Erickson Senior Living community in the Brandywine Valley of Pennsylvania, offers more than just a vibrant lifestyle. It offers a seamless, worry-free move, thanks to expert guidance from Planning and Moving Consultant Jan Schechter.

 Whether helping prospective residents downsize or connecting them with trusted professionals, Schechter’s mission is simple: Provide support through every step of the moving process.

 “Once someone has joined the Priority List, I reach out to give them a roadmap and help them understand how the process works. That early planning provides peace of mind,” says Schechter. “My goal is to make your move as easy as possible!”

 Personalized support

 A cornerstone of Schechter’s personalized approach is the in-home visit.

 “I walk through their house with them, measure the furniture they want to bring, and we work together on a space plan,” Schechter explains. “Most people are pleasantly surprised by how much fits–and how much their new home can reflect the one they’re leaving, if they like.”

 For Alex and Renee Rockaway, their in-home visit was a game changer. “Jan did some initial layouts for us,” says Alex. “It helped us see how the new apartment would function for our lifestyle.”

 Though Alex and Renee opted to buy new furniture, Schechter still played a key role in helping them visualize and personalize their space.

 As a result of their collaborative planning, the Rockaways’ residence at Maris Grove–a two-bedroom, two-bath floor plan with a sunroom, storage room, and laundry–turned out to be a perfect fit.

 Trusted partners

 Schechter can also connect Priority List members with preferred vendors–local real estate agents, moving companies, senior move managers, downsizing specialists, and more–to streamline their moves.

 “I usually give people two real estate agents to speak with, so they can choose who they feel most comfortable with,” she says. “These agents know the area and the market and understand the specific needs of our future residents.”

 “We talked to Jan to get some idea of what we needed to do–find a mover, a packer, that kind of thing,” recalls Alex. “Jan gave us a list, and we started looking into it all.”

 Alex and Renee called a real estate agent Schechter recommended. “She was professional, responsive, and everything went smoothly,” he says.

 Schechter also recommended a moving company. “They packed and moved everything for us–and nothing was broken or lost,” says Alex. “They were phenomenal. That took a big worry off our chest.”

 Plan ahead!

 Schechter emphasizes that early preparation makes all the difference.

 “Planning ahead is all about removing obstacles,” she says. “Whether it’s deferring maintenance, lightening your load through downsizing, or working with a move manager, every step you take now makes the move easier later.”

 She also advises Priority List members not to list their home until they’ve reserved a residence at Maris Grove.

 “The housing market around us is strong, and homes are selling quickly. It’s best to wait until you know exactly where you’re going,” she explains.

 Alex agrees, saying, “Think about how you live and design your new home around that. Be creative! We divided our second bedroom into storage and an office. Renee uses the sunroom as her workspace. It’s set up for our convenience, not for show.”

 A lifestyle worth the move

 Now that Alex and Renee are settled in, they’re taking their time furnishing and decorating, but they’re already experiencing the freedom they’d hoped for in retirement.

 “I didn’t want any responsibility, as that defeats the purpose of moving here,” Alex says. “From trips to clubs, there’s so much to do! We’re getting involved at our own pace. You can do as much or as little as you want.”

 For anyone considering a move to Maris Grove, Alex offers this advice: “What are you waiting for, and why aren’t you here already? It’s wonderful. It’s been one pleasant surprise after another here.”

 Thanks to Schechter and the community’s trusted moving professionals, residents like Alex and Renee aren’t just finding a new home–they’re finding peace of mind and a fresh start.
