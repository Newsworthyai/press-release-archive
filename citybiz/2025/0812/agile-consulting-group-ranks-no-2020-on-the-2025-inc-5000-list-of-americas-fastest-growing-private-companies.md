# Agile Consulting Group Ranks No. 2020 on the 2025 Inc. 5000 List of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies

Inc., the leading media brand and playbook for the entrepreneurs and business leaders shaping our future, today announced that Agile Consulting Group is No. 2020 on the annual Inc. 5000 list, the most prestigious ranking of the fastest-growing private companies in America. The list provides a data-driven snapshot of the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Past honorees include companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Chobani, Under Armour, Timberland, Oracle, and Patagonia.

 Aaron Giles, Agile’s Founder and Managing Principal commented on this distinction, saying:“Since founding Agile in 2005 I’ve had my sights set on making the Inc. 5000 list. Making this year’s list is hands down the greatest accomplishment in Agile’s history thus far. There are 33.2 million small businesses in the U.S. For Agile to be ranked No. 2020 out of those means that we’ve strung together a pattern of growth that places Agile in the 99.99th percentile. That seems surreal! I couldn’t be prouder of the team we’ve assembled that has accomplished this.”

 This year’s Inc. 5000 honorees have demonstrated exceptional growth while navigating economic uncertainty, inflationary pressure, and a fluctuating labor market. Among the top 500 companies on the list, the median three-year revenue growth rate reached 1,552 percent, and those companies have collectively added more than 48,678 jobs to the U.S. economy over the past three years.

 “Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” says Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm—they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”

Inc. will celebrate the honorees at the 2025 Inc. 5000 Conference & Gala, taking place October 22–24 in Phoenix, and the top 500 will be listed in the Fall issue of Inc. magazine.

 About Agile Consulting GroupAgile Consulting Group is a sales and use tax consulting firm that assists its clients by aligning their tax and accounting systems with current tax laws to ensure compliance while also maximizing the benefit of the exemptions for which they qualify. Since its founding in 2005, Agile has helped hundreds of clients become and remain compliant with ever-changing sales and use tax laws. There are three segments of Agile’s business all within the niche of sales and use tax – refund recovery reviews, outsourced sales tax compliance services, and audit defense and representation.

 Agile is one of the nation’s leading firms both in terms of dollar volume and quantity of refund claims filed in the refund recovery segment of its business. Agile strives to develop new approaches to, or interpretations of, tax law to maximize sales and use tax exemptions for its clients. Agile has a successful track record of pioneering these new and original ideas and fighting for the states’ acceptance of them.

 Agile’s outsourced sales tax compliance services include nexus studies, taxability determinations, registrations, voluntary disclosure agreements, and ongoing compliance filings. The June 2018 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. caused a significant shift in the responsibilities that companies have in terms of U.S. sales and use tax making it a significant challenge for small and medium sized companies to remain compliant when they previously had little to no responsibilities in this area. Agile’s prior experience, track record, and specialization in sales and use tax helped it be uniquely positioned to assist these companies.

 Agile is currently working to build out the audit defense and representation segment of its business based upon the belief that states will continue to expand their auditing capabilities and efforts. Agile anticipates the trend of increased auditing by states will continue over the coming months and years.
