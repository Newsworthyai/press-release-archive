# Think Consulting Named One of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies by Inc. Magazine for the Fifth Consecutive Year

Think Consulting, a premier consulting firm dedicated to providing exceptional strategic leadership and business solutions, announced today it has been named to the annual Inc. 5000 list, the most prestigious ranking of the fastest growing private companies in America.

 Inc. 5000’s 2025 list provides a data-driven look at the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Past honorees include Microsoft, Meta, Under Armour, Patagonia, and many other name brands.

 “We are honored to once again be named to the Inc. 5000 list of fastest-growing private companies,” said Joe Poling, President and Chief Revenue Officer of Think. “This achievement is a testament to the extraordinary commitment and talent of our Team, who continue to deliver results year after year. After more than two decades of growth, sustaining this level of performance becomes increasingly challenging, making this recognition all the more meaningful. We are grateful, proud, and excited for what lies ahead.”

 Think has been included in the list for the last five years and employs more than 130 consultants and professionals in regions across the country.

 “Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” says Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm—they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”

 In a dynamic economic climate, Think earned a ranking of 4,277 on the list, accelerating its global growth and expanding into strategic service areas. Last year, it announced a partnership with Valtus Alliance, an international network of leading executive interim management companies. With its worldwide reach, the Valtus Alliance partnership is opening opportunities for Think around the globe.

 Think offers management consulting, project management & PMO solutions, post-merger integration, human capital management services, and government solutions to companies in most industries including media, broadcasting, financial services, education, non-profit, manufacturing, and government. Their clients range from small startups, mid-market, to enterprise sized organizations.
