# Trackforce Honored as One of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies by Inc. 5000

Trackforce, a global leader in security workforce management software, today announced it was named one of America’s fastest-growing companies on the annual prestigious Inc. 5000 list. The list offers a data-driven snapshot of the most successful independent, entrepreneurial businesses in the U.S.

 Fueled by rapid adoption of its advanced integrated solutions, Trackforce serves both security firms and corporate security teams across several industries. The company’s technology enables faster response times, strengthens compliance, and elevates performance, helping clients operate more efficiently and protect what matters most.

 “We are honored to be recognized on the Inc. 5000 list for the fourth consecutive year,” said Byron McDuffee, CEO of Trackforce. “Over the past year, we have expanded our reach to serve thousands of security teams in more than 50 countries, strengthening our position as a trusted global partner. This recognition reflects the dedication of our team, the trust of our clients, and the proven impact of our platform in modernizing operations, driving efficiency, and enhancing safety worldwide.”

 In 2025, Trackforce accelerated its platform development to meet the rising demands of a complex security landscape. The company has introduced enhanced capabilities including AI-powered threat detection, connected guard dispatch, remote guarding, and centralized incident resolution. These innovations give security leaders a single, unified view of operations, enabling them to respond faster, bridge the gap between physical and digital security, and make informed real-time decisions that strengthen safety and resilience.

“Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” said Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm—they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”

 Inc. will celebrate the honorees at the 2025 Inc. 5000 Conference & Gala, taking place October 22–24 in Phoenix. For complete results of the Inc. 5000, including company profiles and an interactive database that can be sorted by industry, location, and other criteria, visit www.inc.com/inc5000.
