# ePayPolicy Makes 2025 Inc. 5000 List for 4th Year in a Row

Inc. today announced that ePayPolicy is No. 1759 on the annual Inc. 5000 list, the most well-known ranking of the fastest-growing private companies in America. The list provides a data-driven snapshot of the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Past honorees include companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Chobani, Oracle, and Patagonia.

 This marks ePayPolicy’s fourth consecutive year applying for—and earning—a place on the list. The company also recently surpassed 10,000 active insurance customers on its payments network.

 “We’ve looked forward to the Inc. 5000 awards these last four years because they bring attention to the team’s hard work, and they feel like mile markers for our growth,” said ePayPolicy CEO Mark Engels. “And while we’re proud of what we’ve accomplished so far, we’re even more excited about what we have in front of us.”

 “Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” says Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm—they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”

Built solely for the insurance industry, ePayPolicy serves carriers, MGAs, premium finance companies, and agencies.

Recent feature launches, such as Finance Connect and Network Payables, enhance the connectivity, speed, and security of payments across that network.
