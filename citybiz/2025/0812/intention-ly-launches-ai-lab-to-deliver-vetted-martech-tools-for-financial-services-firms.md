# Intention.ly Launches AI Lab to Deliver Vetted Martech Tools for Financial Services Firms

Intention.ly, the growth engine for financial services companies, announced today the official launch of its AI service line, bringing fully vetted, high-impact AI marketing and sales tools directly to clients.

 Financial services are at a critical impasse with AI: lead the market with proven solutions or watch rivals capture market share with superior efficiency and client engagement.

 “The AI window of opportunity in our space is wide open, but its impact will be most powerful for those who act quickly,” said Kelly Waltrich, CEO of Intention.ly. “Firms that hesitate on AI adoption risk falling permanently behind competitors who are already using these tools to slash operational costs and accelerate client acquisition. We’ve done the heavy lifting by testing dozens of AI platforms, identifying the winners, and creating integrated systems that most firms simply can’t build in-house.”

 Intention.ly specializes in connecting disparate tech and AI platforms into unified systems that amplify each tool’s effectiveness while maintaining cost efficiency, an orchestration that requires technical expertise and deep industry knowledge that few firms possess internally.

 “We’ve cracked the code on making these systems talk to each other in ways that actually multiply their impact,” said Zohray Brennan, Director of Marketing Automation and Operations at Intention.ly. “When you connect the right tools properly, you get exponential results that transform how fast you can scale.”

 In 2023, Intention.ly revolutionized the way financial advisory firms bring their brands to life with Advisor Brand Builder. The industry’s first AI-powered platform marries an innovative, digitally driven workflow with the expertise and oversight of seasoned finserv marketing experts to create beautifully designed, expertly crafted brand visuals and messaging for a fraction of the time and cost. Now, Intention.ly is offering a robust suite of additional AI services, including:

 * Custom GPT Assistants: Secure, branded AI tools trained on your content and resources to support internal teams, sales efforts, and client communications around the clock.
* AI Readiness Audits: A comprehensive service assessing your firm’s preparedness for AI integration, identifying immediate opportunities, and developing a clear roadmap for adopting intelligent marketing solutions before competitors gain an insurmountable advantage.
* AI SEO Audits & Monitoring: As search behavior shifts from keywords to questions, digital visibility now hinges on how well a brand performs across AI-driven platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and beyond. Our AI SEO Audits & Monitoring service helps financial services firms future-proof their digital presence by delivering a clear picture of how, where, and if they appear and rank in generative search ecosystems.
* Go-to-Market Engineering Toolkit: We combine deep technical expertise with AI-powered strategy to design custom workflows and smart automation, turning ambitious growth ideas into scalable, measurable results.
* Intention.Lead: An AI-driven lead growth engine that combines custom content, outbound social media messaging, and targeting logic to expand your audience without manual intervention.

 Intention.ly has also formalized agency partnerships with select AI solutions, giving clients access to powerful platforms at preferred rates. These partnerships enable the delivery of high-performing tools with comprehensive onboarding, customization, and ongoing support, all at lower costs than clients could access independently.

 Attempting to implement AI tools in isolation creates integration, compliance, and operational challenges. Intention.ly eliminates these barriers, serving as both AI lab and strategic filter, deploying only tools that have proven effective across the financial services landscape.
