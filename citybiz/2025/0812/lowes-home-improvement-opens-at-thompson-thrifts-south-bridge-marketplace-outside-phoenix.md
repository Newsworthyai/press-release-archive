# Lowe’s Home Improvement Opens at Thompson Thrift’s South Bridge Marketplace Outside Phoenix

Thompson Thrift, a full-service nationally recognized real estate company, announced today that Lowe’s has opened a 130,000-square-foot store at South Bridge Marketplace in Maricopa. Later this year the company plans to begin construction on a 54,000-square-foot second phase that will be anchored by ALDI.

 “The successful opening of Lowe’s is a testament to the strong partnership we’ve built with the city of Maricopa,” said Dan Sink, president and chief financial officer of Thompson Thrift. “Together, we’re bringing meaningful amenities and services to one of Arizona’s fastest-growing communities, and we look forward to continuing this momentum as South Bridge Marketplace enters its next phase.”

 Located at the northeast corner of John Wayne Parkway and Honeycutt Avenue, South Bridge Marketplace sits within an active growth corridor that sees nearly 70,000 vehicles per day. ALDI has submitted a building permit to the city and Thompson Thrift expects to have the permits necessary for the remaining shop and pad space during the fourth quarter. Einstein Bros. Bagels, Club Pilates, Eurowax and She Nails have signed leases, and Thompson Thrift is negotiating leases for 70% of the remaining space.

 Maricopa, located between Phoenix and Tucson, has experienced remarkable growth over the past two decades. As the population expands, so does the demand for high-quality services and amenities. The city’s pro-business environment and collaborative leadership continue to make it an attractive destination for respected national brands and long-term investment.

 “Maricopa continues to stand out as a high-growth market with strong fundamentals,” said Ashlee Boyd, managing partner for Thompson Thrift Commercial. “We’re seeing robust tenant demand from both national and regional operators, and we expect the remaining space to be fully committed in the near term. Our team is proud to help meet the needs of this dynamic community through thoughtful, long-term development.”

 Since its founding nearly 40 years ago, Thompson Thrift has invested more than $6 billion into local communities and has become known as a trusted partner committed to developing high-quality, attractive multifamily communities and commercial projects across the Midwest, Southeast and Southwest.

 Thompson Thrift remains highly active across Arizona with several notable developments underway. Key projects like Elliot Tech Center in Mesa, Germann Commerce Center in Queen Creek, Pointe17 and Refinery at Pointe17 in Phoenix, The Maddox in Buckeye, Stella in San Tan Valley, South Tempe Square in Tempe, and The Gilmore in Gilbert highlight the company’s continued investment in high-growth markets and its focus on delivering quality developments throughout the state.
