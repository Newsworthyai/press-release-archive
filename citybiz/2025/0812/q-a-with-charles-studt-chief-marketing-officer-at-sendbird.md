# Q&amp;A with Charles Studt, Chief Marketing Officer at Sendbird

Charles Studt is currently the Chief Marketing Officer of Sendbird, an AI agent platform for customer service, and he brings over 20 years of experience in scaling high-growth companies and building technology brands. In his role at Sendbird, Charles is responsible for leading the company’s global marketing strategy and driving the adoption of its agentic AI platform. Before joining Sendbird, Charles held executive marketing roles at Qualtrics, where he led growth for their Customer Experience platform, cementing it as the leading CX solution for global brands.

 What is Sendbird and how does it use AI?

 Sendbird is an AI customer experience platform that many of the world’s leading brands, like DoorDash, Match Group and Yahoo Sports, use to create long-lasting and personalized customer experiences. What sets Sendbird apart is its ability to offer both human-to-human (such as user-to-user chat) and human-to-AI interactions across channels.

 Sendbird’s AI agent is designed to unify and elevate the customer experience by replacing siloed, channel-specific bots and systems with one integrated solution. This allows businesses to deliver consistent and contextual support across every touchpoint, all while improving customer satisfaction and driving greater efficiency and retention.

 What inspired you to join Sendbird?

 In tech, some moments fundamentally shape industries – the PC revolution in the 1980s, the Internet in the 1990s, wireless/3G networks in the 2010s and now AI. Or, more specifically, agentic AI. In the next five years, any software that was once rooted in static or rules-based logic will be replaced by intelligent and adaptive agents. The leaders of this shift are emerging now, and I saw in Sendbird a team with technical maturity and an enterprise-grade platform to deliver on this promise with real business value.

 Equally important, solving customer experience challenges for leading global brands is a mission that I take seriously. I have been building solutions for call centers, contact centers, support and customer experience for over 15 years. There is much more we can do in this area with the intelligent application of AI, not only in more proactively solving customer experience issues, but in elevating customer experience as a driver of top-line business impact.

 To bring it full circle, I love building, and Sendbird offered an opportunity to create a brand and marketing team, as well as help a new generation of marketing leaders develop in their careers.

 What are the key focus areas guiding your leadership at Sendbird?

 There’s no single silver bullet. Building a durable, leading brand in the space starts with a clear and compelling message that reflects the real problems we solve, as well as the value we deliver. Success also requires a cultural shift in how we market, especially with the rise of AI.

 In the AI era, speed, experimentation and iteration outperform slow and deliberate planning. AI tooling and “vibe marketing” help us scale output and personalization, but we can’t lose the human voice in our messages. We need to deeply understand our customers and users, and use our authoritative voice to educate them on the truths and misconceptions around AI solutions.

 What’s your strategic approach to building brand and market share in the agentic AI era?

 I’m not interested in AI for AI’s sake. I’m focused on how technology creates real business value. That’s the core of our strategy: highlighting the tangible outcomes our customers achieve with Sendbird. We’re helping companies transform customer experience from a cost center into a growth driver through AI-powered agents. As a marketer who believes in the power of storytelling, I’m excited to spotlight the real people behind these transformations.
