# Arch Painting Joins 2025 Inc. 5000 List of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies

Arch Painting, the leading provider of nationwide paint contracting services today announced it was ranked No. 3974 on the annual Inc. 5000 list, the most prestigious ranking of the fastest growing private companies in America. The list provides a data-driven snapshot of the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Past honorees, which have gone on to become some of the world’s most recognized brands, include companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Chobani, Under Armour, Timberland, Oracle, and Patagonia.

 “Our dedication to revolutionizing the painting industry through investment in technology and automation puts us in the position of offering a level of customer service that is not found elsewhere in the industry,” said Rich Kilgannon, President & CEO of Arch Painting Inc. “Our growth reflects our employees’ hard work and dedication to customer service, our drive to automate and advance the traditionally blue-collar painting industry and our vision to redefine our customers’ expectations.”

 “Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” said Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm—they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”

 Arch Painting recently announced a reorganization of the company’s divisions to better serve the evolving preferences of its customers. Arch Painting is focused exclusively on commercial customers while Paintzen® is exclusively available to residential customers. Both are backed by the service, breadth and depth of Arch Painting’s 30 years of experience and excellence. Additionally, the company released version 2.0 of its industry leading, pricing and reservation technology platform, now known as Zenify, in early August, to meet the needs of its increasingly tech savvy customer base.

“2025 has been a strong year for Arch Painting. We were named one of the Best Places to Work by Boston Business Journal, included on the Inc. Regionals list of fastest growing companies in the Northeast and now being named by Inc. Magazine to the Inc. 5000 list is an honor,” said Kilgannon.

To qualify, companies must have been founded and generating revenue by March 31, 2021.
