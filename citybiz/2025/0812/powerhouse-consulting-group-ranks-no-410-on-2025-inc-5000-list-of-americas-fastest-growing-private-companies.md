# Powerhouse Consulting Group Ranks No. 410 on 2025 Inc. 5000 List of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies

Inc., the leading media brand and playbook for the entrepreneurs and business leaders shaping our future, today announced that Powerhouse Consulting Group is No. 410 on the annual Inc. 5000 list, the most prestigious ranking of the fastest-growing private companies in America. The list provides a data-driven snapshot of the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Past honorees include companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Chobani, Under Armour, Timberland, Oracle, and Patagonia.

 “Making the Inc. 5000 isn’t just a milestone—it’s validation that what we’re building matters,” said Jenny Benbrook, CEO and co-founder of Powerhouse Consulting Group. “Contractors have been underserved and overwhelmed by tech for too long. Powerhouse is changing that. We’re proud to be recognized as one of America’s fastest-growing companies, but we’re even more proud of the impact we’re having on businesses that keep our communities running.”

 This year’s Inc. 5000 honorees have demonstrated exceptional growth while navigating economic uncertainty, inflationary pressure, and a fluctuating labor market. Among the top 500 companies on the list, the median three-year revenue growth rate reached 1,507 percent, and those companies added more than 52,805 jobs to the U.S. economy over the past three years.

“Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” says Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm—they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”

 Inc. will celebrate the honorees at the 2025 Inc. 5000 Conference & Gala, taking place October 22–24 in Phoenix, and the top 500 will be listed in the Fall issue of Inc. magazine.
