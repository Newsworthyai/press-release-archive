# Crisp Ranks No. 52 on the 2025 Inc. 5000 List of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies, and No. 1 in Arkansas

Inc., the leading media brand and playbook for the entrepreneurs and business leaders shaping our future, today announced that Crisp is No. 52 on the annual Inc. 5000 list, the most prestigious ranking of the fastest-growing private companies in America.

 Crisp was also recognized as the No.1 company in Arkansas and the No. 2 company in Business Products & Services. The list provides a data-driven snapshot of the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Past honorees include companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Chobani, Under Armour, Timberland, Oracle, and Patagonia.

 “This recognition by Inc. is a reflection of our efforts to drive a triple bottom line – good for our customers, good for the environment and good for our business,” said Are Traasdahl, CEO and founder of Crisp. “At a time when agility and innovation are essential, we’re proud to leverage AI to help thousands of brands move faster, reduce waste, and win at the shelf every single day. This milestone fuels our commitment to building a more connected, efficient, and sustainable supply chain.”

 This year’s Inc. 5000 honorees have demonstrated exceptional growth while navigating economic uncertainty, inflationary pressure, and a fluctuating labor market. Among the top 500 companies on the list, the median three-year revenue growth rate reached 1,552 percent, and those companies have collectively added more than 48,678 jobs to the U.S. economy over the past three years.

“Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” says Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm—they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”

 Inc. will celebrate the honorees at the 2025 Inc. 5000 Conference & Gala, taking place October 22–24 in Phoenix, and the top 500 will be listed in the Fall issue of Inc. magazine.

 Methodology

 Companies on the 2025 Inc. 5000 are ranked according to percentage revenue growth from 2021 to 2024. To qualify, companies must have been founded and generating revenue by March 31, 2021. They must be U.S.-based, privately held, for-profit, and independent—not subsidiaries or divisions of other companies—as of December 31, 2024. (Since then, some on the list may have gone public or been acquired.) The minimum revenue required for 2021 is $100,000; the minimum for 2024 is $2 million. As always, Inc. reserves the right to decline applicants for subjective reasons.
