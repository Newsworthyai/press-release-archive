# Q&amp;A with Laura Semlies, Chief Transformation Officer at Get Well

Laura Semlies is the Chief Transformation Officer at Get Well, where she is leading the company’s bold shift to an AI-powered precision care platform. Now part of SAIGroup, Get Well is defining a new lane for the industry, bringing together 25 years of high-tech, high-touch patient engagement with cutting-edge AI to connect and empower patients and providers across every step of their care journeys.

 In this Q&A, Laura discusses how Get Well is deploying AI to directly address primary care and nursing burnout and shares her takeaways from the Get Connected Summit hosted by Get Well recently in Washington, DC.

 At Get Well, we’re using AI to reshape how care gets delivered to bring joy back to practice for today’s doctors and nurses and inspire a new generation of providers to be.

 Let’s start with the big picture: How is Get Well redefining the digital patient experience and leveraging AI to address primary care and nursing burnout?

 These are two big questions. Let’s take them sequentially. First, we’re redefining the digital patient experience by building the industry’s first AI-native precision care platform, one that will connect patients and providers through personalized, intelligent, and actionable support across the continuum of care – from the hospital bed to physician offices, home, and beyond.

 Most digital health solutions pick a lane: they’re either patient-facing apps or clinician tools. We’ve taken a different path. Our core products are designed around the moments that matter most in a patient’s journey, empowering patients with education, guidance, and support while at the same time giving providers tools that synthesize disparate information, reduce noise, and improve care delivery.

 That’s what makes Get Well different. We don’t just engage. We activate patients and drive care continuity beyond the encounter that improves relationships, outcomes, and efficiency to bring some joy back to those who care for patients. And we do it in a way that’s personalized, connected, and scalable.

 Primary care and nursing burnout are complex, systemic challenges. At Get Well, we’re focused on relieving the persistent friction points that drain time, create inefficiencies, and fracture the patient-provider relationship.

 Whether we’re helping a patient understand what to do before surgery, guiding recovery after discharge, or enabling better communication and coordination at the bedside or in the office, our platform is about meeting people where they are – and helping them move forward confidently.

 We empower physicians with a state-of-the-art AI-assistant for primary care providers to augment clinical decision-making, help draft personalized care plans with patient-specific goals and/or needs, and generate initial content for provider review to drive efficiency and outcomes.

 And we’re elevating nursing care at the bedside by automating tasks like education assignment, re-routing non-clinical requests away from nurses to minimize avoidable interruptions that create cognitive load, and powering patient experience rounding to focus on high-impact care and outcomes.

 Our platform helps health systems reclaim time, reduce inefficiencies, and focus human energy where it matters most. As you might expect, that’s good for patients and the providers, too.

 How has that vision evolved since becoming a part of the SAIGroup?

 Our vision has been emboldened and empowered under the leadership of Dr. Romesh Wadhwani – a pioneer of enterprise AI who has invested over $1 billion in building AI-native companies that are redefining complex industries like healthcare. Becoming part of SAIGroup gave Get Well deep AI muscle, accelerating the transformation of our products and enabling us to move at the pace of technology, not the traditional pace of healthcare.

 It also unlocked strategic collaboration with portfolio partners like RhythmX AI, allowing us to bridge the gap between patient engagement and provider workflows in ways never done before. Together, we’re building the first precision care platform that unifies patient experience and hyper-personalized care delivery into a single, intelligent enterprise platform. This enables more targeted, proactive care before, during, after, and between visits.

 We’re not just delivering innovation faster. We’re making it more accessible. Our solutions are designed to roll out quickly, integrate easily, and deliver value without massive capital investments or lengthy implementations. It’s a shift from the pace of healthcare to the pace of technology. That’s only possible because of the rare combination of deep AI capabilities and 25 years of lived healthcare experience. With a legacy of activating over 80 million patients across 100+ health systems, we’re not starting from scratch – we’re transforming from strength.

 Get Well just hosted the Get Connected conference in Washington, DC. What were some of the key takeaways or moments that stood out to you from that event?

 Get Connected was like nothing I’ve ever experienced before – it felt alive! We set out to do something different: not just celebrate where we’ve been, but to invite our clients and partners to co-create where we’re going next. There was a real sense of urgency, creativity, and momentum in every room – we weren’t just talking about the future of care, we were building it together.

 We tackled some of the industry’s hardest questions head-on – through bold executive panels, intimate innovation sessions, and two pre-conference workshops convening Nurse Executives and Population Health Leaders. The conversations were raw, future-focused, and deeply rooted in the realities our partners face every day.

 Two major moments stood out. First, we launched Opal, our on-demand AI patient assistant for hospital experience and post-discharge support. Second was the privilege to introduce RhythmX AI, our sister company and close collaborator, to our extended Get Well Community. RhythmX AI brings an AI-native intelligent assistant platform to primary care providers t enabling them to deliver more personalized care, more efficiently at scale. Together, these are proof points that the Get Well and SAIGroup family are moving fast to unleash the power of GenAI and agentic AI for health systems.

 But the biggest takeaway? Our clients are ready. For the first time in my career, it felt like the conversation wasn’t about if or when technology could change care – it was about how fast we could make it happen together. The urgency, optimism, and willingness to collaborate were palpable.

 Burnout in healthcare is a major systemic issue. What role can AI and other digital tools play in creating a more sustainable workforce? Where does Get Well uniquely fit into that equation?

 Burnout is threatening the sustainability of the workforce for generations to come, eroding the meaning and mission that once made healthcare one of the most purposeful and prestigious professions. The first thing that comes to mind when I think about burnout is the definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. In this context, it’s always about doing more and more without better results. In my mind, the real promise of AI lives in the potential to completely restructure the work so clinical teams can go from “doing more with less” to “doing it differently” with AI-empowerment”.

 Get Well is working at the intersection of the patient and provider relationship to build the next generation of healthcare platforms that have the power to think, learn, and act alongside clinicians and patients with a level of scale, speed, and empathy we could only imagine before. At Get Well, we’re using AI to reshape how care gets delivered to bring joy back to practice for today’s doctors and nurses and inspire a new generation of providers to be.

 How do you balance the use of advanced AI with the need for human-centered care?

 I genuinely believe that advanced AI has the power to reset the balance of technology in healthcare. I choose to see all the possibilities – to expand access, promote and support health, empower patients, and restore the joy back to practice. Some worry that AI will replace people in healthcare and jeopardize human-centered care. I disagree. I think we’re putting space back in the day so that the humans can come back to care, empowered with personalized insights, present for the moments that matter most, and ready to maintain relationships beyond the confines of short visits. This is the kind of precision care we all deserve and will come to expect.

 As a leader driving transformation, what challenges have you encountered when implementing digital solutions across diverse health systems?

 One of the biggest challenges I’ve personally encountered is that clients want to implement technology to drive change and improve results, but at the same time also want to avoid disruption. In the process, they avoid reimagining their workflows and managing change, severely limiting the transformative power of whatever is being implemented. That instinct often leads to incrementalism at best. On the flip side, some organizations get stuck in pilot purgatory, testing tool after tool in isolated pockets without ever moving to scale. It creates the illusion of progress without real impact.

 At Get Well, we design for bite-sized transformation with compounding value. Start small, move fast, measure outcomes, and then scale what works – confidently and intentionally. It’s not about avoiding risk altogether. It’s about managing it wisely so that transformative change is not only possible but certain.

 Looking ahead, what’s your vision for the future of digital patient engagement, and what can we expect next from Get Well?

 The future of digital engagement isn’t about where the patient is or prepping patients for care we already know they need. It’s about how continuously and personally we can support them across time. Our goal isn’t to build better touchpoints. It’s to build precision relationships between patients and their care teams, relationships that are intelligent, adaptive, and enduring in the service of health.

 That means support that starts long before a procedure and continues long after recovery. It means helping people manage chronic conditions, transitions in health, and moments of uncertainty – not episodically, but continuously. And it means giving providers the tools to stay connected to their patients in ways that are scalable, sustainable, and deeply personal.

 We’ve built the foundation – engagement tools that activate patients, empower care teams, and integrate into real workflows. What’s next is continuing to layer in AI, like Opal, to ensure those experiences are proactive, personalized, and always learning.

 That’s the future we’re working toward: continuous, intelligent, human-centered care – delivered everywhere, for everyone.
