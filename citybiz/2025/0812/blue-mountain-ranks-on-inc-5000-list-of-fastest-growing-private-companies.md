# Blue Mountain Ranks on Inc. 5000 List of Fastest Growing Private Companies

Blue Mountain, a premier provider of asset management and compliance software for the life sciences sector, today announced its inclusion on the Inc. 5000 list for 2025. Blue Mountain is among the top 300 software companies to make the Inc. 5000 list. The prestigious ranking provides a data-driven look at the most successful companies in the private sector. Past honorees include companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Chobani, Under Armour, Timberland, Oracle, and Patagonia.

 “This achievement reflects our team’s dedication, passion, and relentless focus on transforming enterprise asset management in life sciences,” said David Rode, CEO of Blue Mountain. “Our growth is driven by the trust our customers place in us to deliver innovative, compliant, and purpose-built solutions that support GMP operations across the industry. We are proud to be recognized by Inc. Magazine as one of America’s fastest-growing private companies in 2025. Looking ahead, we’re excited to capitalize on our next wave of growth fueled by transformative trends like Industry 4.0 and artificial intelligence—unlocking new levels of efficiency, compliance, and insight for our customers.”

 This year’s Inc. 5000 honorees have demonstrated exceptional growth while navigating economic uncertainty, inflationary pressure, and a fluctuating labor market. Among the top 500 companies on the list, the median three-year revenue growth rate reached 1,552 percent, and those companies have collectively added more than 48,678 jobs to the U.S. economy over the past three years.

“Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” says Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm—they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”

 Inc. will celebrate the honorees at the 2025 Inc. 5000 Conference & Gala, taking place October 22–24 in Phoenix, and the top 500 will be listed in the Fall issue of Inc. magazine.
