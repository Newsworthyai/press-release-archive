 You began your journey at Ankrom Moisan as an intern and have now grown into the role of President and CEO. As you step into this new chapter, what are your main priorities for the firm? How do you envision positioning it to remain “future-ready”?

 I am deeply honored to step into the role of President and CEO after 25 years of growing alongside Ankrom Moisan. This firm has been a place of opportunity, learning, and purpose for me, and my top priority is to ensure that same experience for the next generation. As we look ahead, my focus is on building a resilient, future-ready firm by embracing change with curiosity, designing with intention, and staying grounded in our values.

 To remain future-ready, we’re doubling down on what we do best—designing vibrant, livable communities with excellence in all types of housing (market rate, affordable, senior, and student housing), sustainability, and mass timber, while also leaning into new possibilities. We’re exploring how emerging technologies like AI can enhance creativity and efficiency in our design process, and how we can expand our services and presence in markets where our multidisciplinary approach creates distinct value.

 Most importantly, the foundation of Ankrom Moisan has always been our collaborative culture. For me, that means continuing to foster mentorship, supporting professional growth, and making sure every voice has a place in shaping our future. I believe our culture, rooted in integrity, creativity, and shared ownership through our ESOP, is what allows us to adapt and thrive, no matter the challenge.

What is your approach to leadership development and mentorship at the firm, especially with young professionals entering the industry during a time of significant economic, technological, and cultural shifts?

 We believe that investing in our team is the most important thing we can do to secure our future. Our people-first culture defines how we lead, mentor, and grow. Leadership development at our firm is rooted in trust, empowerment, and a shared sense of ownership. We provide people with opportunities to lead early and often, offering them support and guidance along the way.

 Today’s emerging professionals are entering an industry undergoing profound transformation—economic uncertainty, rapid technological change, and cultural shifts that are redefining how we work and live. One of the clearest examples of this is the evolution of the hybrid workplace. We’ve had to rethink how mentorship, collaboration, and creativity happen across screens and offices. That challenge has pushed us to be more intentional in how we connect, develop talent, and sustain our culture—even when we’re not all in the same room. We’re committed to testing, listening, and adapting to find what works best for our people and our teams.

 Rather than resist these shifts, we lean into them. We actively create space for continuous learning, experimentation, and curiosity. Whether it’s adapting to new work models, embracing AI and emerging design technologies, or navigating the increasing complexity of projects and client expectations, we want our teams to feel both challenged and supported.

 A key pillar of this philosophy is our ESOP structure. Because every employee is an owner, leadership development isn’t confined to title or tenure. The focus is on growing a mindset of accountability and stewardship across the firm. Our goal is to develop leaders who not only guide projects but also shape the future of our practice and our communities.

What are some of the most urgent challenges and opportunities facing our cities, especially on the West Coast, today, and how can design help address them? How does this shape Ankrom Moisan’s approach to urban and mixed-use projects?

 Throughout my tenure at Ankrom Moisan, I’ve seen the fabric of our cities evolve dramatically—and today, the West Coast is a critical inflection point. The housing crisis is the most urgent challenge we face. Demand for all types of housing, from affordable to workforce and market-rate, continues to outpace supply, putting immense pressure on individuals, families, and communities. At the same time, rising development costs and high interest rates have made it incredibly difficult for housing projects to pencil out, even when the will to build is there.

 While we can’t control macroeconomic forces like interest rates, we can, and must, advocate for entitlement and permitting processes that are more efficient, transparent, and reasonable. These barriers add cost, delay, and unpredictability to projects that communities desperately need. We also have a responsibility as designers to find creative ways to make buildings more efficient without compromising livability or dignity. That means embracing clean, simple, purposeful architecture that reduces construction costs while still delivering lasting value.

 One of the myths we must continue to dismantle is that lower cost equals lower quality design. Good design is not about expensive materials or unnecessary complexity—it’s about investing construction dollars where they matter most: in the elements that serve people, enhance community life, and stand the test of time.

Beyond meeting regulatory requirements, how can architects and designers push boundaries to drive meaningful environmental innovation? Where do you see the biggest gaps the industry still needs to address?

 Sustainability extends beyond compliance or checking boxes. At its core, good design is sustainable design. And truly sustainable design doesn’t just focus on regulatory requirements like energy efficiency, it centers on the health, wellness, and long-term experience of the people who use our buildings.

 This human-centered approach is more important than ever. While recent policy changes have rolled back many of the incentive programs that once supported innovation, the absence of external motivators makes it even more critical for architects and designers to lead. We have a responsibility to help our clients find value in sustainability through reduced operating costs, improved occupant health, and buildings that remain adaptable and resilient over time.

 We also need to broaden how we talk about sustainability. Instead of solely focusing on energy use or carbon, we need to emphasize its impact on creating buildings that promote wellbeing, connect people to nature, and strengthen communities. That means designing for daylight, fresh air, thermal comfort, and material health. It means being thoughtful about longevity, maintenance, and how a building can evolve to meet future needs.

 Even in a more challenging policy landscape, sustainable outcomes are still achievable when driven by design intent, technical rigor, and a deep understanding of what truly adds value for people and place.

 Over the next five years, we’re going to see major shifts in how architecture and design are practiced. AI will be one of the biggest drivers of that change. It won’t replace architects, but it will change how we work. Used thoughtfully, AI has the potential to enhance design exploration, streamline documentation, and improve decision-making by helping quickly test options, analyze performance, and visualize outcomes earlier in the process. The firms that treat it as a partner, not a gimmick, will be the ones who thrive.

 But technology isn’t the only force reshaping our industry. The pressures around housing affordability, climate adaptation, and demographic shifts are just as influential. We’re designing for an increasingly diverse population, across a wider range of needs, from aging in place to hybrid work to mental wellness. Our cities are at a tipping point, and the future of urban design will require rethinking density, mobility, and the reuse of existing spaces in smarter, more adaptive ways.

 As someone who rose through the ranks from intern to President and CEO, what advice would you give to emerging architects and designers hoping to make an impact in shaping the future of the built environment?

 Stay curious and commit to being a lifelong learner. Change is coming at us faster than ever—technologically, culturally, and environmentally—and the best way to stay relevant and resilient is to lean into it. Try different things. Stretch yourself. And don’t be afraid to fail, especially on a small scale. Failure is often where the most growth happens.

 When I started as an intern, I thought the way I would make an impact was through the buildings I designed. That was my initial “why.” But over time, as I took on new roles and worked with larger teams, I realized my impact could grow by empowering others, by helping them create better places for the future. Your purpose may evolve, and that’s okay. What matters is being open to the idea that how you lead and contribute will shift as your perspective grows.

 Architecture is a long game. Be patient, stay curious, and keep adapting.
