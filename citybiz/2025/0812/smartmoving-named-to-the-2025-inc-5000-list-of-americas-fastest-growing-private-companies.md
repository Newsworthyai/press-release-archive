# SmartMoving Named to the 2025 Inc. 5000 List of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies

DALLAS–(BUSINESS WIRE)–SmartMoving, the leading profitability platform for moving companies, has been named to the 2025 Inc. 5000, Inc. Magazine’s annual list of the fastest-growing private companies in America. This honor reflects the growing momentum behind SmartMoving’s mission to help movers build more profitable businesses and better lives.

 “Most moving company owners are stuck working 60+ hour weeks just to keep the lights on,” said Tobe Thompson, CEO of SmartMoving. “We built SmartMoving to flip that script. Our customers are proving every day that you don’t have to grind forever to grow.”

 SmartMoving turns disjointed operations into organized, profitable systems. The platform connects sales, dispatch, crews, storage, billing, and payments in one simple interface built for movers. From missed leads to margin leaks, SmartMoving helps moving companies stop firefighting and start scaling.

 Thousands of movers across North America have used SmartMoving to eliminate paperwork, boost close rates, and grow profitably without working seven days a week.

 “This recognition isn’t just about our growth. It’s about what our customers are building with us. More efficient businesses. More time with family. More weekends off. That’s the real win,” Thompson said.
