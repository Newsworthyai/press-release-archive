# New Seabrook Residents Enjoy Expert, Personalized Help and Support

By Linda Esterson

 Drawn to the vibrant, worry-free lifestyle and abundance of amenities at Seabrook, an Erickson Senior Living community in Tinton Falls, N.J., Margaret and Seth Behar decided to join the Priority List.

 As Priority List members, the Behars enjoyed a range of valuable perks, but access to personalized planning and moving support was the most impactful one by far.

 “We knew we needed to downsize before we could even think about selling,” Margaret recalls. “We expected it would take a year to go through everything, but with the help of the Seabrook team, the process turned out to be easier and much faster than we imagined.”

 “We’re here to support incoming residents in every way we can,” explains Lauren Schieda, sales counselor at Seabrook. “It’s not just about the physical move; it’s about being prepared and comfortable throughout the entire process.”

 A great help

 First, a Seabrook sales team member paid a complimentary visit to the Behars in their townhouse in Freehold, N.J.

 They provided a detailed checklist of all the steps the couple could take to prepare for their move and conducted a walk-through of their townhouse, room by room, to help them determine what furniture they wanted to bring with them.

 “We’ve found it’s really helpful to use a schematic diagram of the chosen floor plan to show incoming residents how their belongings will look in the layout,” Schieda explains.

 The Behars selected a two-bedroom, two-bath floor plan with an open-concept living and dining room area as well as a balcony–a priority for them.

 Perfectly prepared

 Knowing that the Behars were interested in additional support with downsizing and selling, the Seabrook sales team then provided the couple with a list of preferred vendors, including real estate agents, move coordinators, and moving companies.

 Every company and service has been vetted by the community and boasts a track record of top-notch customer service.

 “They’re experts that we trust,” Schieda says. “Our network of preferred real estate agents helps expedite the process because they’re proven to be the best agents in the area. They keep us updated in real time–it takes pressure off of our future residents too.”

 The real estate agent Margaret and Seth chose also happened to be a move coordinator, which made the process even more seamless.

 “She was unbelievably helpful throughout the entire process,” says Seth. “She had the answers we needed and connections for packing, donating, and making minor repairs. She even brought us boxes and tape and took bags to the donation center.”

 Thanks to all the collaborative preparation, the Behars’ townhouse was packed and staged in a timely manner. Once listed, it sold in a week!

 The moving and unpacking process was just as seamless.

 “Everyone was super helpful, nice, and available via phone call or text,” Margaret notes. “As challenging as moving can be, they made it just so much easier.”

 A new lifestyle

 Since settling into their residence, Margaret and Seth have enjoyed meeting up with neighbors and new friends at Seabrook’s five restaurants–one of their favorite aspects of community life.

 “The food is excellent,” Seth says. “We’ve enjoyed every meal here.”

 In fact, the Behars even volunteer for a group that meets with leadership to share thoughts on the restaurants’ experience and menu options.

 Seth is a regular at the fitness center and in exercise classes, and Margaret spends time knitting and crocheting with a group in the creative arts studio. She also frequents the salon in the community.

 Together, they spend time in the Seabrook library, attend movies in the auditorium, concerts, on the Great Lawn outdoors, and visit the lounge area outside of the Fireside restaurant, where they read and play backgammon.

 “I know they call it independent living, but it’s really active living!” Seth says. And thanks to the help and support from their team of moving experts, Margaret and Seth were able to begin enjoying their new vibrant, active lifestyle from day one.
