# Tenovi Ranks No. 55 on the 2025 Inc. 5000 List of Fastest-Growing Private Companies in America

Tenovi, a leading provider of full-stack remote monitoring solutions, has earned the No. 55 spot on Inc. Magazine’s 2025 Inc. 5000 list, ranking the fastest-growing private companies in the U.S. The company also achieved No. 1 in New Hampshire, No. 2 in the Boston metro area, and No. 11 nationally in healthcare, reflecting exceptional growth and impact in the digital health sector.

 From 2021 to 2024, Tenovi’s revenue surged 4,890%, powered by its rapidly expanding national footprint. As of August 2025, the company has shipped 268,000 devices and served a quarter million patients.

 “Too many patients wait months between visits and those delays create dangerous gaps in care,” said Nizan Friedman, Ph.D., Co-Founder and CEO of Tenovi. “Our mission is to close those gaps by simplifying remote care with connected devices that put patients first. By combining clinical integrity, seamless integration, and secure, real-time data, we give care teams the tools to deliver proactive, measurable outcomes. This is just the beginning.”

 “Our primary goal is to simplify remote care by providing tools that ‘just work’ for the people that matter most: patients and their clinical care teams,” said Daniel Zondervan, Ph.D., Co-Founder and CTO of Tenovi. “Landing at number 55 on the Inc. 5000 list reinforces our belief in that approach. We’re on the right path, and we’re just getting started.”

 Tenovi’s growth reflects rising demand for device-agnostic, EHR-integrated remote monitoring platforms that work across every care environment. Today, Tenovi supports 180+ partners, 40+ FDA-cleared devices, and care teams in all 50 states, spanning health systems, community health centers, RPM companies, health plans, pharmacies, and digital health innovators.

At the core of Tenovi’s infrastructure-first model is the Tenovi Gateway, which removes connectivity barriers by enabling plug-and-play remote monitoring: no apps, no Wi-Fi, and no syncing required. Clinicians can scale RPM and RTM programs across any patient population with real-time access to actionable data. This solution-centered approach is supported by world-class fulfillment, patient engagement, and clinical support, all central to Tenovi’s mission of improving lives by simplifying remote care.
