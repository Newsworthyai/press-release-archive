# TradeCentric Named to Inc. 5000 List of Fastest-Growing Private Companies for Fourth Year in a Row

TradeCentric, the leading provider of B2B Connected Commerce solutions powering integration and automation between eCommerce and eProcurement systems, has been recognized for the fourth consecutive year as one of America’s fastest-growing private companies on Inc.‘s annual Inc. 5000 list.

 The Inc. 5000 class of 2025 represents companies that have driven rapid revenue growth while navigating inflationary pressure, the rising costs of capital, and seemingly intractable hiring challenges. Among this year’s top 5000 companies, the average median three-year revenue growth rate is 1,637 percent. In all, this year’s Inc. 5000 companies have added 874,458 jobs to the economy over the past three years.

 “Earning a spot on the Inc. 5000 list for the fourth year in a row is a testament to our team’s commitment to delivering meaningful value to customers around the world,” said Elizabeth Segovia, CEO of TradeCentric. “We’re proud to power B2B Connected Commerce at scale, helping enterprise buyers and suppliers work better together through automation, insights, and a global-first approach.”

 Inclusion in the Inc. 5000 list, along with being named one of Inc.’s Best Workplaces, marks another major milestone in a year of momentum for TradeCentric. The company continues to drive forward with key investments and strategic growth:

 * Enhancing product innovation with new upcoming analytics capabilities designed to deliver deeper business impact insights.
* Advancing AI initiatives to streamline system configuration, enable intelligent self-service, and power proactive issue detection.
* Expanding the buyer network to help procurement teams connect with strategic suppliers and streamline purchasing.
* Strengthening global presence with a growing team in Bucharest, Romania, to support customers across EMEA.
* Deepening partnerships with leading platforms, including Coupa, Salesforce, Shopify, and BigCommerce.

 “One of the greatest joys of my job is going through the Inc. 5000 list,” says Mike Hofman, who recently joined Inc. as editor-in-chief. “To see all of the intriguing and surprising ways that companies are transforming sectors, from health care and AI to apparel and pet food, is fascinating for me as a journalist and storyteller. Congratulations to this year’s honorees, as well, for growing their businesses fast despite the economic disruption we all faced over the past three years, from supply chain woes to inflation to changes in the workforce.”

 MethodologyCompanies on the 2024 Inc. 5000 are ranked according to percentage revenue growth from 2020 to 2023. To qualify, companies must have been founded and generating revenue by March 31, 2020. They must be U.S.-based, privately held, for-profit, and independent—not subsidiaries or divisions of other companies—as of December 31, 2023. (Since then, some on the list may have gone public or been acquired.) The minimum revenue required for 2020 is $100,000; the minimum for 2023 is $2 million. As always, Inc. reserves the right to decline applicants for subjective reasons. Growth rates used to determine company rankings were calculated to four decimal places.
