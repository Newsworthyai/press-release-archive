 With a focus on being a sustainable shopping resource for local families, the new Once Upon A Child in Missoula opens on Aug. 14, 2025. Once Upon A Child is part of Winmark – the Resale Company®, a unique national retail resale franchise that focuses on sustainability, small business formation and providing Resale for Everyone®.

 Meet the Local Owner

 Local entrepreneur Desiree Dillavou knows firsthand the value of affordable, high-quality children’s clothing and accessories. While raising her three daughters in Rapid City, South Dakota, she was a regular customer at her local Once Upon a Child—a store that quickly became an essential part of her parenting journey.

 After relocating to Missoula seven years ago, Dillavou found herself working in the corporate world, however owning a business that gives back to the community was always her dream. Motivated by her passion for sustainable shopping, she turned to the business that supported her while raising her three children to bring that vision to life. Opening Once Upon A Child presented an opportunity to bring a convenient and affordable business that aims to help Missoula families.

 “We’re excited to bring Once Upon a Child to Missoula and expand the business’ footprint in Montana,” says Dillavou. “I’m incredibly thrilled to be doing this alongside my family, with each of my girls playing a role in the business. Getting to do this as a family has been rewarding, and we are looking forward to sharing it with the community.”

 More about Once Upon A Child Missoula

 Once Upon A Child’s unique retail resale concept allows for clothing, toys and accessories for kids to end up in someone else’s house rather than thrown into a landfill, providing a resource for new or existing parents who are looking to update their children’s closet on a budget and in a mindful environmental manner.

 Unlike a typical consignment store, Once Upon A Child does not require appointments and pays on the spot for items it purchases from consumers. At Once Upon A Child families are able to buy necessities for their children at great values and turn their gently used items into cash.

 In addition, Once Upon A Child ensures that all products purchased and sold meet mandatory and voluntary safety standards. Staff members stay up-to-date on current recalled items, immediately pulling all recalled products from shelves and making sure all items purchased are safety-checked to meet current standards.

 For questions on the buying process or store hours, the new Once Upon A Child can be reached at 406-317-1859 or https://onceuponachild.com/locations/missoula-mt/.
