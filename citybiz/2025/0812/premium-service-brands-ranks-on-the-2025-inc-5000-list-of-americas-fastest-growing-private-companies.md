# Premium Service Brands Ranks on the 2025 Inc. 5000 List of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies

Premium Service Brands (PSB), a leading franchisor of home services concepts across North America, has ranked No. 3,632 on the 2025 Inc. 5000, the most prestigious list of the fastest-growing private companies in the U.S. This marks PSB’s second consecutive appearance on the list and reflects the company’s continued growth, innovation, and leadership in franchising.

 “This recognition is a reflection of our incredible franchisees, dedicated team, and the powerful systems we’ve built together,” said Paul Flick, CEO and Founder of Premium Service Brands. “We’ve seen consistent growth not just because of the services we offer, but because of the people behind them. Our mission to support entrepreneurs, serve communities, and deliver best-in-class home services continues to push us forward.”

 PSB’s rise in the rankings follows a record-breaking 119-unit opening and expansion growth in 2024. The brand also boasts a standout first half of 2025, during which the company signed nearly 60 new franchise agreements, expanded its corporate team, and introduced Infinity Lights, a new service offering that enhances the homeowner experience across PSB’s multi-brand network.

 This year’s Inc. 5000 honorees have demonstrated remarkable resilience and adaptability, growing through inflationary challenges, labor market shifts, and evolving consumer expectations. Among the top 500 companies on the list, the median three-year revenue growth rate reached 1,552 percent, and all honorees collectively added more than 48,678 jobs to the U.S. economy over the past three years.

 With over 400 franchise locations across the U.S., PSB operates nine distinct brands including 360° Painting, ProLift Garage Doors, House Doctors, The Grout Medic, Kitchen Wise | Closet Wise, Maid Right, Window Gang, Rubbish Works, and RooterMan, each focused on delivering reliable, high-quality home services backed by strong franchisee support.
