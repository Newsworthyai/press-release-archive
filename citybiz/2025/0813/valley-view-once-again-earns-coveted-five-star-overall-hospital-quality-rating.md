# Valley View Once Again Earns Coveted Five-Star Overall Hospital Quality Rating

Valley View, an independent, not-for-profit health system based in Glenwood Springs, is proud to announce that it has once again received a coveted Five-Star Rating for Overall Hospital Quality from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).

 The 2025 ratings for hospitals nationwide are based on their performance across 45 hospital quality measures, which are divided into five quality categories including safety of care, mortality, patient experience, readmission rates and timely and effective care. Valley View is one of only 12 hospitals in Colorado and 290 nationwide to receive this prestigious designation, the top rating possible, which would not be possible without Valley View’s phenomenal employees.

 To commemorate the dedication of its hardworking team, Valley View will host a special celebration for its employees, where they will enjoy a barbecue meal.

 “We are honored and proud to receive this national recognition as a five-star overall quality-rated hospital from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the second consecutive year,” said Brian Murphy, MD, CEO of Valley View. “Achieving this distinction once is an honor, but earning it again is a true testament to the consistent dedication and excellence of our physicians, nurses, administrators, and support staff. CMS rates nearly 3,000 hospitals nationwide, and this continued recognition affirms the exceptional care we deliver to our patients every day. I commend our entire team for their commitment to making Valley View a leader in health care for our region.”

 Valley View offers a patient-centric approach to health care, which is guided by values such as safety, quality and service to the community. Valley View is committed to keeping care local as the region’s independent health care leader.

 Patients, families and communities can view the star ratings for acute care hospitals on the Care Compare website.
