# Valor Ranks on the 2025 Inc. 5000 list

Valor, a Fort Worth-based tech-enabled professional services company providing oil and gas asset management and specializing in mineral management and back-office solutions, has been named to the 2025 Inc. 5000 list, the most prestigious ranking of the fastest-growing private companies in America. The list provides a data-driven snapshot of the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Past honorees include companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Chobani, Under Armour, Timberland, Oracle, and Patagonia.

 “We are honored to be named to the 2025 Inc. 5000 list for the third consecutive year. This continued recognition is a testament to our team’s dedication, innovation, and the exceptional service we provide to our clients and community. I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built at Valor and excited for the growth and success still ahead,” said Joseph DeWoody, CEO and Co-founder of Valor.

 This year’s Inc. 5000 honorees have demonstrated exceptional growth while navigating economic uncertainty, inflationary pressure, and a fluctuating labor market. Among the top 500 companies on the list, the median three-year revenue growth rate reached 1,552 percent, and those companies collectively added more than 48,678 jobs to the U.S. economy over the past three years.

“Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” says Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm—they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”
