 The South Florida Business Unit of DPR Construction has completed the exterior, including the roof and weatherproofing, of the new 25,000-square-foot Holy Cross Health Free-Standing Emergency Department (FSED) in Deerfield Beach, located at 340 S Federal Highway. Interior construction work began on August 11.

 Holy Cross leased the former Orchard Supply Hardware location with plans to complete cosmetic upgrades. According to Bala Purushothaman, DPR’s project manager, a number of structural issues in the existing building were discovered in the early stages of renovation, resulting in a complete demolition of the building except for a few steel columns and beams.

 “As we started demolishing the interiors of the existing building, we discovered tie beam issues, no rebar in the exterior walls and other issues that forced us to demolish the entire building except for a few steel beams,” he explained. “But we are tracking great per our current schedule and are on schedule for the planned opening in the spring of next year.”

 The ability to handle all of the unexpected aspects of the project, added Purushothaman, rests with the quality work of the more than 30 trade partners. “The entire team has enabled us to maintain the schedule, manage the budget and earn an excellent safety record,” he said.

On-site features will include a fully functional on-site laboratory, private treatment and exam rooms, as well as a dedicated ambulance bay for fast and efficient emergency response.

 According to Taren O’Brien, MSN, R.N., Holy Cross Health Chief Nursing Officer, “The FSED seeks to reduce patient wait times and will be open 24/7, making emergency services convenient and accessible to residents of Deerfield Beach and the surrounding areas.”

 Known for its proven experience over the past two decades constructing healthcare facilities in South Florida, DPR also is building two addition FSEDs for Memorial Healthcare Systems in Pembroke Pines and Miramar.
