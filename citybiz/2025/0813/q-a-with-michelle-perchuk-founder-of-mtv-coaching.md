# Q&amp;A with Michelle Perchuk, Founder of MTV Coaching

Michelle Perchuk is a career strategist, former executive recruiter, Forbes Council member and founder of MTV Coaching, a career coaching service that helps individuals discover, design, and realize their career goals.

 MTV Coaching is not your average coaching service. It’s a results-driven, high-touch practice designed for high-performing professionals, especially those in the tech and finance fields who are at a career crossroads and know they’re meant for more. Whether it’s a full pivot, a strategic promotion, or finally getting unstuck, Michelle helps clients stop settling and start designing careers they actually love.

 A former Talent Acquisition Executive with more than two decades of experience recruiting for Wall Street and Silicon Valley, Michelle knows how companies hire from the inside out, giving her clients a powerful advantage. “It’s like insider trading for your career,” she often says. Her strategies are bold, direct, and proven. Many of MTV Coaching’s clients land roles within just 14 days, often with 20%+ increases in compensation.

 Michelle has built MTV Coaching into a deeply personalized service that blends strategy, accountability, and clarity. She’s been called the “Fairy Godmother Who Makes Career Dreams Come True”, and for good reason: she sees her clients’ potential before they fully do, helping them bring it to life with precision and purpose.

 She’s also been featured by NASDAQ, is a published author, and continues to lead the coaching conversation through platforms like LinkedIn and Instagram, where much of her community finds her. MTV Coaching’s success lies in strategy, market insights, and redefining what job-seeking can be. “A résumé is just a piece of paper without a strategy,” Michelle notes.

 You’ve been described as the “Fairy Godmother Who Makes Career Dreams Come True.” How did that nickname come about, and how do you live up to it with your clients?

 The nickname came about when clients started saying that they got career opportunities they never imagined and that I had the magic touch. The ability to recognize their full potential very often the potential they don’t see themselves. I live up to that everyday because I dig deep and really understand my clients skills and ability to solve problems in the world. I map their past experience to a new and exciting career opportunity and give them a system they can follow in order to land their dream job.

 Many professionals struggle to pivot into a new industry or role. What’s the first step someone should take if they know they’re “meant for more” but feel stuck?

 They should evaluate their transferable skills and do research if the new industry needs people with this skill set. Then they should ask themselves, why would a new industry need me, what can I bring to the table? Most people have a really tough time doing this and many invest in a coach to help them figure this out.

 You say MTV Coaching is “like insider trading for your career.” Can you share an example of how your insider knowledge from Wall Street and Silicon Valley has helped a client land their dream job?

 When I say insider trading, I mean that it’s information that no one has access to and will give someone a competitive edge. Regarding Wall Street and Silicon Valley I have recruited for some of the biggest logos in those locations and many of my clients have evolved and obtained really senior leadership roles by this point. Insider Trading for Jobseekers means they get access to jobs that no one else has access to, we like to call it the hidden job market.

 Your clients often see results in just 14 days, sometimes with 20%+ compensation increases. What are the key factors that make those fast, high-impact results possible?

 The key factor is changing your mindset from hunting for jobs to hunting for problems. If you are in front of a decision maker who is convinced you can solve their problem they will hire you in a minute. That is why we have seen our clients get jobs in such a short period of time. Additionally we have a proprietary system when it comes to networking, and our clients start that right away and uncover job opportunities that need to be filled right away.

 You work primarily with high-performing professionals in tech and finance. What unique challenges do people in these industries face when it comes to career transitions?

 There is a lot of competition and people struggle to get through the gatekeepers in Human Resources. High performing professionals usually never had to look for a job before and now they are lost on how to find one in a digital world. They keep applying online, getting rejections and automated responses. This is a complete waste of time but unfortunately people just dont know about an alternative.

 “A résumé is just a piece of paper without a strategy” is one of your signature lines. What are the most common résumé mistakes you see—and how do you help clients fix them?

 People are hung up on resumes being short and to the point. When you cut out important information from a resume a hiring manager will not be interested in interviewing you because they simply don’t see what you have to offer. The resumes we do at MTV Coaching are very unique, we reverse engineer and curate the information on a resume based on your dream job description. And we give you a strategy that will drive more recognition for expertise.

 As a former executive recruiter, how has your perspective on the hiring process changed since moving into career coaching?

 My perspective has not changed, it actually has evolved. I have watched for years roles and career opportunities created for people who proved they could solve business problems. I have been in conference rooms when there was a resignation and a Managing Director would ask the entire team for referrals. And I rescued exhausted hiring managers who would look for candidates on Linkedin on their own time because recruiting and HR would not give them the right candidates. So I am convinced that job boards and online applications rarely work, if you get in front of a decision maker you will get hired.

 You blend strategy, accountability, and clarity into your coaching process. Can you walk us through what that looks like from a client’s first session to landing their new role?

 When I work with a new client we take time to understand what they want for their professional life. We define their vision and the impact they want to create. If they just want a job then this is really not going to work. Once a professional knows what they want and why it’s important to them we give them a proven system strategy that has worked for hundreds of people. But that’s not enough, accountability is extremely important. This is the reason why when you become a client we offer so much support, individual and group.

 We hold weekly meetings to give our clients a sense of community with other students and provide them the ability to network with each other. We also provide individual coaching sessions where a client may feel comfortable to discuss more sensitive topics. Lastly, we have a Learning Portal which was designed to reinforce all the concepts with worksheets and exercises. It has been a game changer because a client can review the lessons they need before an interview or diving into networking. They have all the knowledge at their fingertips.

 You’ve been featured on NASDAQ and are a Forbes Council member. How have these platforms helped you expand your reach and impact in the career coaching space?

 When I was asked to write for Forbes it has helped me share my expertise with the international crowd and it has enabled me to work with people in other industries as well. For example: my clients have always been in Finance and Technology but with the help of Forbes I now work with executives in Pharmaceuticals and Marketing.

 Additionally, since I became a Forbes Council member I have been able to expand my audience to Europe and the Middle East. As a matter of fact I was just featured on a Digital cover for Forbes Arabia. Being featured on NASDAQ has helped me get the recognition from the Finance forms in New York. Traditionally, this industry is always very selective who they work with and it was important for them to see my business reach this milestone so they can finally trust me and consider me an insider.

 For someone reading this who feels they’ve been settling in their career, what’s one piece of advice you’d want them to take away from your work at MTV Coaching?

 Everything is about mindset, if you believe you can land your dream role and you are willing to leave your comfort zone to do so, we are here to help. Growth only comes when you get uncomfortable, if you want to achieve more and are ready to work we have a bulletproof system that will get you there.
