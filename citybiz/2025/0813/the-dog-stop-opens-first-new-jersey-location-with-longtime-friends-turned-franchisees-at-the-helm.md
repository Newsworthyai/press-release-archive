# The Dog Stop Opens First New Jersey Location with Longtime Friends-Turned-Franchisees at the Helm

The Dog Stop, the all-inclusive and award-winning dog care brand, is officially making its New Jersey debut. Set to open in late August, the new Long Hill location at 977 Valley Rd, Gillette, NJ 07933, marks the brand’s first location in the state. A grand opening celebration is scheduled for Saturday, September 27, featuring a ribbon cutting ceremony with the local Chamber of Commerce, food trucks, and plenty of treats for four-legged guests.

 The Long Hill location is led by local owners Rob Lax and David Weinberg, longtime friends turned business partners. Rob is a certified dog trainer with more than 25 years of experience raising and training guide dogs for the blind through The Seeing Eye in Morristown, the world’s oldest existing guide dog school. His deep expertise in canine behavior and lifelong passion for dogs have shaped his professional path from an early age.

 David, a passionate dog owner, brings a complementary background as an attorney with a career in media and sports law, spanning roles with the World Cup Organizing Committee, Major League Soccer, and the NFL. After years in corporate and legal environments, he was ready to take ownership of a business rooted in purpose and found that in The Dog Stop.

 “Dogs have been at the center of my life since I was a kid. I’ve trained dozens of Seeing Eye dogs and built my career around helping people through my connection with animals,” said Lax. “David and I come from different industries, but we both care deeply about dogs, service, and building something that gives back to our community. That’s what made The Dog Stop such a natural fit for us.”

 Spanning 10,000 square feet (8,000 indoors and 2,000 outdoors), The Dog Stop in Long Hill will offer the brand’s full suite of services: luxury boarding accommodations, an interactive and social daycare experience, expert training, spa-like grooming, holistic retail, and more. The team plans to grow to at least three locations in the region and is committed to supporting the local community, including sponsorship of the Long Hill Education Foundation.

 “Rob and David are exactly the kind of passionate, community-focused owners we look for,” said Jesse Coslov, CEO and Co-Founder of The Dog Stop. “Their combined expertise brings something truly special to our brand. We’re proud to have them lead the way as we expand into New Jersey and introduce more pet parents to the high-quality care The Dog Stop is known for.”

 Owned and operated by dog people since 2009, The Dog Stop franchise has built a reputation as a leader in comprehensive pet care, with expert staff trained in dog behavior, grooming, and nutrition. Every product in its retail section is carefully selected to ensure quality, and every service is tailored to meet the unique needs of each dog.
