Sponsorship marks credit union’s second affiliation with a local pro sports team

 Tropical Financial Credit Union (TFCU), a not-for-profit financial institution based in Broward County, is kicking off a new partnership with Fort Lauderdale United FC (FTL UTD), the trailblazing South Florida-based professional women’s soccer team that wrapped up its electrifying inaugural season in June 2025. The club competes in the Gainbridge Super League, a USL Property, and plays its home games at Beyond Bancard Field on the campus of Nova Southeastern University in Davie.

 Tropical Financial will be the “Official Credit Union” of FTL UTD for the 2025/26 season, which begins August 23 with a home game. The credit union will bring fans closer to the action through immersive game-day activations, community events, and player-focused programs. The collaboration will also include tailored financial education sessions for FTL UTD players and staff, empowering them with tools to manage their personal finances successfully. Tropical Financial will also get branding opportunities in the stadium.

 “At Tropical Financial, we believe in creating deeper community connections and supporting organizations that share our values,” said Rick Shaw, President and CEO of Tropical Financial Credit Union. “FTL UTD represents the spirit of empowerment, ambition, and teamwork—and we’re thrilled to support their mission of elevating women in sports and inspiring the next generation.”

 “We’re proud to welcome Tropical Financial Credit Union as a valued partner of Fort Lauderdale United FC,” said Tommy Smith, Chairman and Founder of Fort Lauderdale United FC. “Their deep roots in the South Florida community and commitment to financial empowerment make them an ideal teammate as we continue to build a club that reflects and uplifts the people we serve.”

 In its first season, FTL UTD scored 37 goals, securing 12 wins, nine draws, and nine losses over a 30-game season which included the semi-finals and finals. They set a league record by scoring at least one goal in eight straight games and had a nine-game unbeaten streak, the second-longest in the league’s history.

 This marks TFCU’s second professional sports partnership. It also proudly serves as the Official Credit Union of the two-time Stanley Cup Champion Florida Panthers.
