# Arlington Capital Partners Forms Neumo, a Leader in Government Modernization

Arlington Capital Partners, a Washington D.C.-area private investment firm specializing in government regulated industries, today announced the formation of Neumo, a new leader in integrated software and payments solutions for local, state, and federal governments. Neumo was formed through the merger of Avenu Insights & Analytics and Intellectual Technology Inc., and the newly completed acquisition of GovOS.

 Neumo offers a comprehensive suite of cloud-based solutions that help governments modernize operations and elevate the quality of services they provide to their communities. Spanning public administration, DMV, revenue compliance, justice, and integrated payments, the Company’s best-in-class products enable customers to drive efficiency, strengthen security, and increase capacity. As a combined business, Neumo is well-positioned to lead the industry through omnichannel solutions that meet constituents where they are, with what they need. The Company is committed to building on its track record of innovation in cloud-based software technology to continually enhance trust, efficiency, and convenience in every interaction between governments and the communities they serve.

 Paul Colangelo, who previously served as CEO of Avenu, will lead Neumo as Chief Executive Officer and will be joined by key members of the ITI and GovOS leadership teams.

 “The need to modernize government represents a historic opportunity,” said Paul Colangelo, CEO of Neumo. “Governments of all kinds face growing challenges related to budgetary pressures, workforce dynamics, and heightened expectations for ease of access to government services. With the combined resources of Neumo, we can transform how governments deliver for the people and businesses they serve, all at scale. Every touchpoint with the community matters, and Neumo will continue to partner with our customers and innovate in ways that enhance those interactions, anytime, anywhere.”

 Neumo’s name reflects the “new momentum” generated by uniting three pioneering IT innovators under one mission. It symbolizes the Company’s commitment to driving progress for governments by transforming manual, inefficient processes into streamlined, integrated solutions that empower agencies to operate with greater speed, precision, and efficiency. Customers will no longer have to deal with disparate vendors; instead, state and local governments can turn to one leading cloud-based platform. With more than 4,500 existing government customers, the Company already processes billions in payments collected by governments and facilitates billions of interactions annually. Neumo has customers in all 50 states and brings together a combined 100 years of experience serving governments.

 “Communities need modern governments capable of meeting them wherever they are, with digital technologies people have come to expect and rely on when accessing services,” said Michael Lustbader, a Managing Partner at Arlington Capital Partners. “Neumo meets this moment by bringing together excellence across a full suite of complementary GovTech software solutions that propel governments forward, while prioritizing user-friendly functionality that powers widespread adoption. Our past experience in the sector reinforces our conviction in the opportunity to scale innovative GovTech platforms like Neumo, and we look forward to working with the entire Neumo team through this next stage of growth.”
