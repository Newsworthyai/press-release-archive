# Playboy To Relocate Global Headquarters to RIVANI Miami Beach

Robert Rivani, the commercial real estate and hospitality visionary known for disrupting traditional asset classes and transforming them into headline-making destinations, announced that Playboy has signed a lease at his flagship project, RIVANI at 1691 Michigan Avenue.

 The new RIVANI Miami Beach building—Rivani’s $100 million “Class X” office redevelopment—will serve as Playboy’s headquarters. Located adjacent to Lincoln Road, the project redefines the workplace by blending five-star hospitality, curated wellness, and elevated design, setting a new benchmark for commercial office buildings.

 “Securing a top-tier, globally recognized company like Playboy underscores the level of prestige and energy we are bringing to RIVANI Miami Beach, and we are excited for the world-class brands that will join them,” says Robert Rivani.

 The announcement coincides with Rivani’s debut of his company’s rebrand from Black Lion to RIVANI — showcasing a commitment to creating revolutionary environments where hospitality, design, wellness, and service converge at the highest level.

 “The rebrand is a pivotal moment for us—it reflects who we are today and where we’re headed,” says Rivani. “Black Lion laid the foundation, and RIVANI is the evolution. We’re continuing to disrupt the industry with a timeless, elegant and intentional approach to lifestyle-driven experiences.”

 Designed by the award-winning Rockwell Group and inspired by Rivani’s hospitality experience, RIVANI Miami Beach offers elevated amenities including a full-service concierge, valet, world-class spa, fitness and wellness center, meditation room, Omakase restaurant, speakeasy, living room-style meeting spaces, and private event venues.

 Rivani has amassed nearly $200 million of prime South Florida assets over the last 10 years, anchored by some of Miami’s most sought-after restaurant and retail spaces. His holdings include marquee destinations such as Amara at Paraiso, the upcoming GAIA, and the fully leased Wynwood Jungle. This year, he made headlines with a string of record-breaking deals, including the $28.2 million sale of Catch Miami Beach—setting a Florida record for a freestanding restaurant—and a $38.25 million all-cash sale of two premier restaurant spaces within SLS Lux Brickell and Dua Miami Hotel (formerly SLS Brickell), marking one of 2025’s most significant hospitality-driven transactions.
