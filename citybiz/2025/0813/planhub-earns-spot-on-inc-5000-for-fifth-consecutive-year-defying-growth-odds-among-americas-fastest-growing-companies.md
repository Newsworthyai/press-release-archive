# PlanHub Earns Spot on Inc. 5000 for Fifth Consecutive Year, Defying Growth Odds Among America’s Fastest-Growing Companies

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., Aug. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — PlanHub, the leading cloud-based preconstruction platform, has once again been named to the Inc. 5000 list of the fastest-growing private companies in America, ranking No. 1786 for 2025. This marks PlanHub’s fifth consecutive appearance on the prestigious list—a milestone that underscores the company’s rare ability to sustain rapid growth over time, even as year-over-year revenue increases make the benchmark for qualification increasingly difficult to meet.

 As companies grow, maintaining the high percentage growth required for the Inc. 5000 becomes significantly more challenging. PlanHub’s five-year streak is a testament to both the scalability of its business model and the enduring demand for its preconstruction solutions.

 In addition to its national recognition, PlanHub also achieved standout rankings:

 * #83 among companies in the Miami–Fort Lauderdale, FL metro area
* #108 in the Construction category
* #180 in the State of Florida

 “Our continued presence on the Inc. 5000 year after year is no small feat—it reflects not just rapid growth, but sustained momentum and execution in a complex, competitive space,” said Ro Bhatia, CEO of PlanHub. “It’s incredibly difficult to maintain the growth ratio needed to qualify once your company hits scale, and yet here we are—five years strong. That speaks volumes about the value we bring to the construction industry and the dedication of our team.”
