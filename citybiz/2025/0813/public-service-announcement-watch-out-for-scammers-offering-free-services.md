# Public Service Announcement: Watch Out for Scammers Offering “Free” Services

Beware of fake “free” services or gifts — protect your Medicare information and stay alert.

 Scammers posing as salespeople may try to trick you into signing up for hospice care without your knowledge.

 Here’s how the scam works:

 * Scammers may contact you by text, phone, email, fake ads or even show up at your door.
* They offer “free” gifts or in-home services such as cooking, cleaning, groceries, protein shakes or medical equipment.
* In exchange, they may ask for your Medicare number and a signature.
* Without your full understanding, you may be enrolled in hospice care so they can fraudulently bill Medicare in your name.

 Protect yourself: Never share your Medicare number or sign anything in exchange for free services. It’s a scam.

 REPORTING MEDICARE FRAUD & ABUSE

 Medicare fraud and abuse can happen anywhere. It’s important to protect your Medicare card, number and other personal information. Be sure to check your Medicare claims regularly.

 To help detect and prevent Medicare fraud and abuse:

 * Compare the dates and services on your calendar with the Medicare statements you receive to ensure you got each service listed and that the details are accurate.
* Safeguard your personal information and understand how Medicare uses it.
* Learn what Medicare health and drug plans can and cannot do before enrolling. If you join a plan, it will inform you how your personal information will be used.

 If you suspect fraud call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) or report Medicare fraud online. If you have a Medicare Advantage Plan or Medicare drug plan you can also call the Investigations Medicare Drug Integrity Contractor (I-MEDIC) at 1-877-7SAFERX (1-877-772-3379).
