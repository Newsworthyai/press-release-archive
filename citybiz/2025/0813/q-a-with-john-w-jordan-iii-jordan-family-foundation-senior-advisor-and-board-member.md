# Q&amp;A with John W. Jordan III, Jordan Family Foundation Senior Advisor and Board Member

John W. Jordan III serves as a senior advisor and board member for the Jordan Family Foundation, helping guide its mission to provide educational, athletic, and social opportunities to underserved youth. In 2025, he will also begin his first season with the Jacksonville Jaguars as Senior Advisor to the General Manager.

 Jordan brings more than two decades of NFL front office experience, including 13 seasons with the Los Angeles Rams, most recently as a scouting consultant after serving six seasons as Director of Draft Management, and nine seasons with the Indianapolis Colts, where he contributed to the 2006 Super Bowl and 2009 AFC Championship teams.

 A graduate of the University of Notre Dame with a bachelor’s degree in finance, Jordan was a two-year letterman for the Fighting Irish football team.

 For those who aren’t familiar, what is the Jordan Scholars Program, and how did it come about?

 The Jordan Scholars Program, the main initiative of the Jordan Family Foundation, is designed to support motivated middle and high school students from underserved communities, by providing scholarships, mentorship, and life skills training. The program was created to give young people access to opportunities they might not otherwise have, helping them grow into confident, capable adults. It reflects the foundation’s broader mission of strengthening communities by investing in youth development, education, and wellness.

 What makes this program unique compared to other scholarship or youth mentorship programs?

 What sets the Jordan Scholars Program apart is its holistic approach. This isn’t just about writing a check… it’s about long-term investment in a student’s growth. We pair students with mentors, provide academic and athletic guidance, organize leadership and character-building workshops, and offer access to enrichment activities like summer camps, athletic training, and community service. Scholars also become part of a tight-knit network that continues to support them beyond high school and into adulthood.

 Who is eligible to become a Jordan Scholar, and what is the application process like?

 In partnership with Archbishop McCarthy High School in Southwest Ranches, FL, a suburb of Fort Lauderdale, the Foundation primarily serves Broward and Dade counties in south Florida. We have a staff of educators and administrators with ‘boots on the ground,’ so to speak, who spend countless hours engaging with lower income communities in an effort to identify strong middle school candidates that might become Jordan Scholars.

 We also have a website, jordanfamilyfoundation.com, where anyone interested in becoming a scholar can directly apply by filling out a brief application and submitting their transcript and report card.

 Can you share an example of the program’s impact?

 Absolutely. Brian Flores, the former Miami Dolphins Head Coach and current Minnesota Vikings Defensive Coordinator, was a Jordan Scholar, class of 1999 at Poly Prep Country Day School in Brooklyn, NY. He went on to star at Linebacker for Boston College before graduating with a business degree and embarking on his wildly successful career as an NFL executive and coach. Like so many others, all Brian needed as a child was the opportunity to thrive and brings his natural talents to light. The Foundation was and is honored and privileged to help give him that opportunity.

 How does the Jordan Family Foundation continue supporting scholars once they graduate high school?

 With rare exception, we remain a part of all our Scholars’ lives. Many of our alumni return as mentors, interns, or speakers for our leadership events. That “full circle” experience is powerful. We also help them find college and career opportunities, connect them with professionals in their field of interest, and offer ongoing encouragement as they reach the next stages of their lives.

 Where can people go to learn more or apply?

 Again, anyone can visit jordanfamilyfoundation.com to learn more about the program and apply. We also encourage community members, educators, and youth leaders to recommend students who they think would benefit.
