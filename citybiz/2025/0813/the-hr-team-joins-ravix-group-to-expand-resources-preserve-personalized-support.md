# The HR Team Joins Ravix Group to Expand Resources, Preserve Personalized Support

The HR Team, a trusted provider of outsourced human resources solutions for organizations across the Mid-Atlantic, is excited to announce that as of August 1, 2025, it has joined forces with Ravix Group, a national firm specializing in back-office solutions for growing organizations.

 For over 30 years, The HR Team has proudly served clients across Maryland, DC, and beyond with practical, people-focused HR services tailored to each organization’s unique culture and needs. This new partnership with Ravix Group expands its access to national resources, thought leadership, and complementary services—all while keeping what matters most exactly the same: its team, relationships, and the personalized support its clients count on.

 “This is a meaningful next chapter for The HR Team,” said Eileen Levitt, Founder and President of The HR Team. “We’re growing—but we’re not changing what makes us special. Our clients will still work with the same trusted consultants, and I’ll continue supporting the team and our clients in a new role as Executive Advisor.”

 Ravix Group is a part of Kingsway Financial Services (NYSE: KFS), a public company that acquires and builds high-performing service businesses. The HR Team’s expertise in outsourced HR, compliance, and organizational development adds strength to Ravix’s broader service offerings and brings new opportunities for growth—particularly in the nonprofit, membership, and government sectors where The HR Team has deep roots.

 “The HR Team is a strong strategic and cultural fit for Ravix,” said Timi Okah, CEO of Ravix. “Strategically, the acquisition expands our capabilities in HR services, strengthens our presence on the East Coast, and accelerates our growth in the nonprofit, membership organization, and government services verticals.

 Clients can expect a seamless transition. Day-to-day contacts and service levels remain unchanged. The only noticeable difference will be that invoices will now come from Ravix Group.
