# Stretch Zone Ranks on the 2025 Inc. 5000 List of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla, Aug. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Inc., the leading media brand and playbook for the entrepreneurs and business leaders shaping our future, today announced that Stretch Zone has ranked on the annual Inc. 5000 list, the most prestigious ranking of the fastest-growing private companies in America. The list provides a data-driven snapshot of the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses.

 “Being ranked in the Inc. 5000 list is a reflection of the hard work our team and franchisees put in every day to bring the benefits of practitioner-assisted stretching to communities across the country,” said Tony Zaccario, CEO of Stretch Zone. “As demand for wellness services continues to grow, this recognition reinforces that our unique approach is resonating and making a meaningful impact in people’s lives.”

 Stretch Zone has quickly become a standout brand in the wellness franchise space, pioneering the practice of practitioner-assisted stretching with a science-backed methodology that’s helping people move and feel better. With more than 400 locations opened and zero studio failures to date, the brand’s rapid growth is a testament to its proven business model, strong franchisee support, and increasing demand for recovery-focused wellness services. In 2025, Stretch Zone introduced Systemwide Access—a first-of-its-kind member benefit allowing members to stretch at any location nationwide—further reinforcing its commitment to convenience, consistency, and community as it continues to scale across the U.S.

 This year’s Inc. 5000 honorees have demonstrated exceptional growth while navigating economic uncertainty, inflationary pressure, and a fluctuating labor market. Among the top 500 companies on the list, the median three-year revenue growth rate reached 1,552 percent, and those companies have collectively added more than 48,678 jobs to the U.S. economy over the past three years.

 “Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” says Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm—they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”

 Inc. will celebrate the honorees at the 2025 Inc. 5000 Conference & Gala, taking place October 22–24 in Phoenix, and the top 500 will be listed in the Fall issue of Inc. magazine.
