# Q&amp;A with Kris Beevers, CEO of NetBox Labs: Modernizing the Plumbing Behind Today’s Digital Infrastructure

NetBox Labs helps organizations model, manage, and automate their complex infrastructure — from AI data centers to global enterprise networks. The company is the commercial steward of NetBox, a widely adopted open source platform used by thousands of engineering teams as their daily source of truth.

 Co-founder and CEO Kris Beevers and his team have turned that grassroots adoption into a fast-growing business. With $35M in Series B funding, NetBox Labs is scaling its product, engineering, and go-to-market teams to meet rising demand from enterprises racing to modernize aging infrastructure and deliver new digital capabilities at scale.

 We want to build a company that defines the future of infrastructure management and improves the lives of the engineers who do this work every day

 In this Q&A, Beevers explains why traditional tools are breaking down, what’s changing in the world of infrastructure, and how NetBox became the system of record for teams building everything from AI clouds to national transportation networks.

 What problem does NetBox Labs solve, and what led you to build the company?

 Digital infrastructure is more essential than ever, but it’s harder than ever to manage. Networks are more complex, systems change constantly, and many teams still rely on out-of-date spreadsheets or vendor-specific tools that don’t scale.

 We solve that problem with a modern system of record. Just like sales teams use Salesforce or marketers use HubSpot, infrastructure teams log into NetBox every day. They use the platform to document their infrastructure, model changes, plan deployments, and trigger automation.

 NetBox started as an open source project inside a cloud company and became the de facto standard for infrastructure modeling. I saw that adoption firsthand while running my previous company. Our customers and engineers were using NetBox everywhere. That inspired me to build the commercial business around it.

 Who are your typical customers and how do they use NetBox?

 We serve organizations with large, complex infrastructure that can’t afford to get it wrong.

 On one end of the spectrum, you’ve got hyperscalers like CoreWeave, who use NetBox to launch new AI data centers faster. On the other end, we serve enterprises like JPMorgan Chase, government agencies like various Departments of Transportation, and global tech companies like Arm. Their use cases range from onboarding new infrastructure to maintaining compliance across vast networks of routers, servers, and connected devices.

 NetBox gives them a single source of truth — a shared data model that drives automation, governance, and operational speed across teams.

 What’s driving demand for this type of infrastructure software right now?

 The world’s infrastructure footprint is exploding. It’s more voluminous, more complex, and more dynamic than it was even five years ago. And yet, many teams are still managing it manually or using legacy tooling that’s out of step with reality.

 From AI clouds to legacy networks, the demands are the same: move faster, reduce risk, and stay in control. NetBox gives teams the visibility and structure to do that. Whether building greenfield infrastructure or modernizing brownfield environments, the need for scalable, reliable infrastructure management is now critical.

 How does AI factor into your growth and product roadmap?

 We’re the software that makes AI possible. Every AI system, from LLMs to agentic models, runs on infrastructure, such as racks, servers, GPUs, power, and networking. Our software helps orchestrate that complexity.

 At the same time, we’re investing in our AI capabilities. One example is NetBox Operator, an AI-native system that can reason about infrastructure and act within human-defined guardrails. We see AI as a tailwind driving more infrastructure investment and as a set of technologies we can harness to make infrastructure management even smarter.

 You mentioned NetBox’s open-source roots. How does that impact the commercial business?

 It’s one of our greatest strengths. The open source version of NetBox is already used by thousands of organizations worldwide, from Cloudflare and Wikipedia to banks and telcos. That grassroots adoption creates a built-in community, brand, and distribution model.

 As NetBox’s commercial stewards, we invest heavily in the open source core and build enterprise products around it that add automation, security, observability, and scale. Our customers get the best of both worlds with trusted open source software and battle-tested commercial support.

 What’s your long-term vision for NetBox Labs?

 We want to build a company that defines the future of infrastructure management and improves the lives of the engineers who do this work every day. That means continuing to scale globally, invest in open source, and deliver products that give teams clarity and control in the face of growing complexity.

 We believe every infrastructure team — whether they’re building AI clouds, enterprise networks, or public systems — should have a system of record they trust. That’s why we’ve built a platform that helps the world’s infrastructure teams cut through the complexity and take back control.
