# Thompson Thrift Earns a Spot on Inc. 5000 List of Fastest-Growing Private Companies for 10th Time

Thompson Thrift, a full-service nationally recognized real estate company and one of the nation’s leading multifamily developers, ranked No. 3,801 on the 2025 Inc. 5000 list of the fastest-growing private companies in America, marking the company’s third straight year appearing on the list and its 10th time appearing overall.

 “This recognition reflects the strength of our long-term vision and the dedication of our talented team,” said Dan Sink, president and chief financial officer of Thompson Thrift. “Earning a place on the Inc. 5000 for the 10th time underscores our ability to grow strategically, deliver value for our partners and make a lasting impact in the communities we serve.”

 Each year, Inc. evaluates thousands of U.S. private companies based on their revenue growth over a three-year period. The prestigious ranking provides a data-driven look at the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Entrants undergo a rigorous selection process, which highlights the economic impact and entrepreneurial spirit of the featured organizations. Past honorees include household names such as Microsoft, Patagonia and Oracle, solidifying the list’s significance as an indicator of long-term success in the business world.

 “Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” says Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm—they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”

 Along with the overall ranking, Thompson Thrift also ranked No. 33 in Indiana and No. 85 in the real estate category.

 Beyond the numbers, the accolade highlights the company’s continued impact on America’s multifamily housing. Since adding a multifamily business unit in 2008, Thompson Thrift has reached over $6.5 million in volume and developed over 90 residential communities across 23 states. Their portfolio emphasizes construction efficiency and an end product that has been tried and tested, winning residents’ approval through many builds and leases.

 Thompson Thrift has earned additional national recognition this year with a 2025 Top Workplaces USA award as well as a 2025 Top Apartment Developer and Top Builder from the National Multifamily Housing Council. The company was also honored as Developer of the Year by REjournals at the 2025 Indiana Commercial Real Estate Awards.

 Since its founding nearly 40 years ago, Thompson Thrift has invested more than $6 billion into local communities and has become known as a trusted partner committed to developing high-quality, attractive multifamily communities and commercial projects across the Midwest, Southeast and Southwest.
