# 24 Seven Named to Inc. 5000 List of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies for Second Consecutive Year

24 Seven, one of the nation’s largest privately held marketing, creative, and digital talent solutions firms, has been named to the 2025 Inc. 5000 list of America’s fastest-growing private companies, marking the firm’s second consecutive year receiving this prestigious recognition.

 Compiled annually by Inc. magazine, the Inc. 5000 list honors the most successful independent companies across the U.S. economy – those that have demonstrated sustained growth and innovation in a competitive business environment.

 The repeat honor for 24 Seven is especially notable given broader conditions in the staffing and talent solutions space. According to Staffing Industry Analysts (SIA), a majority of staffing firms experienced revenue declines in 2024, making 24 Seven’s continued growth a standout achievement that positions the company among an elite group of resilient industry leaders.

 “Being named to the Inc. 5000 list again is a powerful reflection of the value we’re creating for our clients and talent,” said Anthony Donnarumma, CEO of 24 Seven. “At a time when many in our space are struggling, we’ve remained focused on expanding our capabilities and helping organizations grow with the right talent solutions and managed services. This recognition is a testament to the dedication of our entire team, and it validates our approach during a period when agility and adaptability is so crucial.”

24 Seven’s sustained growth stems from a combination of organic expansion and a strategic acquisition model. The company has completed nine acquisitions in recent years, broadening its reach across staffing, managed services, and artificial intelligence. Today, 24 Seven operates as a comprehensive talent solutions provider, supporting clients across marketing, creative, digital, and technology functions.

 This 2025 Inc. 5000 recognition adds to a growing list of accolades for 24 Seven this year, including:

 * Forbes 2025 America’s Best Recruiting and Temporary Staffing Firms
* ClearlyRated’s Best of Staffing® Client Award and Best of Staffing® Talent Award
* SIA’s Largest Staffing Firm and Largest Marketing/Creative Staffing Firm lists
* Fortune Certified as a Great Place to Work® for the third year in a row
