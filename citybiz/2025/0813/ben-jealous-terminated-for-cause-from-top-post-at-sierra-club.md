# Ben Jealous Terminated ‘For Cause’ From Top Post At Sierra Club

The Sierra Club’s board voted unanimously to remove Executive Director Ben Jealous for cause, a month after he was placed on leave, according to an email sent Monday to the environmental nonprofit’s staff.

 The vote came after an “extensive evaluation” of Jealous’ conduct, according to the email from board President Patrick Murphy. The email did not describe the particular reasons for Jealous’ ouster.

 Jealous, a former Democratic nominee for Maryland governor, was placed on leave last month over what a Sierra Club spokesperson would only describe as a “personnel matter.”

 “The Sierra Club leads with our values,” Murphy wrote in Monday’s email. “That’s how we engage in communities across the country, how we fulfill our mission and achieve our goals, and how we interact with one another and our organization.

 “The decision the Board made was a difficult but principled one to uphold these values and ensure every individual at the Sierra Club is held equally accountable, with no special treatment or favor for those holding influence and power,” his email went on to say.

 In a statement issued through a spokesperson Tuesday, Jealous said that he had initiated a “process under my contract” to fight the termination.

 “It is disheartening, unfortunate, but perhaps not surprising that the board has chosen an adversarial course that the facts so clearly cannot support,” Jealous wrote in the statement.
