# RapDev Secures Spot on Inc. 5000 List of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies For the Third Consecutive Year

Inc. magazine today announced that RapDev has ranked No. 2047 on its annual Inc. 5000 list, a ranking of the fastest-growing private companies in the United States. Compiled annually by Inc. Magazine, the list recognizes the most successful and dynamic organizations contributing to the country’s economy through innovation, resilience, and consistent revenue growth.

 “Being named to the Inc. 5000 is a milestone we’re incredibly proud of,” said Tameem Hourani, Founder of RapDev. “This recognition reflects the impact of our engineering-first approach, the trust our customers place in us, and the passion our team brings to solving complex challenges across observability, automation, and AI.”

 RapDev’s growth has been fueled by its expansion into global markets, development of proprietary ServiceNow and Datadog applications, and its automation-led approach to scaling environments for some of the world’s largest enterprises.

 The company’s patented ServiceNow innovations, including CSDM as Code, which accelerates data model adoption, and Tag Generator (Patent pending), which enhances infrastructure governance, are redefining how large organizations manage and scale their operations.

 Alongside its Managed Datadog and Managed SOC offerings, which give enterprises the speed, visibility, and control to modernize operations without losing momentum, RapDev continues to expand its footprint through innovation. The company’s newest AI-powered observability assistant, Arlo, brings intelligent automation to engineering teams, enabling faster incident triage, streamlined observability, and real-time insights through natural language interfaces across tools like Windows and ServiceNow.

 As RapDev grows its global team of engineers and AI specialists, the company remains focused on delivering scalable solutions that drive enterprise-wide outcomes. With a sharp eye on expanding into new markets and advancing automation through AI, RapDev is building the future of observability, one intelligent workflow at a time.
