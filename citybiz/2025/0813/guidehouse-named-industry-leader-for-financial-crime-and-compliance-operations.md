# Guidehouse Named Industry Leader for Financial Crime and Compliance Operations

Guidehouse, a global AI-led professional services firm, has been named a Leader in the 2025 Everest Group PEAK Matrix for Financial Crime and Compliance (FCC) Operations Services. The firm stands out among global service providers for its bold strategic vision, exceptional delivery, and powerful market influence.

 This recognition reinforces Guidehouse’s position as a trusted partner to financial institutions navigating the evolving landscape of financial crime and regulatory pressure. The Everest Group PEAK Matrix® is a proprietary assessment framework that evaluates FCC operations providers across criteria such as market presence, delivery footprint, innovation, and client satisfaction—helping enterprises identify the most capable partners for their compliance needs.

 “Being named a Leader by Everest Group is a testament to our team’s relentless focus on helping clients stay ahead of rapidly evolving financial crime risks,” said Eli Morillo, Partner, Managed Services, Guidehouse. “As the youngest and fastest-growing firm in our category, we’re proud to be recognized for delivering measurable outcomes through innovation, insight, and execution.”

 Guidehouse’s FCC capabilities span anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC), enhanced due diligence (EDD), sanctions screening, fraud prevention, regulatory remediation, program transformation and optimization. These services are delivered through a blended model that integrates advisory, technology, and managed services—enabling clients to modernize operations, reduce risk, and improve compliance outcomes.

 This latest recognition follows the firm’s July 2025 announcement of a $1.5 billion investment over the next three years to accelerate AI-led transformation across multiple industries, including financial services. The investment will establish a global AI Center of Excellence, develop proprietary multi-agent AI architectures, and deliver flagship deployments in collaboration with leading AI ecosystem partners.

 Guidehouse’s strong domain expertise, client-centric delivery model, and ability to co-innovate with clients to address both immediate and long-term regulatory demands are key differentiators that set the firm apart in the financial crime and compliance space.

 At the core of this model is Guidehouse’s AI-led approach. Purpose-built to meet the demands of complex, regulated environments, Guidehouse embeds AI across the FCC life cycle—from intelligent case triage and risk scoring to predictive analytics and workflow automation. This approach empowers clients to streamline operations, reduce false positives, and respond to threats with greater speed and precision.

 “We are committed to building future-ready FCC solutions that not only respond to today’s compliance pressures but also anticipate tomorrow’s threats,” said Jessica Stallmeyer, Leader of Financial Services at Guidehouse. “Our AI-led, tech-embedded model enables us to deliver precision at scale—helping clients transform compliance from a cost center into a strategic advantage.”
