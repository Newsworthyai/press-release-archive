 Bill served as CEO of AARP during my tenure on the leadership team. He is a trusted and valued friend, as well as a mentor whose guidance I continue to appreciate.

 

 What defining moment in your career most shaped your approach to leadership?

 First, I had to learn that I could lead. My first job was at Unilever in New York. I was in marketing and assigned declining (“pallbearers”) brands. But, I was able to get promoted to product manager (the youngest person up to that time) and given a significant product launch (a laundry detergent) with company-wide importance. This was the big time, and I was leading the way. Second came my “lightbulb leadership moment.” I visited a prominent Madison Avenue ad agency and was still marketing packaged goods (such as kids’ cereal and pet food)—still no social relevance to my work. I was assigned a new client – public television (to build an audience). I attended a press conference hosted by Joan Ganz Cooney, who announced to the assembled media that public TV was about to revolutionize kids’ education with a new program: Sesame Street. It was my breakthrough moment. I saw Cooney as both an educator and a marketer. I could utilize my marketing skills to promote consumer goods, as well as ideas, causes, and issues (such as education). It marked the beginning of my pivot to a new career, which would come to be known as social marketing. It was what I could lead in.

 Beyond profit, what metric do you consider most essential to an organization’s success?

 It is purpose. Every successful business or any other organization benefits from a deep purpose. A purpose energizes and inspires beyond the quest for profit. It helps make employees believe in the organization and its leadership. Even a mundane product line can energize employees when it is connected to a purpose. Coca-Cola recently changed its mission from ‘refresh the world’ to also ‘serve the world.’ The purpose is powerful.

 How do you stay authentic while adapting to constant change?

 For me, there are three things: first, my career goal (to make significant contributions to solving major social problems); second, the fact that I have never chased money (enough money has come my way as a result of my work); and third, staying humble. I am not the smartest person in the room. I know that.

 What strategies do you use to attract, inspire, and retain top talent?

 People want to join my organization because of its purpose (they believe, as I do, in the cause). They stay because of the positive corporate culture and because I strongly believe in teamwork. Virtually everything I’ve ever accomplished has been the result of teamwork. No one, including the CEO, can make the majority of decisions driving an organization’s performance. Therefore, it’s essential to have strong, well-led, and well-performing teams. Talented people appreciate this responsibility and latitude. You don’t have to be the CEO or even on the executive team to be a leader. You can lead from the middle.

 How do you align profitability with long-term value creation for all stakeholders?

 I believe companies can do well by doing good. It’s sometimes called the triple bottom line (people, planet, profit). The idea is that a company can improve its bottom line (profitability) as a consequence of creating positive results for its other stakeholders (e.g., employees, suppliers, customers) and society. This can be an essential pathway to business success.

 Can you share a story about a mentor who significantly influenced your leadership journey?

 Most everybody, including me, has benefited from positive mentors. I would like to cite what I refer to as a “negative mentor.” I once had a brilliant boss who humiliated people. I learned two lessons from him that I have carried through my career: how not to treat others and excellent marketing skills. Treating people well should be a self-evident and competitive advantage.

 In your view, what is the most critical leadership skill – and why?

 There are several (see above), but perhaps the most vital characteristic is not a skill but courage. Be not afraid to do the right thing, to demonstrate hard work, to relish a good fight. I’ve taken on the tobacco industry, fought to get prescription drugs into Medicare, and challenged the pharmaceutical industry over drug costs. You usually can’t make major changes without fighting the good fight, and that takes courage. Sitting on our hands and hoping is not a good leadership strategy.
