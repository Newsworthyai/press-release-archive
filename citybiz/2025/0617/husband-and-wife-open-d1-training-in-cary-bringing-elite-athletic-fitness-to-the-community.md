# Husband and Wife Open D1 Training in Cary, Bringing Elite Athletic Fitness to the Community

State-of-the-Art Facility to Empower Youth and Adult Athletes

 D1 Training, a leading fitness enrichment concept utilizing the five core tenets of athletic-based training, recently opened a new location in Cary at 1279 NW Maynard Rd on June 9. The new group fitness facility employs a sports-science backed training regimen led by certified trainers to help people of all ages achieve their sport and fitness goals.

 Darren and Mariann Mock will join an impressive roster of existing franchisees, along with professional athlete brand partners, including NBA star Chris Paul and Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow.

 Mariann has built a successful career in technology sales, working with industry-leading companies and honing her skills in sales leadership and business development.

 Darren, on the other hand, spent over 20 years in the technology industry before transitioning to entrepreneurship. In 2019, he built an insurance company from the ground up, growing it into a respected provider of insurance and financial solutions across Florida. After years of steady expansion, he sold the business in 2024, opening the door for the duos next venture—D1 Training.

 Before becoming D1 Training owners, the Mocks were searching for a facility where their three kids could train and develop their athletic skills before high school. When they realized nothing like that existed in the area, they saw an opportunity to fill the gap. Bringing D1 Training to the community wasn’t just about opening a business—it was about creating a space where both youth and adults could train, grow, and reach their fitness goals while giving back to the community they love.

 “With group training classes like those at D1, it’s incredible to see people build their own communities, pushing each other to reach their fitness goals,” said Darren. “I spent many years working out alone, but I’ve seen firsthand how group fitness helps people grow together and connect with others they might not have met otherwise. Whether it’s young athletes working to improve in a sport, or adults training towards personal goals – D1 perfectly aligns with our passion for fitness.”

 D1 Training offers four age-based programs including Rookie (ages 7-11), Developmental (ages 12-14), Prep (ages 15-18) and D1 Adult. Each fitness program is based on the five athletic-based tenets: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down. Outside of group workouts, D1 Training offers group, semi-private, and one-on-one training with world-class coaches. The goal is simple: to train athletes who are dedicated to their sport or fitness goals, regardless of age, or athletic background.

 “Darren and Mariann are the ideal candidates to bring the D1 Training experience to Cary,” said the brand’s Chief Operating Officer, Dan Murphy. “We’re thrilled to welcome them to the D1 family and are confident in their ability to show the Cary area what they’ve been missing out on. D1 is a one-of-a-kind fitness experience that’s built around the individual and meant to help people meet their athletic goals. Our strong network of franchisees embodies our core values to bring the D1 Training vision to life, and we know Darren and Mariann will do just that in Cary and its surrounding communities.”

 Strategically expanding across the nation through franchising, D1 Training has more than 100 performance centers open with over 100 additional locations in various stages of development. The brand is currently seeking financially qualified business builders, former athletes, and entrepreneurs, who share a passion for fitness and youth sports, who are ready to make a positive impact on their community.
