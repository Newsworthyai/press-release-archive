# Step Right Up, Palm Beach County! Mr. Swindle’s Peculiarium &amp; Drink-Ory Garden Returns To Boca Raton (Feb. 12–22) And Jupiter (Feb. 26–March 22)

Prepare to be swindled! The Great Mr. Swindle’s Traveling Peculiarium and Drink-Ory Garden® returns to Palm Beach County for a 2026 tour that’s playfully naughty and impossible to forget. Led by the ever-mischievous Mr. B.S. Swindler, this ninety-minute immersive spectacle promises astonishing feats, eccentric comedy, and a cast of peculiar characters certain to leave guests roaring with laughter and utterly amazed. The mayhem and marvels will unfold beneath the Big Top in Boca Raton, February 12–22 and Carlin Park in Jupiter, February 26–March 22.

 This year the Peculiarium itself is part of the wonder. Guests will step inside a brand-new custom crafted boutique Big Top dressed in elegant grey-and-crème stripes with burgundy trim, complete with comfortable, cushioned seating for maximum comfort. “Only the finest for the posteriors of my lavish guests,” teases Mr. Swindle, whose taste for the extravagant is as grand as his sense of mischief. And of course, Mr. Swindle has it all under control—climate control, that is—with a big top fully equipped with both air-conditioning and heat to ensure the perfect experience.

 Arrive early and wander into Dr. Elixir’s Drink-Ory Garden, opening an hour before showtime and brimming with creative cocktails, brews, and bites to set the night’s mischievous tone. This pre-show indulgence tempts even the most well-behaved to loosen up before the real revelry begins.

 “This season marks the ninth year since our debut in 2018, and each year we’re thrilled to welcome both first-time guests and our loyal returning visitors. It’s truly humbling when patrons tell us they’ve attended every year and eagerly anticipate the next season. We know that not many shows inspire such repeat attendance, and we take great pride in that. Our mission is to craft a fresh, unforgettable experience each year—one that leaves guests pleasantly astonished, thoroughly entertained, and brimming with laughter. Watching the joy and energy radiate from our tent each night is an absolute delight.” shared Ivan España, the show’s co-producer.

 As always, Mr. Swindle has new surprises up his perfectly tailored sleeve. The 2026 cast features all-new acrobatic acts and deliciously twisted comedy, plus the return of an audience favorite: the legendary banana act! The bananas are part of a hysterically absurd routine performed by the comedic duo Jonathan Taylor and Anne Goldmann of Daredevil Chicken, who have showcased their artistry all over the world. Adding to the mischief, Dr. Elixir will be portrayed this season by the incomparable Frank Ferrante, a masterful emcee with the panache of a vaudevillian Catskill comedian. Overflowing with surprises, his quick-witted, audience-driven improv will leave audiences brimming with laughter and wanting more.

 Behind all the cheeky laughs beats a generous heart. Since its debut in 2018, the Peculiarium has raised more than $150,000 for local organizations. A swindler or a Robin Hood? Perhaps a bit of both.
