# Deloitte’s 2025 Digital Transformation Report Ignored the CPQ Crisis

Every January, Deloitte’s annual Digital Transformation Report sets the tone for boardroom conversations across industries. The 2025 report is no exception, highlighting three major priorities shaping transformation agendas: AI adoption, cloud migration, and data analytics.

 These priorities are important, but there’s a glaring omission. Deloitte’s report completely overlooks a critical, and rapidly escalating, revenue operations crisis that’s undermining growth initiatives at many of the very enterprises investing billions in transformation.

 While 89% of enterprises invest billions in digital transformation, most ignore the critical bottleneck killing their growth: A CPQ landscape in complete disarray, where legacy systems are dying, promised replacements aren’t ready, and customers are trapped in expensive limbo.

 Executives are being pushed to modernize their technology stack while their Configure, Price, Quote (CPQ) systems—the core engines of revenue generation—are collapsing beneath them.

 Consulting Firms Are Missing the Mark

 Global consulting firms like Deloitte are trusted advisors for enterprise transformation; however, their frameworks often underestimate the operational realities of revenue generation. In most transformation projects, Revenue Operations receives less than 3% of the total budget, despite being the infrastructure that supports every customer interaction and directly impacts revenue recognition, forecasting, and deal velocity.

 The consequences are severe. Sales teams are stuck with slow, error-prone quoting processes; finance leaders lack visibility into deal data, leading to unreliable forecasts; and customers experience friction, delays, and pricing mistakes that erode trust.

 Deloitte’s omission reflects a larger trend. Strategic plans are disconnected from frontline execution, creating a widening gap between boardroom strategy and day-to-day reality.

 The Hidden Bottleneck in Digital Transformation

 Across industries, CPQ has become the most overlooked weak point in the digital transformation journey. While Deloitte’s report paints a picture of AI-driven futures and seamless digital experiences, enterprises are quietly struggling with quoting and deal processes that are slowing sales cycles, alienating customers, and draining margins.

 Most companies today face an impossible decision:

 * Stay with legacy CPQ systems that are no longer supported or capable of handling complex, subscription-driven business models.
* Move to unproven replacements, like Salesforce Revenue Cloud, which comes with integration risk, uncertain ROI, and high migration costs.

 This is no longer a theoretical problem. Salesforce recently announced the end-of-sale for its legacy CPQ product, forcing thousands of organizations into an urgent and expensive decision-making cycle.

 In the rush to modernize, enterprises are discovering that digital transformation initiatives fail when the revenue engine is broken. DealHub’s State of CPQ report shows that without a solid CPQ foundation, AI, cloud, and analytics investments won’t deliver the expected impact.

 Market Reality Check: Solving the CPQ Crisis

 While consulting firms debate theoretical transformation frameworks, forward-thinking companies are taking practical action to fix their quoting and revenue systems.

 Consider LifeRaft, which replaced its legacy Salesforce CPQ system with DealHub to eliminate manual work, improve sales-finance alignment, and deliver clearer, more accurate quotes. The result was an 80% increase in the average selling price. Faster approvals, reduced errors, and renewals that no longer slipped through the cracks further bolstered their ROI.

 Intuit faced similar challenges as it scaled its mid-market and enterprise sales teams. They implemented DealHub in just eight weeks, cut proposal turnaround times from seven days to 48 hours, and scaled to support over 200 sellers without adding unnecessary overhead.

 These examples show that modern CPQ solutions can be implemented quickly, without the long, costly consulting projects many executives have come to expect. Companies that act now are streamlining revenue processes, mitigating risk, and accelerating growth while competitors remain stuck waiting for validation.

 Why This Crisis Matters for CEOs, CFOs, and CROs

 For executive teams, the implications are stark.

 * CFOs face increasing pressure to produce accurate forecasts and revenue reports, but are hamstrung by unreliable CPQ data.
* CROs must accelerate sales velocity while navigating broken quoting workflows and frustrated sales teams.
* CEOs are betting on digital transformation ROI, only to discover their transformation efforts are built on a shaky foundation.

 When revenue operations are ignored, every other investment delivers diminished returns. Worse, it creates a dangerous illusion of progress while core systems remain broken.

 Strategic leaders are beginning to recognize this risk. They aren’t waiting for consulting validation; they’re moving now to modernize their CPQ stack, protect revenue streams, and create a stable foundation for broader transformation.

 Don’t Build on a Broken Foundation

 Deloitte’s report highlights important trends, but it leaves executives dangerously unprepared for the reality of modern revenue operations.

 The message for CEOs, CFOs, and CROs is clear: Before investing millions in digital transformation projects, stabilize your revenue engine. Without a reliable CPQ foundation, every other transformation initiative is at risk of failure.

 Enterprises that recognize and act on this now are already proving what’s possible. Modern CPQ implementations, completed in weeks, are driving measurable ROI while consulting firms are still writing reports.

 Digital transformation success isn’t about theory—it’s about execution. And in 2025, execution begins with fixing the broken systems at the heart of your revenue operations.
