# Sheehy Auto Stores Shares Top Must-Have Items for Your Vehicle Emergency Kit

As part of the Virginia Department of Health’s annual Emergency Preparedness Month event on September 3 at Capitol Square in Richmond, Sheehy Auto Stores is reminding drivers that one of the simplest—and most overlooked—ways to stay safe during unexpected situations is to keep a stocked vehicle emergency kit.

 Sheehy’s Top Vehicle Emergency Kit Essentials

 Sheehy Auto Stores recommends including the following must-have items in your car at all times:

 * Jumper cables – For a quick battery boost when no roadside help is nearby
* Flares or reflective triangle – To make your car visible if stranded at night or on a highway shoulder
* First aid kit and pain relievers like Ibuprofen or Advil – For minor injuries until professional help arrives
* Car phone charger – To keep your phone powered in an emergency
* Gallon of water and non-perishable snacks (granola or protein bars) – In case you’re stranded for an extended period
* Blanket, flashlight, and hand warmers – To stay warm and visible during cold-weather breakdowns
* Multi-purpose emergency tool and small tool kit – For basic roadside fixes
* Seasonal supplies (ice scraper, umbrella, rain jacket, sunglasses, towel) – Tailored to current weather conditions
* Extra clothing, paper towels, and face masks – For added comfort, cleanliness, and safety

 Drivers are also encouraged to use the Virginia Department of Transportation’s 511 Virginia system for real-time updates on traffic, road closures, and emergencies. The service is available at 511Virginia.org or by dialing 511 while in the state.

 By participating in the Emergency Preparedness Month event, Sheehy Auto Stores is helping spread awareness about simple steps drivers can take to stay ready for anything on the road.
