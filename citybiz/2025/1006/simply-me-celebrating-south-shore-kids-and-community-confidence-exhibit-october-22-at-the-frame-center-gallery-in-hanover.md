# Simply Me: Celebrating South Shore Kids and Community Confidence exhibit October 22 at The Frame Center Gallery in Hanover

Mark your calendars for a special Simply Me evening event October 22 to salute photography, children and community confidence.

 Come and see a special art exhibit Wednesday, October 22, from 6 to 7:30 p.m. at the Frame Center Gallery, 152 Rockland Street, Hanover, MA.

 South Shore artist Isabella Ripley is hosting this special community photography project, Simply Me, designed to celebrate childhood identity and confidence. The project displays each child’s professional portrait alongside their own self-portrait drawing ̶ ̶ an imaginative pairing that gives children the chance to see themselves as artists, superstars, and valued members of the community.

 These are photographs of children throughout the South Shore, ages 3 to 12, that the photographer has taken, working closely with families and children.

 The open house is part of a one-month exhibition which, Mrs. Ripley says, “Brings families, neighbors, and the community together to cheer on our kids and remind us of the importance of celebrating who they are right now.” The exhibit will be open daily October 6 to November 3.

 The heart of Simply Me is about building self-worth through art. By giving children a professional portrait and pairing it with their own drawing, we not only preserve childhood memories but also strengthen their confidence ̶ ̶ and invite the whole community to celebrate them.

 For Isabella, this project is deeply personal. “When my parents divorced, I had one portrait of myself that became a constant. It hung in my living room and reminded me that I was still important, still seen, still loved. That printed photograph became an anchor for me. Simply Me was born out of that experience the belief that a printed piece of artwork can help a child hold onto their confidence, even when life shifts around them.”

 Come and see these portraits and self-portraits! Highlights of the event include:

 • Red carpet entrance for kids

 • VIP tags for all participants

 • Scavenger hunt designed for children

 • Swag bags for families

 • Raffle with a chance to win a portrait session

 • Light refreshments
