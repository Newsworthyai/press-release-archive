# Painting the Town: Canvas Returns to Hollywood

The Hollywood Historical Society, with support from the City of Hollywood, will celebrate the City of Hollywood’s 100th Anniversary by welcoming audiences to a special hometown screening of Canvas — the award-winning film created by Hollywood native and Hollywood Hills High School graduate Joseph Greco. The free community event will take place on Saturday, November 1, 2025, at 7:30 PM at Hollywood Cinema Paradiso, 2008 Hollywood Blvd, offering residents a chance to experience the beloved film on the big screen in the very city where it was made.

 Inspired by Greco’s own childhood, Canvas was filmed in and around Hollywood, Florida, capturing the city’s charm and character on screen. From its vibrant neighborhoods to familiar streets and landmarks, scenes throughout the movie will resonate deeply with residents who will recognize pieces of their hometown woven into the film’s heartfelt story.

 “Bringing Canvas back to Hollywood, where it all began, is deeply meaningful to me,” said Greco. “This city shaped who I am as a person and a filmmaker, and I’m honored to share this film — and this milestone moment — with the community that inspired it.”

 Starring Academy Award winner Marcia Gay Harden, Joe Pantoliano, and Devon Gearhart, Canvas earned critical acclaim on the festival circuit — winning awards at the Rome Film Festival, Roger Ebert’s own Ebertfest, and numerous audience choice honors for its moving portrayal of love, loss, and resilience in the face of mental illness.

 While the film is currently available to stream on Apple TV, this is a rare opportunity to experience Canvas on the big screen, surrounded by the community and locations that helped inspire it.

 Following the screening, guests are invited to stay for a special panel and Q&A with Greco and several members of the original crew who also call Hollywood home, including Elaine Kooser and Brian Moon. The conversation will offer a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the film, which took place during Hurricane Wilma, and what it meant to bring this powerful story to life in their hometown.

 “We are thrilled to welcome Joseph Greco home and celebrate both his artistic achievements and the City’s 100th anniversary,” said Andy Ruffner, Executive Director of Hollywood Historical Society. “Canvas showcases the beauty, heart, and character of Hollywood, and we know residents will take pride in seeing our city reflected on the big screen.”
