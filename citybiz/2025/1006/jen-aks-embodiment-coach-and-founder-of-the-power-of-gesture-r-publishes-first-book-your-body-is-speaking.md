# Jen Aks, Embodiment Coach and Founder of the Power of Gesture® Publishes First Book: Your Body Is Speaking

Jen Aks, embodiment coach, thought leader, author, and creator of The Power of Gesture®—a pioneering bodyset practice redefining leadership, decision-making, and confidence in today’s high-pressure world, is thrilled to announce that her debut book Your Body is Speaking is available today, September 30th.

 With over 30 years of experience as a dance educator and somatic practitioner, Jen has developed a signature method that bridges kinesthetic intelligence, emotional awareness, and embodiment-based leadership. Through intentional hand gestures, The Power of Gesture® delivers rapid shifts in self-trust, grounding, and presence—empowering leaders, professionals, and changemakers to lead authentically without second-guessing.

 “Mindset is only half of our intelligence. Bodyset is the missing piece,” says Jen Aks. “When we connect to how we feel, we unlock the clarity, confidence, and truth we’ve been searching for which allows us to lead authentically in all aspects of our life. And now, I’m thrilled to be spreading this important philosophy and approach throughout the world, changing more lives, with Your Body is Speaking.”

 Jen’s philosophy is anchored in the 3E Framework: Embody. Empower. Elevate. This approach helps people reconnect with their body’s wisdom, gain the courage to trust what they know, and show up authentically in their relationships, work, and life. When we embody first and realign with our core values, we can then feel authentically empowered and serve from our elevated state. Jen’s highly anticipated debut book captures her life’s work and offers readers a practical guide to:

 * Trust the body’s innate intelligence through The Power of Gesture®
* Communicate desires and vision with confidence
* Navigate life transitions with resilience and ease
* Lead with authentic presence in relationships, work, and community

 Adding to the momentum, Jen recently took the TEDx stage in Folsom, CA this past August, where she challenged conventional notions of leadership and revealed how the mind-body connection holds the key to stronger, more authentic decision-making.
