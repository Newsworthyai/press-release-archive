# The Cost of Short-Term Building: Why Construction Needs a Resilient Reset

Construction has always been seen as an investment in the future. But in reality, a lot of the industry has been shaped by short timelines and tight budgets—getting projects done fast and at the right price. That approach has made sense in many contexts. But now, we’re starting to see the limits of it—especially as long-term challenges grow harder to ignore.

 Energy systems are under strain. Insurance carriers are reassessing their exposure. And the cost of maintaining buildings that weren’t designed with future conditions in mind is starting to add up.

 The landscape is shifting—and the way we build has to shift with it.

 The Old Playbook Isn’t Holding Up

 For decades, we built with the assumption that energy would always be cheap, land would always be plentiful, and insurance would always cover the risk. But that’s no longer true.

 In places like Phoenix or Miami—cities that have seen tremendous growth—air-conditioning made large-scale development feasible. But many of those buildings weren’t designed to fit the local climate—they were designed to work around it. As a result, we’re now seeing rising costs tied to energy use and infrastructure strain.

 The problem isn’t a lack of better materials or smarter systems—we already have them. Carbon-capturing concrete, bioengineered insulation, and passive cooling designs already exist. They don’t just reduce emissions; they reduce costs over time. Prefabricated modular construction slashes waste while cutting labor expenses. Smarter HVAC systems and adaptive windows lower energy bills.

 These are real options that save money over the life of a building—and in some cases, even upfront.

 So why aren’t they standard yet?

 It Has to Pencil Out

 Builders make decisions based on what makes sense for the project—budgets, timelines, the expectations of owners and tenants. If a cheaper option meets code and keeps the schedule intact, it’s going to win.

 But that’s starting to change.

 Owners are asking for lower energy bills, longer-lasting materials, and buildings that hold their value over time. Some cities are rolling out carbon caps that add penalties for poor energy performance. And insurance companies are taking a harder look at properties in wildfire zones, floodplains, and extreme heat corridors—sometimes declining coverage altogether.

 All of that puts pressure on the current model. And it’s making resilience a financial issue, not just a design one.

 Policy as a Catalyst, Not a Burden

 Plenty of firms are already making changes—testing new materials, rethinking energy strategies, and planning for long-term durability. But without stronger codes and policies, it’s hard to scale those practices across the board.

 We’ve seen before how regulation can push the industry forward. Lead paint was phased out through policy. Fire codes didn’t improve because they were optional.

 In a similar way, cities and states have an opportunity now to raise the floor on performance standards—to make things like passive design or water-saving systems part of the baseline, not the bonus round.

 Where It Goes From Here

 There’s no need to overcomplicate this. A building that lasts longer, costs less to run, and stands up to climate extremes is better for everyone involved.

 Firms exploring these approaches today—whether through materials, planning, or partnerships—are already seeing the benefits. They’re reducing long-term costs. They’re standing out in competitive bids. And they’re building projects that will still make sense 10, 20, or 30 years from now.

 We don’t have to do anything radically different. It’s about adjusting the plan so that we’re not caught off guard down the road.

 The tools are already here. The opportunity is to use them—before rising costs and stricter rules make the decision for us.
