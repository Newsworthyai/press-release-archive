 “Most of us can remember our first bike and that feeling of independence and joy that comes with it. We bring that moment to kids in our community with Rick Case Bikes for Kids,” said Rita Case, President and CEO of the Rick Case Automotive Group. “What also makes it special is that for many of these kids, this is their first bike.
