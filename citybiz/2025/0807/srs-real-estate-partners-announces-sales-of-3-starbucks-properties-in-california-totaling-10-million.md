# SRS Real Estate Partners Announces Sales of 3 Starbucks Properties in California Totaling $10 Million

SRS Real Estate Partners announced today it has closed the sales of three Starbucks properties with a total value of $10 million. The properties include two Southern California/Inland Empire assets and one Northern California property. All the properties include drive-thrus, are new construction and have long-term, corporate-guaranteed triple-net leases in place.

 “SRS’s Capital Markets platform has continued to find success for Starbucks-leased property while current on-market Starbucks inventory remains high in California and nationally,” said Alexander Moore, a Vice President with SRS Capital Markets. “Starbucks assets are attracting interest from single-tenant net lease investors because they offer a favorable combination of strong corporate credit, long-term leases, and high-traffic locations that drive consistent sales.”

 SRS has been one of the leading brokerages for Starbucks property sales nationwide. In the past 12 months, SRS has transacted 39 Starbucks-occupied properties with the total value exceeding $126 million.

 Following is information on each Starbucks-occupied asset:
