# Greenhouse Software Appoints Sagar Patel as Chief Technology Officer

Greenhouse, the leading hiring platform, announced the appointment of its new Chief Technology Officer, Sagar Patel, who has extensive engineering leadership experience spanning companies including Ampla, PayPal, and BlackRock. Sagar joins Greenhouse during a period of growth acceleration, marked by recent launches such as Real Talent, MyGreenhouse, and Dream Jobs. His proven experience in leading technical teams will support Greenhouse as it accelerates AI adoption and brings new hiring products to market.

 Throughout his career, Sagar has demonstrated exceptional leadership, managing rapid team growth and complex product launches, while consistently increasing business value. Most recently, as the Head of Engineering for revolving credit products at PayPal, Sagar led the engineering team in developing high-volume credit and payment products used across a global customer base. As the Chief Technology Officer at Ampla, he introduced banking services and various credit products to the market. In his early career, he effectively scaled teams at BlackRock and Lunchbox.

 “Hiring technical talent is never easy. The only times I’ve felt confident during the recruitment process were when I was a hiring manager using the Greenhouse platform,” said Patel. “Now that I’ve joined Greenhouse as CTO, I’m looking forward to working on products that solve the recruitment problems that I’ve faced personally, at a company I believe in.”

 In his role at Greenhouse, Sagar looks forward to the opportunity to understand how the Greenhouse platform is adapting to a dynamic AI landscape and building product solutions that leverage agentic AI software to make recruiting easier. Together with Chief Product Officer Meredith Johnson, they are focused on restructuring the product development lifecycle to anticipate the evolving hiring needs of hiring teams and tomorrow’s workforce.

 “Sagar’s sharp approach to technology is exactly what we want at Greenhouse as we continue to develop software that balances AI technology advances with human decision-making,” said Daniel Chait, Co-founder and CEO of Greenhouse. “This is an exciting time of growth for Greenhouse as we’re launching new products, expanding globally, and onboarding larger customers. Sagar’s leadership will help drive our mission and goals forward.”

 Outside of work, Sagar enjoys golfing, running, hiking, and spending quality time with his two daughters. More often than not, though, you’ll find him coding or exploring the latest in technology.
