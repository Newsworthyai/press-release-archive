# Edge House Miami Partners with YUPIX to Launch Immersive Meta-Reality™ Sales Experience

Grupo T&C, the visionary developer behind the highly anticipated Edge House Miami, announces a strategic partnership with YUPIX, the revolutionary immersive technology company transforming the way buyers experience luxury real estate. Through this collaboration, Edge House will integrate YUPIX’s custom Meta-Reality platform, offering buyers an unprecedented virtual experience that brings the future residences and lifestyle of Edge House Miami to life.

 Located in the heart of Edgewater, Edge House Miami is a 57-story tower designed by renowned architect Kobi Karp, featuring 608 fully furnished, turnkey residences approved for flexible ownership–offering lockout floorplans that allow owners to rent out private suites separately. With contemporary, fully finished and furnished interiors curated by Adriana Hoyos Design Studio, extensive amenity offerings, and prime location near Miami’s cultural and business districts, the project caters to global buyers seeking elevated living and investment potential.

 “Edge House Miami has always been about redefining the way people live, invest, and experience real estate,” said William Ticona, CEO of Grupo T&C. “By partnering with YUPIX, we are enhancing the emotional and sensory dimensions of the buyer journey—allowing clients to connect with our vision in a powerful way.”

 YUPIX’s state-of-the-art platform creates a hyper-realistic, sensory-rich digital environment that allows prospective buyers to explore Edge House Miami’s unbuilt spaces as if they were physically there—capturing everything from sweeping sunset views to the refined details and finishes inside each residence. Through this immersive experience, users can virtually walk through the property, interact with the environment, and engage in real-time personalization—all without the limitations of physical distance or time.

 “At YUPIX, our mission is to create intuitive and emotionally compelling connections between people and place,” said Patricio Navarro, Founding Partner and CEO of YUPIX. “Edge House is a development with personality, purpose, and international appeal—and our technology brings that story to life with beauty and impact.”

 Users will also be able to explore Edge House Miami’s amenities and common areas firsthand—walking through the lobby and café-bar, soaking in panoramic views from the private sky lounge, taking a dip in the dual resort-style pools, meditating on the yoga lawn, or discovering the co-working spaces, wellness center, and podcast studio. This next-generation platform will debut at the Edge House Miami sales gallery and be available globally, giving buyers around the world the chance to fully immerse themselves in the Edge House lifestyle, without ever setting foot in Miami.

 Edge House Miami is exclusively represented by Douglas Elliman Development Marketing, with pricing starting in the $490,000s. For more information or to schedule a YUPIX virtual tour, visit EdgeHouseMiami.com.
