# MountainOne Participates in Central Berkshire Habitat for Humanity’s Women Build

An all-female team of Mountaineers from MountainOne rolled up their sleeves to support Women Build, a volunteer initiative led by Central Berkshire Habitat for Humanity. The program empowers women to take an active role in construction while advancing the mission of affordable housing in the Berkshires.

 MountainOne proudly sponsored the event and contributed a hands-on team effort in Pittsfield, where two new condominium units are taking shape. The all-women crew from MountainOne included Julie Rider, Shannon Dozier, Stacy Roman, Debra Bishop, Brenda Petell, Heidi Gingras, Jeanne Zatorski, Jennifer Smith, Samantha Leskovitz, and Renae Gamari.

 Together, the group helped install decking and siding on the homes. The day’s work not only strengthened the local housing landscape but also reinforced MountainOne’s ongoing commitment to giving back to the communities it serves.

 Brenda Petell, MountainOne’s Community Engagement Officer and a Central Berkshire Habitat for Humanity board member, reflected on the experience:

 “Today was about showing up and working side by side to help create something lasting for families in our community. It’s powerful to be part of a team that not only supports this work financially but also shows up to do the work together. I’m proud to be a part of both organizations.”
