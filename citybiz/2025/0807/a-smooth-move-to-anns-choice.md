# A Smooth Move to Ann’s Choice

By Julia Collins

 When Jane and Michael Doyle started preparing for their move to Ann’s Choice, an Erickson Senior Living community in Bucks County, Pa., their first step was clear–reach out to Planning and Moving Consultant Lisa Sicilia.

 The couple had a lot of questions about their “many possessions”–what to take and what to discard or donate, recalls Jane, noting that they were moving from a two-bedroom townhouse with a full basement.

 “Lisa was extremely helpful,” says Jane. “She advised us on what furniture we could bring.”

 Priority List perks

 Jane and Michael enjoyed a range of benefits as Priority List members, including first choice of available residences and invitations to exclusive informational events.

 But for them, access to personalized planning and moving support was the most impactful one by far.

 As they found, Sicilia offers far more than just sage advice.

 “I can help create a layout with your furniture, recommend preferred vendors, and coordinate services that you choose,” she explains. “For those who have lived in their houses for several years and don’t know where to begin, these resources offer real peace of mind. I’m here to make your move as easy and stress-free as possible!”

 Personalized support

 Sicilia’s support for incoming residents also includes complimentary home visits.

 “Some people are moving from townhouses and others are moving from large single-family homes,” Sicilia explains. “That’s why a home visit is so important. By discussing the goals for your new living space and all the furniture you’d like to bring, we achieve a better understanding of what resources are needed.”

 She continues, “Just simply talking through the process, one step at a time, helps too.”

 Jane, who was initially overwhelmed at the thought of moving, agrees. “We were able to make all the decisions rather than rely on our children, which felt good. Lisa was a big help.”

 During her visit with the Doyles, Sicilia took measurements and created a detailed floor plan showing how their furniture would fit in their desired Ann’s Choice residence.

 “Creating the floor plan gives a true sense of what their furnishings will look like in their new home,” notes Sicilia. “It also makes decluttering that much easier.”

 Jane adds, “It was useful for the movers as well.”

 Trusted partners

 Lisa also connects Priority List members with a network of trusted professionals, from real estate agents and downsizing specialists to moving companies and interior design vendors.

 “All of our preferred vendors have been vetted for quality service,” she explains. “The real estate agents specialize in different regions, so they can help make a plan for a quick home sale based on where you live.”

 “We used one of the moving companies Lisa recommended, which was excellent,” says Jane. “She also advised us quite a bit on companies and charities we could donate [our items] to.”

 And if residents choose to personalize their home before moving in, Sicilia coordinates those services as well.

 “I work closely with residents when they’re choosing finishes like countertops, cabinets, paint colors, and flooring,” she says. “Then, I connect them with vendors who specialize in custom closets, lighting, window treatments–whatever they’re looking for.”

 Jane and Michael decided to add built-ins to their closets to make the most of their space. “The built-ins really worked out well,” Jane says.

 Full steam ahead

 Since their move, the Doyles have been living life to the fullest at Ann’s Choice.

 “The first thing is socialization–going to the dining room every night and meeting new people,” Jane says. “I go to gentle yoga and tai chi, and together, we attend lectures.”

 She continues, “I’ve always been a walker, but I’m walking a lot more here–inside in the winter and outside now, exploring the grounds. When you’re out walking, everyone says hello or good morning. It’s really nice.”

 Sicilia encourages anyone considering this vibrant lifestyle at Ann’s Choice to start planning now.

 “It’s never too soon to create a plan or start downsizing, especially for folks who have lived in their house for 20 or 30 years,” she says. “And I’ll be there to help every step of the way! Together, we’ll make sure you experience a seamless move.”
