# Go Fund Yourself Season 3 Opens with High-Impact Innovation from Flexicon and Pathogenix.ai

Season 3 of Go Fund Yourself officially launched this week on Cheddar TV, drawing renewed attention from investors and industry watchers alike. The show—designed as a national stage for innovative early-stage ventures—continues to bridge the gap between capital and creativity, offering founders a high-profile platform to pitch in front of top-tier business leaders.

 Airing Thursdays at 7 PM ET, Go Fund Yourself features two founders each week who pitch live to a panel of “Titans”—veteran entrepreneurs and investors including Rory Cutaia (tech founder and creator of the show), Jayson Waller (Inc. 5000 CEO and business media personality), and David Meltzer (author, coach, investor, Chairman of the Napoleon Hill Institute). For entrepreneurs, this exposure has become a launchpad not only for funding—but also strategic partnerships, market traction, and national visibility.

 The Season 3 premiere spotlighted two compelling companies poised for significant growth in their respective sectors: Flexicon, a smart and disruptive fitness system, and Pathogenix.ai, an air quality intelligence company.

 

 Flexicon: Redefining Home Fitness for the Modern Market

 Flexicon enters a highly competitive fitness industry with a differentiated value proposition: resistance-based strength training without heavy weights or joint strain. Founder Blake Kassel has engineered a steel tower system that enables hundreds of exercises through precision resistance bands—offering users a professional-grade workout experience at home.

 Designed with functionality, compactness, and user experience in mind, the Flexicon system caters to consumers seeking effective workouts without the noise or space requirements of traditional equipment. The growing demand for smarter, space-saving fitness solutions—combined with Flexicon’s early customer traction—positions the company well in a market projected to surpass $20 billion globally.

 During his pitch, Kassel showcased the product’s unique engineering and highlighted early revenue numbers, customer testimonials, and the company’s roadmap for scaling production and distribution.

 Pathogenix.ai: Making Indoor Air Quality Actionable

 As awareness of environmental health continues to climb, Pathogenix.ai is tackling the challenge head-on with real-time airborne pathogen detection. The company’s flagship device uses artificial intelligence to detect viruses, bacteria, and chemical contaminants in indoor air—and does so in under five minutes.

 Founder Eugenie Addison demonstrated how the technology not only tracks air quality in real time but also eliminates 99.9% of harmful particles through built-in purification protocols. With applications spanning residential, educational, commercial, and healthcare environments, the device is poised to play a role in both consumer safety and public infrastructure.

 Addison’s presentation focused on both the urgency of the problem and the scalability of the solution. As smart building technology and wellness-oriented design gain ground, Pathogenix.ai is strategically positioned to lead the air monitoring category.

 A Platform That Translates Pitches Into Partnerships

 While Go Fund Yourself is entertaining television, its impact is grounded in real-world outcomes. The show’s format not only connects founders with investors but also offers strategic mentorship from the show’s Titans—who draw from decades of experience in tech, business development, and brand building.

 The program reaches over 500,000 viewers each week, providing startups with media exposure that can translate into sales, strategic alliances, and long-term funding opportunities. As one viewer noted on social media, “This isn’t just a pitch—it’s a business breakthrough waiting to happen.”
