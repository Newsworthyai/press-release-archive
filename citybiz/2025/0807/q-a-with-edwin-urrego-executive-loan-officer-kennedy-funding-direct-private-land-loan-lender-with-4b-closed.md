 In this Q&A, Edwin shares how Kennedy Funding built its reputation, what types of deals they focus on, and how their hands-on, fast-moving approach gives borrowers an edge—especially when every day counts.

 For those unfamiliar, how would you describe Kennedy Funding and what sets it apart?

 Kennedy Funding is a direct private lender focused on delivering capital fast—especially when time is critical. We specialize in real estate-secured loans for acquisitions, construction, refinance, and cash-outs, with a reputation for stepping in when banks and traditional lenders can’t or won’t. Because we’re direct lenders, there’s no red tape—no committees, no waiting around. We can issue commitments in as little as two days, and we’ve closed loans from $1 million to over $50 million in just a matter of days.

 Even in today’s uncertain environment, we continue to fund deals others walk away from—particularly land acquisitions and development opportunities where speed and flexibility are everything.

 What sets us apart isn’t just the capital—it’s the certainty. Whether it’s raw land in New York or a mixed-use project in the Dominican Republic, our team has the experience and international reach to create a custom solution fast.

 What’s the company’s typical loan size and borrower profile?

 Our sweet spot is between $1 million ($3 million internationally) and $50 million, but we’ve gone higher. Borrowers come to us when time is tight, or the property type isn’t favored by conventional lenders. We work with developers, investors, and brokers who need a partner that can move fast and think creatively.

 What types of properties do you lend on most often?

 Land, multifamily, retail, industrial, hospitality—we fund it all. But what truly sets us apart is our ability to lend on raw or entitled land, which most lenders avoid. For example, we recently closed a $4+ million loan for a property in Mejía, Ecuador. It’s the kind of international land deal that many institutions wouldn’t even consider—but we got it done, and we got it done fast.

 Why are raw land deals so difficult for traditional lenders?

 Because they’re considered high risk. Raw land doesn’t produce income, and most banks won’t take on that kind of uncertainty. At Kennedy Funding, we take a different view. We look at the value of the collateral – whether it be raw, undeveloped land or a completed property.

 What’s Kennedy’s biggest competitive advantage?

 Certainty of execution. A lot of lenders say they can close fast—but we actually do it. We’ve funded loans in as little as five days. That’s possible because we’re direct lenders with our own capital and a deep understanding of real estate. When other lenders are still asking for committee meetings, we’re issuing term sheets.

 Can you talk about your international reach?

 Absolutely. We’ve funded deals throughout the Caribbean, Canada, and Central and South America. Many lenders won’t touch cross-border transactions because of legal complexities and title issues. But at Kennedy, we focus on what matters most—the value of the real estate collateral. We know how to evaluate property in different markets and secure it properly. I’ve personally worked on several successful deals in Spanish-speaking countries, where I’ve helped clients navigate both the process and the language.

 How has the current economic climate affected private lending?

 Uncertainty has made private lending even more essential. As banks and conventional lenders pull back, borrowers still need capital—especially to seize opportunities in land development or repositioning distressed assets. Our phone is ringing more than ever because we can step in where others have stepped out.

 What’s one example of Kennedy’s ability to solve a problem quickly?

 One standout case is Kennedy Funding’s $5.1 million land acquisition loan for a borrower in Chesapeake City, Maryland. Traditional lenders had balked due to the raw land’s undeveloped status and associated entitlement hurdles. Kennedy Funding evaluated the land’s intrinsic value and growth potential, swiftly structured the financing, and closed the loan—providing the borrower the capital needed to move forward with development plans. This deal exemplifies Kennedy’s ability to step in where others won’t and get the job done fast.

 What are some of the requirements a borrower needs to get funded fast?

 A well-organized submission is key. We look for items such as, but not limited to a clean title, a clean Phase I environmental report (dated within 6 months), and an independent appraisal. Having those items ready up front allows us to evaluate the deal efficiently and move forward without unnecessary delays.

 What’s one misconception about private lending that you often hear?

 That it’s a last resort. In reality, private capital can be a strategic choice. Many of our clients use us as an intentional bridge to bigger things—acquisition, working capital, stabilization, or a construction start. The smartest borrowers understand that speed and flexibility can unlock value others miss.

 How does Kennedy Funding build long-term relationships?

 We don’t just close loans—we help borrowers succeed. We’ve had borrowers come back again and again as their projects progress. They know we’ll be honest, responsive, and committed to helping them move forward, even when the path isn’t straight.
