# Keystone Announces Formation of Gillson Sciences

CHICAGO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Keystone Capital Management, is pleased to announce the formation of Gillson Sciences, a provider of laboratory testing, monitoring and advisory solutions that deliver quality, compliance, and regulatory excellence to clients. The Company empowers clients with science-driven support to develop, source, manufacture, and commercialize safe and effective products.

 With deep expertise across pharmaceuticals, biopharma, medical devices, healthcare and environmental sciences, the Company partners with clients to address a broad range of human health challenges. The services are required by various regulatory bodies and are considered mission-critical, enabling clients to maintain operations and meet stringent compliance demands.

 Based in Chicago, Illinois, Gillson was formed in January 2025 through the acquisitions of Azzur Labs (now known as “Gillson Testing”) and Micro Measurement Laboratories (“MML”). By uniting two experts in their respective fields, Gillson has the capabilities to deliver more comprehensive, integrated scientific solutions that address clients’ complex challenges across their development phases. Gillson operates laboratories in Pennsylvania, Illinois and California with field personnel across the U.S.

 Keystone has partnered with Jason Fischer to oversee the build-up strategy as CEO of Gillson Sciences. Prior to joining Gillson Sciences, Mr. Fischer worked at UL Solutions (NYSE: ULS) for 13 years, where he served on the leadership team in a variety of positions, including President of Enterprise & Advisory Services, Senior Vice President of the Field Engineering Group, President of the Asia Region and Global Vice President of Corporate Development. In his role as Global Vice President of Corporate Development, Mr. Fischer led the expansion of UL Solutions’ service portfolio through strategic partnerships and 40+ acquisitions to build multiple operating platforms within the company. Mr. Fischer is responsible for the leadership and management of Gillson Sciences.

 “I am excited to partner with Keystone to form Gillson Sciences,” said Jason Fischer. “Gillson Sciences represents the opportunity to build a market leader in testing, monitoring, and advisory solutions focused on advancing human health. We have a great foundation with our outstanding employees and clients, a motivating mission and the right partners to deliver on our plan. I am looking forward to building and growing our business in the years to come.”

 “We are delighted to partner with Jason and the entire Gillson team, whose deep industry expertise and proven track record make them the ideal leaders to execute our shared vision for the platform,” commented Todd Lanscioni, Managing Director at Keystone Capital.

 Gillson continues to explore high-quality opportunities to expand its capabilities and reach within the testing, inspection, certification and compliance (“TICC”) sector. The Company remains committed to partnering with organizations that share its mission of advancing quality, safety, and regulatory excellence across critical end markets.

 Terms of the transaction are not being disclosed. Legal counsel was provided by Dentons LLP.
