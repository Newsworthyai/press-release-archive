# Comunidad Partners Expands South Carolina Presence With Acquisition of 234-Unit Garden-Style Multifamily; Plans To Drive Long-Term Value Throughout Portfolio

Comunidad Partners, a vertically-integrated real estate investment firm that specializes in workforce and attainable housing communities in diverse neighborhoods throughout the Sunbelt region, has acquired The Haywood, a 234-unit workforce housing property situated in Greenville, South Carolina.

 The latest multifamily addition to the firm’s South Carolina portfolio is part of Comunidad’s mission to provide workforce and attainable housing for residents in high demand markets and deliver risk-adjusted returns for impact investors, according to Antonio Marquez, Principal and Managing Partner at Comunidad Partners.

 “Greenville is a growing metro with strong fundamentals, and there is a vital need for attainable housing that can serve essential workers and support the local economy,” says Marquez. “We are excited to add this community to our Sunbelt portfolio, which will allow us to implement our unique, value-add strategy and provide quality housing for local residents.”

 Ty Barnes, Head of Investments at Comunidad Partners, notes that Greenville is a supply constrained market that is poised for significant rent growth. Furthermore, with an A-rated school district, robust population growth, and impressive local household incomes ($104K average within a three-mile radius), the market’s immediate and long term fundamentals are compelling.

 “Over the last few years, South Carolina has outpaced job growth at the national level,” says Barnes. “Given that Greenville is one of the largest metros in the state, home to top employers such as BMW and GE Power, this is a prime location that can benefit from a Sunbelt-focused workforce housing owner and operator like Comunidad. Although living in South Carolina is more affordable compared to other states, homeownership for moderate-income earners living in Greenville, including teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers, is still unattainable for much of the population. This has created a shortage of workforce housing in the area, causing significant pressure on essential workers and contributing to longer commute times overall.”

 The firm plans to allocate significant capital to enhance the resident experience at the Haywood as part of its value-add investment strategy. Slated renovations include interior unit upgrades, curb appeal, and family-friendly amenities. Additionally, Comunidad is planning to work closely with local and national non-profit partners to create beneficial resident services and maintain regulatory compliance at the portfolio level. This aligns with the firm’s social impact efforts to create a community benefit and a positive impact on resident well-being. In 2024, Comunidad reported a 92% needs resolution rate across its portfolio’s community programs, highlighting the strength of meeting residents’ needs through customized programming as opposed to using a “one size fits all” approach.

 Keaton Graham, Director of Impact at Comunidad says: “Through our experienced ownership and management teams, we will implement specific renovations and programs that best serve residents in the community and align with our mission to enrich lives while generating returns for our investors. Our strategies have created a positive impact on residents’ lives across our portfolio and delivered strong investment returns simultaneously. By improving the overall property NOI, we can continue to invest in resident programming and help increase resident household income, decrease household cost burdens, and improve resident household wealth/equity—leading to long-term value and stability. We are the example that preserving attainable housing and providing compelling returns for our investors is possible.”

 The Haywood is conveniently situated near highly rated public K-12 schools; transportation hubs such as Greenville Downtown Airport, Greenville Spartanburg International Airport and Interstate 85; and various healthcare centers and recreational parks and social amenities.

 The property is located at 100 Gloucester Ferry Road in Greenville, South Carolina.
