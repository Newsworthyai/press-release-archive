 Meet the Local Owners

 Play It Again Sports East Ridge is locally owned and operated by longtime Chattanooga residents Tim and Bri Watkins. Wanting a business that aligned with their values of family, sustainability and community, the couple turned to Play It Again Sports. With 3,750 sq. ft. of space, the store will serve athletes of all ages, making fitness and athletics more affordable.

 “Sports and fitness should be available to everyone—not just those who can afford brand-new gear,” said Tim Watkins. “By buying and selling used equipment, we’re not only making sports more accessible and affordable, but also helping reduce waste and support a healthier, more active community.”
