# Qualys Launches First Agentic AI-Driven Risk Operations Center for Autonomous Risk Management

Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ: QLYS), a leading provider of disruptive cloud-based IT, security and compliance solutions, today unveiled several new Agentic AI capabilities on the Qualys platform. The new AI fabric introduces a marketplace of Cyber Risk AI Agents delivering real-time risk insights across all attack surfaces, prioritized by business impact. Additionally, it reduces risk and operational costs by autonomously remediating with speed, scale, and accuracy, all while powering a smarter, more efficient Risk Operations Center (ROC).

 Amid a surge in the volume and sophistication of cyber threats, amplified by the growing complexity of an ever-evolving attack surface, teams are grappling with millions of exposures while lacking the context to map them against business priorities. Without self-orchestrating AI agents to turn data into insights, and prioritize and remediate risks in real time, security teams face manual bottlenecks and lingering exposures. Qualys addresses this with Agentic AI—eliminating repetitive tasks and enabling autonomous, risk-focused workflows that empower teams and accelerate protection.

 “Cybersecurity has never been able to keep pace with the volume of enterprise exposures due to human-scale prioritization and remediation,” said Tyler Shields, principal analyst at Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG). “Integrating Agentic AI into the Qualys platform marks a major leap—from reactive response to real-time risk reduction. With autonomous remediation and intelligent prioritization, this type of innovation enables faster risk reduction, more efficient resource usage, and greater accuracy in recommended actions. This evolution shifts security teams from tactical responders to strategic agentic AI orchestrators, bringing us closer to a future of self-healing cybersecurity.”

 By embedding Agentic AI into Enterprise TruRisk Management (ETM), Qualys enhances its risk-centric automation capabilities—delivering faster, more intelligent decision-making. Already a leading cornerstone of the ROC, ETM aggregates exposures to measure, communicate, and eliminate cyber risk aligned to business value. Now, with the new AI fabric, Qualys delivers pre-built AI agents that automate threat prioritization and drive remediation strategies tailored to each organization’s risk appetite and environment. It also introduces the Cyber Risk Assistant—a prompt-driven interface that helps teams navigate the risk journey, translate millions of exposures, and deliver context-aware risk insights with autonomous operations.

 The Qualys Marketplace of ready-to-use AI agents delivers:

 Continuous Risk Insights and Prioritization from Fragmented Exposures – Pre-built AI agents autonomously and adaptively drive every step of the cyber risk journey from continuously discovering your external attack surface with a hacker’s-eye view, to proactively assessing risk against trending industry threats, and prioritizing those risks based on the context of your unique assets and environment. Thus, helping organizations reduce the cost and complexity of risk operations.

 Adaptive Remediation for the Highest Security Posture – With attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in under 18 days, cybersecurity and IT teams are focused on reducing mean time to remediation (MTTR). Adaptive Risk Remediation AI Agents like the Microsoft Patch Tuesday Lifecycle Agent continuously triangulate prioritized vulnerabilities, correlated remediation techniques, and asset context to drive faster, more transparent risk remediation. This reduces cost and time to close vulnerabilities.

 Build Your Own AI Agent – Security teams can create custom, no-code, pretrained AI agents tailored to their specific business needs. These agents can be trained to perform specialized tasks autonomously and reused as needed—enabling scalable, repeatable automation for risk management workflows unique to each organization.

 “Qualys Agentic AI, embedded into Enterprise TruRisk Management is transforming how organizations manage cyber risk and powering a smarter, more agile Risk Operations Center,” said Sumedh Thakar, president and CEO of Qualys. “It’s ushering in a new era where CISOs can augment their security teams with intelligent AI agents that perform autonomous analysis and take decisive, high-impact actions to reduce risk faster, more strategically, and with greater efficiency.”
