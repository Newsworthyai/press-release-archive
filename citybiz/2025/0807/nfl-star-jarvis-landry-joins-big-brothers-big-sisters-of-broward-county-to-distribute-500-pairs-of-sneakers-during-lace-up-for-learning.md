# NFL Star Jarvis Landry Joins Big Brothers Big Sisters of Broward County to Distribute 500+ Pairs of Sneakers During “Lace Up for Learning”

Hundreds of smiling faces lit up Snyder Park in Fort Lauderdale as more than 500 Littles with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Broward County received brand-new sneakers in advance of the new school year during the organization’s annual Lace Up for Learning picnic and field day.

 The Littles were treated to a special appearance by five-time Pro Bowler, NFL star and former Miami Dolphin, Jarvis Landry, whose foundation, The Impact Group Project, generously sponsored the hydration station and supported the sneaker giveaway. Landry greeted families, posed for photos and helped distribute the new sneakers, bringing joy and inspiration to all in attendance.

 “Starting school with a new pair of shoes will do wonders for a child’s self-esteem,” said Landry. “I’m proud to support Big Brothers Big Sisters of Broward County and help these kids start the school year on the right foot — literally.”
