# Local Park Cities Husband-and-Wife Duo to Debut New D1 Training Studio in Midway Hollow

D1 Training, a leading fitness enrichment concept utilizing the five core tenets of athletic-based training, will be opening a new location in Park Cities at 10031 Marsh Ln #320 on August 9. The new group fitness facility employs a sports-science backed training regimen led by certified trainers to help people of all ages achieve their sport and fitness goals.

 Kendrick and Aron Leckband will join a roster of impressive existing franchisees, including professional athletes like Kylie Fitts and Jordan Gay. Additional D1 partners include NBA star Chris Paul and Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow.

 Growing up, both Kendrick and Aron were passionate about athletics. Kendrick, born and raised in the Park Cities, played competitive soccer and helped lead the Highland Park girls varsity team to a state championship. She was also a HPHS cheerleader for 15 years. Aron stayed active in a range of sports throughout his youth, which sparked his interest in health, fitness, and performance.

 Now raising four kids who train with private coaches and compete regularly, the Leckbands understand the demands of youth athletics. They saw a clear need in the Park Cities, Preston Hollow, and Midway Hollow areas for a facility that offers expert-level training tailored to young athletes. That’s what made D1 Training such a natural fit for their values and vision.

 To Kendrick and Aron, this isn’t just a business, it’s a passion project. It gives them the chance to support local families and help young athletes grow stronger, more confident, and better prepared to chase their dreams.

 “Having grown up deeply involved in sports ourselves, we know firsthand the dedication and support young athletes need to succeed,” said Kendrick. “With four active kids of our own, we recognize how important it is to have access to expert training close to home. Opening D1 Training close to home allows us to give back to our community by helping youth build strength, confidence, and the skills necessary to reach their full potential both on and off the field.”

 After the recent closing of D1 Training Dallas, members wasted no time heading to the brand new Midway Hollow location to continue their fitness journeys. General Manager Kevin Engelbrecht, formerly of the Dallas facility, is bringing his energy and experienced team along with him. For Kevin and his staff, it’s a chance to keep working with familiar faces while welcoming new youth and adult athletes from across the area.

 D1 Training offers four age-based programs including Rookie (ages 7-11), Developmental (ages 12-14), Prep (ages 15-18) and D1 Adult. Each fitness program is based on the five athletic-based tenets: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down. Outside of group workouts, D1 Training offers group, semi-private, and one-on-one training with world-class coaches. The goal is simple: to continue to train athletes who are dedicated to their sport or fitness goals, regardless of age, or athletic background.

 “Kendrick and Aron are the ideal candidates to bring the D1 Training experience to Park Cities,” said the brand’s Chief Operating Officer, Dan Murphy. “We’re thrilled to welcome them to the D1 family and are confident in their ability to show the Park Cities, Preston Hollow, and Midway Hollow areas what they’ve been missing out on. D1 is a one-of-a-kind fitness experience that’s built around the individual and meant to help people meet their athletic goals. Our strong network of franchisees embodies our core values to bring the D1 Training vision to life, and we know Kendrick and Aron will do just that in Park Cities and its surrounding communities.”

 Strategically expanding across the nation through franchising, D1 Training has more than 100 performance centers open with over 100 additional locations in various stages of development. The brand is currently seeking financially qualified business builders, former athletes, and entrepreneurs, who share a passion for fitness and youth sports, who are ready to make a positive impact on their community.
