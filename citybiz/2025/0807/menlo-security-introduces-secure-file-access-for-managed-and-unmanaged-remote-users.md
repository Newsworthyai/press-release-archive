# Menlo Security Introduces Secure File Access for Managed and Unmanaged Remote Users

Menlo Security, the pioneer in browser security, today announced the launch of Menlo Secure Storage and Menlo Adaptive Web. These two powerful new offerings are designed to give organizations greater control over user experiences and sensitive data, all while ensuring files and interactions never touch the endpoint.

 With more than a decade of leadership in cloud-delivered browser security, Menlo Security is introducing new capabilities that directly address today’s remote work and data protection challenges. These advancements help organizations protect sensitive information without disrupting user workflows or relying on traditional, cumbersome endpoint solutions.

 Menlo Secure Storage for Zero-Trust File Collaboration

 In today’s hybrid work environment, employees, contractors, and partners work from anywhere using a mix of managed and unmanaged/bring your own devices (BYOD). These devices access corporate applications containing sensitive company data and files. However, downloading this sensitive data to endpoints poses a critical security risk. Endpoints, especially unmanaged or BYOD devices, cannot be inherently trusted as their security posture may not be verifiable. If a sensitive file is downloaded to a compromised or untrusted endpoint, there is a high risk for attackers to easily gain access to that file and its sensitive data.

 Menlo Secure Storage eliminates this risk by ensuring files and data are fully accessible to users but never saved locally to the user’s device. Whether a contractor is accessing confidential project files or an employee is moving documents between enterprise SaaS apps, all file interactions stay confined within the Menlo Secure Cloud environment.

 Key benefits include:

 * Allowing contractors and other unmanaged third parties to access and view sensitive documents without the data ever being downloaded to their local devices. This enhances security without hindering collaboration.
* Enabling employees to transfer files between secure corporate apps without risking endpoint exposure.
* Eliminating the need for legacy solutions like VDI to enforce data control, which can significantly reduce infrastructure and operational costs.

 “With Menlo Secure Storage, we’re solving a critical enterprise problem, which is enabling file-based collaboration in a zero-trust world,” said Devin Ertel, Chief Information Security Officer at Menlo Security. “By keeping sensitive files out of local environments entirely, organizations can confidently support hybrid work and third-party access, without increasing their risk surface.”

 Menlo Adaptive Web for Unparalleled Browser Control

 Menlo Adaptive Web is a first-of-its-kind suite of cloud-based browser controls that gives organizations fine-grained control over how users interact with web content. Delivered through Menlo’s cloud service, Menlo Adaptive Web allows organizations to deeply tailor their user’s web browsing experience. Some examples of what the modules can be used to achieve include:

 * Data Redaction
* Block Page with Redirect
* Coaching Page/Banner
* Disable Password Fields
* SafeSearch Enforcer

 These powerful modules can be customized to an organization’s exact needs and deployed to individual users or groups across any browser session. This gives IT and security teams unmatched flexibility and precision without compromising on user experience or operational efficiency. This list of capabilities is constantly evolving and can be easily applied to any customer cloud instance.

 As enterprises move deeper into hybrid and cloud-first environments, the browser has become a primary access point in cybersecurity. Together, Menlo Secure Storage and Menlo Adaptive Web are the next step in making the browser a secure, intelligent workspace that empowers users while keeping enterprises in control.

 Menlo Security is showcasing these new solutions, including findings from the company’s recent GenAI Report at Black Hat, currently taking place in Las Vegas. Attendees are invited to visit Menlo Security’s booth, #4708, for live demonstrations and to learn more about how Menlo Security is revolutionizing browser security.
