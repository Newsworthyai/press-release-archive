# Open Hand Returns with 22nd Annual Party in the Kitchen Fundraiser, Sept. 25

Celebrated chefs, curated bites and one powerful cause come together for Open Hand Atlanta’s signature fundraising event

 Open Hand invites supporters to the 22nd annual Party in the Kitchen on Thursday, Sept. 25, from 6:30 – 10:30 p.m. at The Foundry at Puritan Mill. One of Atlanta’s most anticipated culinary fundraisers, this dynamic evening will spotlight the city’s top chefs while raising vital funds to support Open Hand’s mission of building healthier communities through nutrition.

 The event will feature an impressive lineup of culinary talent, craft cocktails, chef-curated tastings, live and silent auctions and musical entertainment by The American Flyers. Returning renowned chefs Peter Kaiser and Kevin Rathbun will serve as chef co-chairs, joined by new event co-chairs Marc Castillo, Heather Froy and Victor Macias.

 “We’re incredibly grateful to have some of Atlanta’s most talented chefs come together once again in support of Open Hand’s mission,” said Open Hand CEO Matthew Pieper. “Their generosity and passion help fuel the vital work we do — delivering thousands of nourishing meals to the neighbors who need them most.”

 Guests will enjoy signature bites from celebrated chefs, including Terry Koval (The Deer and The Dove), Pat Pascarella (The Porchetta Group), Joseph Harrison (Aria) and Tyler Haake (Indaco), along with the opportunity to bid on exclusive auction packages—ranging from luxury getaways and private dinners to one-of-a-kind experiences and more.

 Prior to the main event, Open Hand will host a VIP Patron Reception on Thursday, Aug. 21, from 6:30 – 9:30 p.m. at its recently opened headquarters, the James A. Carlos Family Community Nutrition Center. Patron-level guests and sponsors will enjoy cocktails, light bites, the chance to bid on an exclusive live auction item and an opportunity to see first-hand how their contributions make an impact on their community.

 Proceeds from Party in the Kitchen directly support Open Hand’s programs, which provide medically tailored meals and nutrition education to individuals living with chronic or severe illness, food insecurity and social isolation across Georgia.

 Tickets to the Main Event are $300, while the Patron Reception Package (includes two tickets) starts at $2,000 and provides access to both events. Main Event ticket price increases to $350 after Aug. 25.
