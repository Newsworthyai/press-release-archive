# Zachary’s Jewelers Celebrates 20 Years at 100 Main Street with “Fire &amp; Ice” Event

Zachary’s Jewelers, a family-owned fine jeweler located in the heart of Downtown Annapolis, celebrated 20 years at its flagship location at 100 Main Street with a special “Fire & Ice” event on Saturday, Aug. 23. The event highlighted Zachary’s “Year of Gratitude,” honoring the community that helped the business reopen after a devastating fire in 2005 and has continued to support it ever since. Guests enjoyed live music, tastings from Seasons Olive Oil and special activations from Marco Bicego, including a trunk show and “Fire & Ice” themed lounge. The evening also featured the presentation of the inaugural Zachary’s Small Business Grant and a donation to The Friends of the Eastport Volunteer Fire Company.

 “From the very beginning, we knew Zachary’s had to be about more than jewelry; it had to be about being a part of the broader Annapolis community,” said Steve Samaras, owner of Zachary’s Jewelers. “When our original storefront burned down on Black Friday, just days after I had lost my father, a reporter asked what I would do for the holidays. For me, the answer was clear: jewelry and buildings can be replaced, but people cannot. What mattered most was the way our community rallied around us, helping us reopen in just seven days. That moment shaped not only my outlook on life, but also how we approach retail. Today, I’m proud that many of the people who stood by my side during that fire – Evangeline Ross, Errol Daly, Doug Mixer and Erica Cureton – are still part of our Zachary’s family and continue to carry forward our mission of bringing humanity to everything we do.”

 The “Fire & Ice” theme paid tribute to the five-alarm fire on Nov. 25, 2005, that destroyed Zachary’s original location and two neighboring buildings. Despite the loss, competitors offered temporary space, a local bank provided a vault to store jewelry and Zachary’s landlord closed his souvenir shop to house the jeweler – the location it still occupies today. One week later, Zachary’s reopened at 100 Main Street with a holiday party that drew more than 400 guests and marked the start of one of its strongest holiday seasons. To commemorate the anniversary, Zachary’s returned to the Eastport Fire Station for a photoshoot for its annual magazine and presented a donation to The Friends of the Eastport Volunteer Fire Company.

 As an extension of its “Year of Gratitude,” Zachary’s also launched its Small Business Grant program to honor and uplift local entrepreneurs making a meaningful difference. Nearly 50 local businesses applied for the $5,000 award, which recognizes a business that “brings humanity to retail” by investing in its people, serving its community and operating with empathy, intention and heart. This year’s recipient was Amanda Fisher, founder of ABF Coaching, a certified Executive and Leadership Coach who helps women in mission-driven roles lead with purpose and impact, leaving a mark on their teams, organizations and communities.

 Accepting the award, Fisher remarked, “After spending 20 years in the nonprofit space, I saw firsthand how women make up nearly 75% of the social impact workforce yet remain underrepresented in leadership. That’s something I want to change,” said Amanda Fisher, founder of ABF Coaching. “When I started my business, I dreamed of building something that would allow me to be present with my family while also giving back to the community in a meaningful way. This grant gives me the breathing room to continue creating opportunities for female leaders and to give back to the community in a wonderful way.”

 Today, Zachary’s is recognized not only for its fine collections and custom designs but also for the lasting impact it has made on the Annapolis community. Looking ahead, the jeweler will continue living out its mission of “bringing humanity to retail” by investing in local traditions, supporting small businesses and creating meaningful customer experiences.
