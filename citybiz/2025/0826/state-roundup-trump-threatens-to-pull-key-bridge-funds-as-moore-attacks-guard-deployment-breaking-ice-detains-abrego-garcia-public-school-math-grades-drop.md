# State Roundup: Trump Threatens To Pull Key Bridge Funds As Moore Attacks Guard Deployment; Breaking: ICE Detains Abrego Garcia; Public School Math Grades Drop

BREAKING: ICE DETAINS ABREGO GARCIA AT CHECK-IN: Kilmar Abrego García was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Monday after arriving at the agency’s Baltimore field office as part of a required check-in after his release pending trial on human smuggling charges, his attorney said. The detention comes three days after the undocumented immigrant was freed after a federal judge determined he did not pose a flight risk or danger to the community. Trump officials had insisted Abrego would “never go free” in the United States. Maria Sacchetti, Jeremy Roebuck and Dana Munro/The Washington Post. (See related articles below.)

 MOORE SLAMS TRUMP; TRUMP SUGGESTS PULLING FUNDS FROM KEY BRIDGE: President Donald Trump clapped back at Gov. Wes Moore on Sunday, threatening to “send in the troops” to Baltimore in a lengthy social media post. The outburst saw Trump mock Moore’s offer for him to “walk the streets” of Baltimore, suggest he could pull federal funding for the reconstruction of the Key Bridge, and imply that Moore lied about receiving a Bronze Star for his service in the Army. He received the honor this past winter. Carson Swick/The Baltimore Sun.

 * Moore said that President Trump’s military deployment in Washington, D.C., is “not sustainable” and “unconstitutional,” adding that he would not authorize deployment of National Guard troops from Maryland to D.C. Margaret Brennan/Face The Nation.
* Trump threatened Sunday morning to revisit the federal government’s decision to fully fund the Key Bridge replacement and to send the military to Baltimore. The threats, posted to Trump’s Truth Social platform, are a sharp escalation in the back-and-forth between the president and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore in recent weeks. Lee O. Sanderlin/The Baltimore Banner.
* Trump ended his missive by noting that “I gave Wes Moore a lot of money to fix his demolished bridge. I will now have to rethink that decision???” an apparent reference to a Congress-approved commitment to fully fund replacement for the Key Bridge after it was destroyed in a crash with a container ship last year. Staff/Maryland Matters.

 TRUMP COULD AGGRAVATE PROGRESS MADE IN B’MORE, ADVOCATES SAY: Advocates and officials discussed the task of police reform amid threats of a takeover by federal law enforcement at a town hall Saturday. The event, hosted by Baltimore’s Police Accountability Board and Office of Equity and Civil Rights, aimed to discuss the shift from reactive to proactive community policing and handling of behavioral health crises. But panelists were quick to point out that the Trump administration’s funding cuts and domineering may aggravate the challenges they face. Mathew Schumer/The Baltimore Sun.

 STATE FAILED TO ENFORCE MAJOR VIOLATIONS IN ADULT DAY CARES, FEDS SAY: Maryland officials failed to enforce major violations that put vulnerable people at risk inside adult day cares across the state, according to a federal audit that raises questions about the Maryland Health Department’s ability to regulate health care facilities. Katie Shepherd/The Washington Post.

 TRUMP CRUSADE AGAINST RENEWABLE ENERGY WEAKENS STATE OBJECTIVES: After four years of state and federal alignment on energy policy, Maryland is on defense against the Trump administration’s crusade against renewable energy projects in favor of fossil fuels. Executive actions and new laws are undermining the state’s plan for a clean energy future as Maryland faces growing demands on its electrical grid. Ben Mause/The Baltimore Sun.

 MATH GRADES FOR PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS DROP: From wealthy suburbs to rural hillsides, Maryland public school students on average aren’t great at math. It wasn’t always so. Back in 2009, Maryland’s eighth graders significantly outperformed the national average on the country’s most rigorous math test, called the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Liz Bowie/The Baltimore Banner.

 ****TRUMP ADMIN INTENDS TO DEPORT ABREGO GARCIA TO UGANDA: The Trump administration intends to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he rejected a last-minute deal to remain in jail, plead guilty to human smuggling charges and be deported to Costa Rica, a legal notice filed Saturday by his attorneys said. Anita Wadhwani/Maryland Matters.

 * ICE told Garcia to report to the Baltimore field office Monday morning as it plans to deport him to Uganda. The Salvadoran native and Beltsville resident, once wrongfully deported then returned to the U.S. to face criminal charges, was released from pretrial detention in Tennessee and allowed to return to his family in Maryland only Friday. Daniel Zawodny and John-John Williams IV/The Baltimore Banner.
* On Friday, Abrego Garcia, who was deported to El Salvador, returned home to Maryland, where he was greeted by his wife, son and family. Staff/Forbes.r, r
* CASA, a Maryland-based immigrant and Latino advocacy organization, has planned a rally and vigil in front of the ICE office at 6:30 a.m. this morning, where he is to check in, according to an announcement. Chevall Pryce/The Baltimore Sun. o
* Sen. Chris Van Hollen met virtually Sunday with Kilmar Abrego Garcia and his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura — less than 24 hours before the embattled Maryland father is set to check in with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials as it plans to deport him to Uganda. John-John Williams/The Baltimore Banner.

 ADVOCATES SAY NEW STORMWATER PERMIT MISSED THE MARK: A new stormwater permit meant to control runoff of polluted rainwater from state roads into state waterways is a “critical missed opportunity,” according to environmental groups, who say the new guidelines backtrack from previous requirements. The five-year permit sets a requirement of controlling runoff on more than 4,000 acres owned by State Highway Administration, which is backed up by $216 million in combined state and federal funding, officials said. Christine Condon/Maryland Matters.

 STATE LOTTERY CONTRACT UP IN THE AIR: A lucrative, decade-long contract to operate the Maryland Lottery is up in the air after state officials took an unusual step to award, then rescind the contract to an embattled multinational gaming company this summer. Sam Janesch/The Baltimore Sun.

 MOORE SAYS MARYLAND MUST REDRAW MAPS AFTER TRUMP’s TEXAS MOVE: Asked Sunday if he is considering a redraw of Maryland’s congressional districts, Gov. Wes Moore answered in the affirmative. “Yeah, and I think we have to,” Moore told CBS News anchor Margaret Brennan during his appearance on “Face The Nation” Sunday morning. Moore drew parallels between the GOP’s redistricting strategy and President Donald Trump’s call urging Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find 11,780 votes” to help overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. Carson Swick/The Baltimore Sun.

 MD FREEDOM CAUCUS: CALLING MOORE ‘GHETTO’ NOT RACIST: The Maryland Freedom Caucus is doubling down on a post it retweeted on X Thursday that called Gov. Wes Moore “ghetto,” saying they didn’t interpret it as racist. “That’s not how any of us received or thought about that tweet,” Caucus chair Matt Morgan, a Republican delegate from St. Mary’s County, said in an interview Friday. “If we felt like we did something wrong, we would apologize. We don’t think we did anything wrong.” Hannah Gaskill/The Baltimore Sun.

 COLUMN: DEMS TARGET HARRIS AGAIN. THIS TIME THEY MAY GET HIM: Andy Harris is a target for Maryland Democrats. Nothing new there. The Republican congressman has been a pain in their collective keister since he was first elected to the state Senate in 1998. But in 2026, an unpopular Republican president coupled with a spending bill that busts the federal budget and hurts many of Harris’ constituents could change the outcome. Rick Hutzell/The Baltimore Banner.

 MOORE’s BUDGET SECTY STEPPING DOWN: Gov. Wes Moore’s Cabinet will have another vacancy this fall, when state Budget Secretary Helene Grady will leave to start her own consulting business. Grady is the second senior administration official to announce her departure this week, after Monday’s announcement that Chief of Staff Fagan Harris is leaving, and the seventh so far this year. Her decision to leave, which will be announced by the administration Friday, was not unexpected. Bryan Sears/Maryland Matters.

 THOUSANDS OF HOPKINS PATIENTS COULD LOSE COVERAGE: Tens of thousands of patients at Johns Hopkins Medicine could be out of network starting Monday if the hospital system and UnitedHealthcare don’t reach an agreement. Clara Longo de Freitas/The Baltimore Banner.
