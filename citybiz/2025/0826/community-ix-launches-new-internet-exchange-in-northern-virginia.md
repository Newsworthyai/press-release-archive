# Community IX Launches New Internet Exchange in Northern Virginia

Community IX, operator of the FL-IX (South Florida) and CIX-ATL (Atlanta) Internet Exchanges, today announces the launch of its newest Internet Exchange (IX) in Northern Virginia, named CIX-NoVA. Service will initially be offered through data centers in Ashburn and Reston, marking Community IX’s first presence in the Northern Virginia market, with additional locations under review.

 Driven by customer demand, CIX-NoVA will expand interconnection capabilities in the world’s largest data center and connectivity market. With more than 30Tbps of port capacity already installed across its existing IX locations, Community IX has secured strong interest and committed participants to anchor the new CIX-NoVA exchange.

 “Since beginning operations in 2015, we’ve focused on providing a cost-effective, community-driven service to our membership and have experienced tremendous growth in Florida and later in the Atlanta Metro market. Over the years, we’ve been asked what other markets we can offer our service and Northern Virginia has consistently come up in conversation,” said Randy Epstein, co-founder and Executive Director of Community IX.

 CIX-NoVA enables ISPs, content providers, and enterprises to exchange IP traffic quickly, cost-effectively, and seamlessly across multiple sites in Northern Virginia. The exchange is currently open to participants with networks in Ashburn and Reston, VA. New 10G and 100G port connections are being offered free for the first year with a two-year agreement. See our website for specific locations and details. 400G port speeds are also available, though not included in the promotion.
