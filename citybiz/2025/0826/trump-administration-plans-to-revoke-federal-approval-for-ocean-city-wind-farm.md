# Trump Administration Plans To Revoke Federal Approval For Ocean City Wind Farm

The Trump administration said Monday it plans to revoke the key federal permit issued to US Wind for wind farm proposed off the coast of Ocean City.

 In a court filing Monday, the government said that the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management — which issued the critical construction and operations permit near the end of President Joe Biden’s (D) administration — is “in the process of reconsidering its prior approval” for the wind project.

 The federal government is “intending to move no later than September 12 to remand and, separately, to vacate” the approval document,” read the court filing in the U.S. District Court of Maryland.

 The government’s proposal to rescind the “construction and operations plan” permit it issued in December was filed jointly with Ocean City — which had sued the government last year in an attempt to block the wind farm. The reversal by the government left the project developer, US Wind, fighting to keep the previously approved permit in place.

 In a statement Monday, US Wind Vice President of External Affairs Nancy Sopko said that the company still believes in the validity of its 2024 federal permit.

 “Our construction and operations plan approval is the subject of ongoing litigation, but we remain confident that the federal permits we secured after a multi-year and rigorous public review process are legally sound,” Sopko’s statement said.
