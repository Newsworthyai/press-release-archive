# Gilat Awarded Extra $25 Million to Drive Digital Inclusion Across Peru

Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd. (NASDAQ: GILT, TASE: GILT), a worldwide leader in satellite networking technology, solutions and services, announced today that its Peruvian subsidiary, Gilat Perú, has signed an additional $25 million agreement with Pronatel (Programa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones), Peru’s national telecommunications program. This award is for the modernization of the Regional Broadband network in the Cusco region. The migration is planned over the next 12 months, with services to be delivered for a period of five years.

 The upgraded network will provide high-speed internet of 200 Mbps to nearly 208 public institutions, including schools, health centers, and police stations, and 69 public free WiFi Hotspots. This digital inclusion initiative will improve access to education, healthcare, and public safety services, while laying the groundwork for future bandwidth growth in rural areas that need it most.

 This new project builds on Gilat’s ongoing partnership with the Peruvian State and underscores the company’s commitment to bringing advanced connectivity to even the most remote and hard-to-reach regions.

 “Our decades of experience delivering large-scale connectivity initiatives across Peru positions us to complete this migration quickly and effectively,” said Arieh Rohrstock, Corporate Senior Vice President and President, Gilat Peru. “In partnership with Pronatel, we are expanding digital inclusion by bringing the high-speed infrastructure required to strengthen critical public services in Peru’s most remote communities.”
