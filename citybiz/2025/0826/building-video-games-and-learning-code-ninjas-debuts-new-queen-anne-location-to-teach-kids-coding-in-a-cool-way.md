# Building Video Games and Learning? Code Ninjas Debuts New Queen Anne Location to Teach Kids Coding in a Cool Way

Say the words “video game” and your kids are bound to stop and listen. The local owner of the new Code Ninjas, a learning center that will open on July 28 at 513 1st Ave. West, #B, Seattle, Washington, next to the Space Needle, knows that video games aren’t only fun, but educational. Code Ninjas will serve the local area of Queen Anne, Magnolia, South Lake Union, Downtown, Fremont, and surroundings by teaching children computer coding and problem-solving skills while having fun building video games.

 The newest Queen Anne Code Ninjas location is owned by local father and entrepreneur Atul Goyal and his daughters – 20-year-old Kaia and 16-year-old Kyra. Since moving to the United States in 2005 from New Delhi, India, he has worked in telecom at T-Mobile, AT&T and C-Spire before shifting to AWS cloud engineering. Throughout his time in the U.S., he has earned his MBA from the University of Dallas, while also completing his computer science degree from BITS, Pilani in India. His venture into entrepreneurship is driven by his daughters to build something for them. His eldest daughter Kaia, who is studying physical therapy at University of Washington, will serve as operations director, while his younger daughter, who has a passion for math and entrepreneurship herself, will work after school as a Sensei.

 “As someone who loves math and has seen first-hand the tech-driven future we are headed towards, Code Ninjas was an easy decision to join,” said Goyal. “Code Ninjas plays a critical role in building a foundation for the children in our community. I am privileged to be able to play a role and offering Code Ninjas to more kids.”

 Queen Anne and surrounding community children ages 5-14 can look forward to visiting the new Code Ninjas center to learn how to code in a fun, safe, and social learning environment where gaming is celebrated, and STEM is cool. Everything about Code Ninjas is built around fun, which keeps kids coming back. The center also delivers the results that parents are looking for, as their children gain coding and problem-solving skills they’ll need for the jobs of the future. At Code Ninjas, kids have fun and parents see results.

 Summer camps will be available at the Queen Anne location beginning on August 1. To find additional information about camps, please visit: www.codeninjas.com/wa-queen-anne.

 Code Ninjas accomplishes this with a robust, game-based curriculum made up of nine belts, just like martial arts. The curriculum is self-paced, but not self-taught; kids get immediate help and encouragement from Code Senseis and fellow students as they advance from white to black belt. The program keeps kids motivated with little wins along the way, and “Belt-Up” celebrations to honor their graduation to the next level. By the time a child finishes the program, they will publish an app in an app store.

 Code Ninjas offers a variety of opportunities for children to get involved, including a flexible weeknight drop-in program, camps and Parents Night Out events on weekends.
