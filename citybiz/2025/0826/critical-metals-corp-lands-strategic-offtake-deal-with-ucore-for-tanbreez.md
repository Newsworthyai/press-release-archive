# Critical Metals Corp Lands Strategic Offtake Deal with Ucore for Tanbreez

Critical Metals Corp. (Nasdaq: CRML) (“Critical Metals Corp” or the “Company”), a leading critical minerals mining company, today announced that it has signed a letter of intent (LOI) for an offtake agreement with Ucore Rare Metals Inc (“Ucore”), a leader in rare-and critical-metal resources, extraction, beneficiation, and separation technologies.

 Under the terms of the multi-year offtake arrangement, Critical Metals Corp expects to supply up to 10,000 metric tons annually of rare earth concentrate from its Tanbreez Project, which represents approximately 10% of the project’s initial projected production. After hydro-metallurgical processing, the concentrate will be used as feedstock for Ucore’s rare earth element processing facility, which is focused on heavy rare earths and broke ground in May, in Alexandria, Louisiana and Ucore’s facility in Kingston, Ontario. The Louisiana facility, which received support and funding from the state government and the U.S. Department of Defense, will produce high-purity rare earth oxides from mixed rare earth carbonates or oxides, which Critical Metals Corp expects to produce at Tanbreez.

 “Critical Metals Corp’s Tanbreez offers tremendous opportunities for Ucore given the significant concentration of heavy rare earths it contains, which are essential for our processing facility in Louisiana, and our downstream partners,” said Pat Ryan, Chairman and CEO of Ucore. “Both Critical Metals Corp and Ucore share a vision to lessen China’s grip of the rare earth ecosystem in the West, and we look forward to our partnership, positioning us both to meet the growing demand for rare earths while addressing national security challenges.”

 “This development further validates the opportunities ahead for Critical Metals Corp and the strength of our world-class asset in Southern Greenland,” said Tony Sage, CEO and Executive Chairman of Critical Metals Corp. “Securing this offtake provides Critical Metals Corp both with our first buyer and the flexibility to supply other US based rare earth facilities in the future, given the immense size of our Tanbreez deposit. We look forward to teaming up with Ucore and their exceptional team to support the development of a robust supply chain in America that isn’t reliant on China.”

 Next Steps

 The parties are working expeditiously toward definitive documentation. The execution of definitive agreements remains subject to customary conditions including completion of due diligence, finalization of commercial terms, and necessary approvals.
