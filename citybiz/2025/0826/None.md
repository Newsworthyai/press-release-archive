# Gramophone Design Build Expands Services with New Brand Identity

Gramophone Design Build, a premier design-build firm based in Hunt Valley, Maryland, has officially rebranded from its former name, Maryland Kitchen Design Center by Gramophone. The new name reflects the company’s expanded expertise that is available all under one roof to clients throughout Maryland.

 Gramophone Design Build’s in-house team manages every project from concept to completion, offering everything from design, construction, and technology integration, to project management, all through an integrated team approach. Their unified portfolio includes home renovations and additions, interior design, smart home integration, custom cabinetry and millwork, and licensed electrical contracting.

Aligning under the Gramophone Design Build name allows us to better represent our comprehensive services, while fully embracing the craftsmanship, design excellence, and innovation that define the Gramophone legacy.”

 Gramophone Design Build will culminate the rebrand with an invite-only event on September 25 in the newly renovated company showroom. For more information, visit www.gramophonedesignbuild.com.
