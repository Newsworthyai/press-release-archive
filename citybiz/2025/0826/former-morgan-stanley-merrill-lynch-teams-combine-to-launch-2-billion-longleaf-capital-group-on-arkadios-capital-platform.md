# Former Morgan Stanley &amp; Merrill Lynch Teams Combine to Launch $2 Billion Longleaf Capital Group on Arkadios Capital Platform

In a rare move in the wealth management industry, two elite advisory teams from Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have combined their practices to form Longleaf Capital Group, an independent wealth management firm with more than $2 billion in assets under advisement on the Arkadios Capital platform.

 The six founding directors bring 175+ years of combined experience across wealth management, institutional investing, accounting, banking and insurance. Their decision to unite coming from competing global wirehouses reflects a growing national trend of top advisors leaving large banks in favor of the independence and flexibility of the hybrid RIA model. Together, they have guided clients through multiple market cycles, advised on complex estate and tax matters and built long-term relationships with high-net-worth individuals, families and institutions.

 “By joining forces, we’ve combined complementary expertise in wealth management, personal financial planning, tax planning, institutional retirement planning and estate planning strategies under one roof,” said Jonathan D. Lee, Managing Director, Longleaf Capital Group. “Arkadios provides the infrastructure and resources to let us operate as entrepreneurs while still offering institutional-quality tools and support for our clients.”

 “This is the kind of high-caliber team and unique founding story that doesn’t happen often in our industry,” said David Millican, CEO of Arkadios Capital. “By uniting, Longleaf Capital Group is positioned to deliver truly comprehensive services to clients at the highest level.”

 Based in Dothan, Ala., Longleaf Capital Group offers full-service capabilities including financial and retirement planning, institutional retirement plan consulting, estate and tax strategies, alternative investments, insurance solutions, liquidity event planning and philanthropic advisory. The team includes two former CPAs, four Certified Financial Planner professionals and specialists with advanced designations in institutional retirement plans, estate planning and tax optimization.

 The founding partners include Todd P. Thornell, Sr., a former managing director and senior financial advisor with Merrill Lynch; Cory A. Singletary, CFP®, a former senior financial advisor with Merrill Lynch; C. Thomas Lee, CFP®, a former senior vice president and wealth advisor at Morgan Stanley with earlier experience at Merrill Lynch; George M. Liddon, CFP®, a former senior vice president and wealth advisor at Morgan Stanley with earlier experience at Merrill Lynch; Jonathan D. Lee, CFP®, a former first vice president and senior portfolio manager with earlier experience at Merrill Lynch and Lee E. Forehand, CIMA®, C(k)P®, CPFA, a nationally recognized retirement plan consultant and former Morgan Stanley corporate retirement director.
