# C&amp;D Industrial Takes Strategic Growth Investment From Crescentia Capital

Crescentia Capital, the equity buyout unit of Towson, Md.-based Calvert Street Investment Partners, has announced a strategic growth investment in Bradenton, Fla.-based C&D Industrial Maintenance, a provider of commercial door and loading dock services across the Southeast.

 The investment is expected to fuel organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions, as C&D builds the region’s leading door & dock services platform, the Baltimore firm said.

 Founded in 2018, C&D serves customers in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, North Carolina and South Carolina.

 Current Capital Partners acted as financial advisor to Crescentia Capital. Petra Capital Partners provided financing in support of the transaction. Stevens & Lee and Willkie Farr & Gallagher served as legal counsel to Crescentia Capital.

 Crescentia Capital’s current portfolio of nine companies includes All Clear, D2K and Terra Nova.

Former Ernst & Young executive Michael Booth is a partner and chief investment officer of Crescentia Capital, while Brian Guerin is managing partner. Both are members of Calvert Street’s Executive Leadership Committee.

 Prior to joining the firm in 2005, Guerin specialized in M&A transactions between private equity firms and middle market companies while serving the Corporate Finance and Due Diligence groups at Ernst & Young. He has also worked at Arthur Andersen.

 Calvert Street Investment Partners, which also has offices in Newton, Mass., operates two units — Parkway Capital, which provides flexible junior capital solutions to lower-middle market companies, and Crescentia Capital.

 Parkway Capital makes mezzanine debt and minority equity investments of between $3 million and $12 million per transaction. Typically, it invests in companies with $10 million in annual revenue and $2 million of EBITDA. Since its inception, Parkway Capital has invested over $500 million. Its portfolio is over 70 strong, with the companies spanning manufacturing, distribution, consumer products, business and industrial services, and healthcare.

 As of June, Calvert Street had invested over $1.1 billion — about $615 million in equity buyout investments and about $525 million in mezzanine and minority equity investments. It has backed over 145 middle-market companies.
