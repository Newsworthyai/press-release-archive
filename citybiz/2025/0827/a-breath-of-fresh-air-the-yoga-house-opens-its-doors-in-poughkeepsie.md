# A Breath of Fresh Air: The Yoga House Opens its Doors in Poughkeepsie

Invites Public to Free Opening Weekend Classes

 After nearly a year of anticipation and ground-up construction, The Yoga House, an award-winning yoga studio owned and operated by Amy Reed and Joyce San Pedro, will open its third location – and first in Dutchess County – on Saturday, September 6, at 2623 South Road (Route 9) in Poughkeepsie. The Hudson Valley community is invited to celebrate the studio’s new beginnings, meet founders Amy and Joyce and sample The Yoga House’s inclusive and uplifting offerings during a weekend-long grand opening, including a ribbon cutting on Saturday, September 6, at 12:30 p.m.

 From 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturday, September 6, and Sunday, September 7, guests will have a chance to explore The Yoga House’s breadth of offerings through free 30-minute vignette classes. A glimpse into The Yoga House’s approach to holistic wellness, these mini sessions will include various types of yoga, like Vinyasa and Restorative, plus TRX (total resistance exercise), Pilates, fusion classes and more.

 Attendees will also have the opportunity to get to know other neighboring local businesses – like Foam & Wash Car Wash, Crumbl, Moonburger and Sweet Cheeks Aesthetics – and enter for a chance to win free one-on-one sessions, classes, membership passes, The Yoga House apparel, a yoga prop package and more. In addition, the public is invited to sign up for the studio’s unlimited membership pass before Monday, September 8, to receive a highly discounted “Founding Member” rate of $99 per month for three months.

 “Every corner of this location has been thoughtfully designed with our members’ wellness journey in mind,” said Amy. “The Yoga House’s new home is more than a yoga studio – it’s a gateway to wellness. We cannot wait to welcome this community into our sanctuary and grow in our practice together.”

 In addition to the disciplines being highlighted throughout the grand opening weekend, The Yoga House’s Poughkeepsie studio will offer Barre, guided meditation, sound baths and Reiki. Demonstrating their inclusive approach, Amy and Joyce will offer many classes both in-person and virtually, through its sister studio in Kingston, ensuring all practitioners can participate —regardless of physical ability, schedule or location. The studio’s on-site showers, in addition to its convenient location and ample parking, make it a user-oriented stop for locals and visitors alike, including commuters.

 Notably, Amy and Joyce chose to omit mirrors from the Poughkeepsie studio’s design. Recognizing that mirrors draw people’s attention outward, the co-owners decided to leave the studio’s walls bare, reinforcing its role as a wellness sanctuary and enabling visitors to practice introspection while focusing on their body, mind and spirit.

 “We encourage those who practice with us to work in, rather than work out,” said Joyce. “We believe that the key to living well is having harmony between the body, mind and spirit, and our goal is to not only build strength and flexibility but establish mindfulness practices that prepare people to live and age well.”

 “Whatever stage of your wellness journey you’re in, we hope you’ll join us to explore your body, quiet your mind and, most importantly, connect with your true self,” added Amy.
