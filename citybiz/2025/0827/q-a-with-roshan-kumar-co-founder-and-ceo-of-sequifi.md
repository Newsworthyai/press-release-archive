# Q&amp;A with Roshan Kumar, Co-Founder and CEO of Sequifi

Roshan Kumar is the Co-Founder and CEO of Sequifi, the modern workforce infrastructure platform for America’s essential home services industry. Built by field services veterans, Sequifi provides real-time payroll, forecasting, HR, and performance tools to help companies retain and grow their workforces.

 Recently, Sequifi raised $6.7 million in seed funding led by Cervin Ventures to accelerate product development and expand into new market segments. Under Roshan’s leadership, Sequifi is tackling one of the nation’s most pressing workforce challenges: retaining the skilled tradespeople building America’s future.

 What inspired you to create Sequifi, and how did your background shape the company’s mission?

 We started Sequifi because we lived this problem. Before building software, we were in the field—installers, crew leads, operators. We knew firsthand how outdated back-office systems hurt both businesses and workers. Crews would finish a tough job on a hot roof and then wait weeks to get paid because of manual payroll processes. For an industry this essential and this large, that’s unacceptable.

 Our mission is simple: give home service businesses the infrastructure they need to scale and give workers the transparency and same-day pay they deserve. This isn’t about perks; it’s about fixing a broken system that’s driving people out of vital trades.

 Why is this such an urgent problem for the home services industry right now?

 The stakes are enormous. By 2030, the U.S. home services market is projected to hit $156 billion, but 2.1 million skilled trade jobs could go unfilled. At the same time, AI is fueling demand for exactly these roles—electricians, HVAC techs, solar installers—because every AI data center, EV charging station, and smart building still needs human hands to build and maintain it.

 Yet more than 50% of home service companies struggle to find qualified workers, and turnover sits around 45%—mostly because of delayed pay, confusing commissions, and outdated systems. If we don’t address this, we’re looking at stalled projects, longer waits, and higher costs across the board.

 How does Sequifi’s platform address those challenges differently from existing solutions?

 We’re purpose-built for this industry. Most payroll or HR systems were designed for predictable, desk-based work with salaried employees—not for crews whose schedules depend on weather, job complexity, or seasonal demand.

 Sequifi brings everything into one platform:

 * Same-Day Payroll so workers see money hit their account when the job’s done.
* Real-Time Commission Tracking so disputes vanish and trust goes up.
* Forecasting & HR Tools that help businesses staff correctly, even in volatile conditions.
* Scalability to support teams of 100 to 5,000+ without months of painful onboarding.

 It’s about eliminating friction so businesses can grow and workers can build careers, not just punch a clock.

 What kind of impact have you seen so far from companies using Sequifi?

 The results have been transformative. Take Aveyo, a solar installation company: before Sequifi, their crews waited weeks to get paid. Now they pay installers the same day, and retention has skyrocketed. Source MRKTG, in pest control, cut payroll processing time by 75%, eliminated pay disputes, and even saw technicians move into leadership roles because they finally trusted the system.

 Better payroll isn’t just an admin win—it unlocks economic mobility, job creation, and stronger communities. When you keep skilled workers in the field, you keep projects moving and local economies growing.

 What role does lived experience play in building solutions for this space?

 It’s everything. You can’t design for trades from a spreadsheet. You have to understand what it’s like to juggle jobs that depend on weather, to make payroll when storms wipe out a week of work, to motivate crews during seasonal lulls. That’s why Sequifi resonates—we’ve been there, and we’re solving problems we wish we’d had solutions for.

 This isn’t a side market for us; it’s our world. And that authenticity shows up in the product every day.

 Where is Sequifi headed next with this new round of funding?

 This seed round lets us double down on product development—more automation, richer forecasting, and expanding into adjacent markets like mortgage and fiber. We’re also growing our go-to-market team to bring these tools to more companies that desperately need them.

 Longer term, we see Sequifi as the backbone of America’s skilled workforce infrastructure—a system that ensures the people building our future have the tools, transparency, and pay practices worthy of their work.

 What’s your message to business leaders in home services who are hesitant to modernize?

 If you’re still running payroll on spreadsheets, you’re not just creating headaches—you’re losing workers, revenue, and reputation. Skilled trades are the backbone of our economy. Treating them like professionals with modern tools isn’t optional; it’s survival. The companies that embrace this now will be the ones thriving in 2030.
