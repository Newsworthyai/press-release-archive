# Qualys Secures FedRAMP® High Authorization for Its Comprehensive Risk Management Platform

Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ: QLYS), a leading provider of disruptive cloud-based IT, security, and compliance solutions, today announced the Qualys Government Platform has achieved FedRAMP High Authorization, sponsored by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). This authorization makes Qualys one of the few cybersecurity platforms offering a full-spectrum security solution at the FedRAMP High level and positions it among an elite group of vendors trusted to support the federal government’s most sensitive systems.

 Many federal agencies struggle with limited staff and fragmented security tools, making it hard to assess and manage cyber risk. Qualys addresses this with a unified cyber risk management platform that delivers broad visibility and control across the entire risk surface. Now FedRAMP High Authorized, the Qualys Government Platform offers vulnerability management, compliance, endpoint detection and response (EDR), asset inventory, policy enforcement, web application security, and soon cloud-native application protection – all in a single, scalable solution designed to meet the highest federal security standards.

 FedRAMP High is the most rigorous authorization level within the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, aligning with NIST 800-53 High Impact controls. It is reserved for cloud services that handle the government’s most sensitive, unclassified data. Platforms at this level are designed to support mission and business critical workloads.

 “Achieving FedRAMP High Authorization underscores our significant investment in best-in-class security and reaffirms our commitment as a trusted partner in advancing the U.S. Federal Government’s mission to strengthen cybersecurity,” said Sumedh Thakar, president and CEO of Qualys. “As threats grow, organizations need unified visibility, scalable automation, and confidence in their security stack. This milestone demonstrates that the Qualys Government Platform enables customers to efficiently reduce risk and safeguard their most critical assets across public and private sectors.”
