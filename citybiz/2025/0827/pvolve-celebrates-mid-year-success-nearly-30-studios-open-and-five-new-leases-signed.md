# Pvolve Celebrates Mid-Year Success: Nearly 30 Studios Open and Five New Leases Signed

Pvolve, the clinically-backed functional fitness franchise that strengthens, stabilizes, and mobilizes your body, is celebrating remarkable growth as summer comes to a close. The brand now boasts nearly 30 open and operating studios and expects to reach 40 total locations by the end of 2025. The growth highlights the rising demand for Pvolve’s smarter, sustainable approach to fitness and the strength of its franchise opportunity.

 Pvolve’s expansion shows no signs of slowing. In recent weeks, the brand signed five new studio leases, marking the start of new communities embracing functional movement and long-term health. The system also includes more than 50 studios in development, five locations in presale, another five in lease review and multiple studios in site selection – fueling the fastest growth phase in the company’s history.

 The newly signed leases include:

 * Pvolve San Francisco: 301 Howard St., San Francisco, CA
* Pvolve Pleasantville: 17 Washington Ave., Pleasantville, NY
* Pvolve Scottsdale Waterfront: 7135 E. Camelback Rd., Scottsdale, AZ
* Pvolve San Antonio: 7959 Broadway St., Suite 600, San Antonio, TX
* Pvolve Louisville: 3723 Lexington Rd., Suite 203, Louisville, KY

 “Our development pipeline has never been stronger,” said Alex Puccillo, Executive Director of Franchise Development. “Five new leases and growing presale activity show how excited consumers are about the Pvolve method and how confident entrepreneurs are in our model. The energy across our system is incredible, and this is only the beginning.”

 At the midpoint of the year, Pvolve’s momentum is best reflected in the people driving it. Franchise partners come from diverse backgrounds, including health care, corporate leadership and long-time member communities. Many are building something meaningful in their neighborhoods while creating scalable businesses. With Pvolve’s hybrid model of in-studio classes, digital streaming and proprietary equipment, franchisees can reach members wherever they are.

 “As we look back on the first half of the year, what stands out to me is the incredible momentum building around this brand,” said Julie Cartwright, President of Pvolve. “Every new studio represents people coming together to strengthen their bodies and their confidence, and every new franchise

 partner brings passion and vision to our mission. The energy we’re seeing right now makes me so excited for what’s ahead in the second half of the year and beyond.”

 Franchise opportunities remain available in high-growth U.S. markets including Texas, Florida, North Carolina and other major metro areas. Pvolve is seeking single- and multi-unit operators who are passionate about health, wellness and building community through functional fitness.
