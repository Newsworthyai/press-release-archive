# Q&amp;A with Daniel Stanton, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Now Optics

Daniel Stanton is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Now Optics, one of America’s fastest-growing vision care companies and the parent brand of Stanton Optical. Since founding the company in 2006, Stanton has led Now Optics with a mission to make eye care easy—delivering affordable, accessible, and technology-driven vision solutions for every customer.

 Under his leadership, Now Optics has grown from a bold startup to a national omnichannel powerhouse with over 300 locations across 32 states, serving millions of patients through a seamless combination of retail stores, telehealth-enabled eye exams, and an integrated e-commerce platform. His strategy of combining high-quality care with in-store convenience has redefined the optical industry and helped position Now Optics as a leader in full-service, value-driven eye care.

 A passionate innovator, Stanton pioneered the use of ocular telehealth in retail optometry, launching the company’s first virtual exam platform in 2016—years ahead of industry adoption. Today, affiliated doctors at Now Optics locations have performed over 4 million telehealth-enabled eye exams, making vision care more efficient, scalable, and accessible than ever before.

 Through his “Easy Eye Care” model, Stanton has championed a patient-first approach that blends affordable pricing, stylish eyewear, and same-day service, all supported by cutting-edge diagnostic technology. This includes recent clinical expansions into advanced eye health services, such as dry eye therapy and retinal imaging, broadening the company’s scope in preventive care and chronic disease management.

 Stanton is a veteran operator with deep expertise in retail, healthcare delivery, and scalable innovation. As a founder-led organization in a rapidly evolving industry, Now Optics continues to break new ground under his leadership—earning national recognition for reimagining how eye care is delivered across the U.S.

 What first drew you to the optical industry? Was this always a field you were passionate about?

 I discovered my passion for eye care as a college student, working in a variety of roles for a well-known optical retailer. It didn’t take long for me to notice how frustrating the experience could be for customers – limited choices, high prices, and long waits to get glasses. I knew there had to be a better way. In 2006, I founded Stanton Optical with a simple mission: to make buying eyewear easier, more affordable, and actually enjoyable. We offered a wide selection, fair prices, and faster turnaround times, and the response was incredible. By the end of our first year, we had already expanded to five additional locations across the country.

 What role has technology played in your business model, especially in areas like telehealth and scheduling?

 Technology and innovation aren’t just buzz words at Now Optics, they’re the foundation of how we’re redefining the eye care experience. Our vision has always been to make high-quality eye care more easy, affordable and accessible. By integrating advanced ocular telehealth technology, we’ve automated routine elements of the exam, enabling doctors to dedicate more time to in-depth diagnostics and personalized care. This model not only streamlines visits and shortens wait times, but also expands access by connecting our customers with doctors more quickly, no matter where they are. It’s a scalable, future-ready approach that ensures we can meet the growing demand for eye care while keeping the patient and customer experience at the center of everything we do.

 Do you have plans to open more stores across the U.S.?

 We currently operate over 300 locations in 32 states and plan to open 40 more next year. We want to make the process of getting eyewear easy and accessible to all. With our telehealth model, we are able to bring eye care to even the most remote communities. In addition to expanding our standalone stores, we’re excited about our new partnership agreement with Staples, where we will roll out Stanton Optical “store-in-store” locations at select Staples stores. Construction on the first stores will begin in Fall 2025, in Pennsylvania.

 How do you see the eyecare/optical industry changing in the next 5 years?

 The eye care industry is changing fast, as people expect more convenience and quicker access to care. Telehealth eye exams, same-day glasses, and tech-driven innovations are already reshaping how patients experience vision care.

 At Now Optics, we’re right at the forefront of this shift. As the largest founder-owned and operated eye care platform in the U.S., we provide full-service to our patients combining retail, manufacturing, telehealth, and technology under one roof. Since 2016, we’ve conducted more than four million telehealth exams in partnership with Physicians Eyecare Group helping to ease the nationwide shortage of eye care professionals while making quality vision care faster and more accessible.

 What consumer trends are you seeing or anticipating?

 Technology is redefining how consumers approach vision care, and two trends that stand out are telehealth and smart eyewear.

 Telehealth has already proven itself, making eye care more convenient, efficient, and accessible, especially in areas with shortages of eye care professionals. Demand continues to grow, and I expect it will only become more central to how people get care.

 At the same time, smart eyewear is moving from novelty to everyday use. Features like light-responsive lenses, real-time translation, and health tracking are blending style with function in ways that make eyewear more than just a vision tool. As these technologies evolve, they’re not just advancing eye care; they’re empowering us to see the world — and ourselves — in entirely new ways.”
