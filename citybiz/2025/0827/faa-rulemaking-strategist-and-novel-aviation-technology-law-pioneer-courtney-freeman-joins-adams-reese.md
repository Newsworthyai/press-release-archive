# FAA Rulemaking Strategist and Novel Aviation Technology Law Pioneer Courtney Freeman Joins Adams &amp; Reese

Adams & Reese is pleased to announce that Courtney W. Freeman has joined the AmLaw 200 firm as Counsel and as a member of its Chambers-ranked Aviation & Aerospace Team. Freeman served for more than a decade in the Regulations Division of the Federal Aviation Administration’s Office of the Chief Counsel as the lead attorney for several groundbreaking projects.

 “I am incredibly grateful to my FAA colleagues who have been phenomenal teachers, mentors, and co-workers,” Freeman says. “My decade with the agency has been invaluable, helping me develop into the regulatory attorney I am today, and I’m excited to bring that unique government and regulatory perspective to my new role at Adams & Reese.”

 Freeman’s FAA work focused on emerging aviation technologies, including Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) drone operations, Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), including powered lift aircraft (vertical takeoff and landing), and other initiatives. She led the teams that provided the legal architecture for these technologies, including implementation of a recent Executive Order, “Unleashing American Drone Dominance.”

 “Courtney has been instrumental in developing and supporting many of the regulatory frameworks for the FAA’s most forward-looking programs, so she has a deep understanding of the federal policy-making and rule-making processes and a keen insight into the challenges and opportunities of implementation, including waivers, exemptions, compliance, and enforcement,” said Marc Warren, Co-Leader of the Adams & Reese Aviation & Aerospace Team.

 Warren, a former FAA acting chief counsel, deputy chief counsel and leader of the aviation and aerospace teams at Crowell & Moring and Jenner & Block, has known Freeman for years through the FAA. “Courtney is innovative, determined, and because of her involvement in every major operational drone and AAM initiative at the FAA, she is well-equipped to guide clients regarding their expectations and planning as new technologies, and their myriad applications, become ever more sophisticated and common.”

 Freeman also has experience in legal issues around traditional air carrier and general aviation operations, hazardous materials carriage requirements, pandemic response, environmental compliance, privacy matters, and Paperwork Reduction Act compliance. The team she led frequently handled issues of agency first impression, with Freeman often personally dispositioning the team’s most complicated legal matters.

 Within the Intersection of Business & Government (IBG) Practice Group, the Adams & Reese Aviation & Aerospace Team includes heavy hitters with years of experience in the industry, including Warren; Aviation & Aerospace Team Co-Leader and Partner Paul Alp, former senior counsel at The Boeing Company and a Partner at Jenner & Block; attorney Tyler Conklin, former in-house counsel at Atlas Air, Inc.; and now Freeman, formerly with the FAA.

 “Courtney brings substantial knowledge of the regulatory environment and challenges facing emerging air transportation systems,” said Alp. “Her experience and connections will be invaluable to our clients as we continue to build the go-to international aviation and aerospace practice for mission-critical matters.” Alp added, “Plus, Courtney is a genuinely nice person, and it is a true pleasure to welcome her to the team.”

 A Michigan native, Freeman earned her J.D. in 2013 from the University of Michigan Law School, where she served as a Notes Editor for the Michigan Journal of Environmental and Administrative Law. She received her B.A. in 2010 from Northwestern University.
