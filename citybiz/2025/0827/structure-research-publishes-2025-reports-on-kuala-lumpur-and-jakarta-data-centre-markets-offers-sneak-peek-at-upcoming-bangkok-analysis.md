# Structure Research Publishes 2025 Reports on Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta Data Centre Markets, Offers Sneak Peek at Upcoming Bangkok Analysis

Structure Research, a leading independent research firm focused on cloud and data centre infrastructure, has released its latest reports: the Kuala Lumpur DCAI Report 2025: Data Centre Colocation, Hyperscale Cloud, AI & Interconnection and the Jakarta DCI Report 2025: Data Centre Colocation, Hyperscale Cloud & Interconnection. These comprehensive studies provide in-depth analyses of two of Southeast Asia’s fastest-growing data centre markets, highlighting their rapid evolution and emerging roles as strategic hubs in the region.

 The Kuala Lumpur data centre colocation market is projected to be worth USD $300 million in 2025 and is expected to reach $1.1 billion by 2030, representing a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31%. This growth is driven by hyperscale cloud expansion, AI infrastructure development, and Kuala Lumpur’s strategic positioning near Singapore and Johor.

 The Jakarta data centre colocation market is projected to be worth USD $507.2 million in 2025 and is expected to grow at a five-year CAGR of 11% through 2030, reaching $856 million. The market continues to grow steadily, with hyperscale cloud stabilizing after a period of deceleration, Chinese cloud platforms resuming CapEx investment, and AI-native providers entering the region.

 “Southeast Asia is entering a transformative phase of infrastructure buildout, and both Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta are becoming central to the next wave of growth,” said Philbert Shih, Managing Director of Structure Research. “Hyperscale and AI infrastructure platforms are reshaping deployment models, and these markets are well-positioned to support new demand patterns, regional redundancy, and diverse workloads.”

 Key Findings from the Reports

 Kuala Lumpur: Emerging as a Strategic AI and Cloud Hub

 * Hyperscale cloud providers—including Alibaba Cloud, AWS, Microsoft, and Google—are expanding their presence in Kuala Lumpur, with a mix of colocation, built-to-suit, and self-build strategies.
* The city is poised to attract AI inference and cloud infrastructure workloads, leveraging its proximity to Singapore and Johor.
* The report tracks self-build and leasing activity, market inventory, demand segmentation, and regional interconnection dynamics.

 Jakarta: Steady Growth Amid Market Realignment

 * Over 65MW of hyperscale colocation inventory is expected to come online in 2025, with overall capacity projected to double by 2030.
* Chinese clouds are recovering from a downturn and re-engaging with new investments, while U.S.-based hyperscalers and AI-focused platforms are increasing market presence.
* Jakarta is seeing renewed interest in interconnection, particularly from global operators and enterprises seeking to diversify deployments across the region.

 Both reports provide detailed data on market size, hyperscale leasing, self-build capacity, interconnection, and geographic clustering, equipping investors, operators, and stakeholders with insights to guide expansion strategies in Southeast Asia.
