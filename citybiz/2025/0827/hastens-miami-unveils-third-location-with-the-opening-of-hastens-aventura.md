# Hästens Miami Unveils Third Location with the Opening of Hästens Aventura

Hästens, the iconic Swedish bedmaker celebrated worldwide for its handcrafted, all-natural beds, is now open with the grand opening of Hästens Aventura this September at the brand-new luxury shopping center, Esplanade at Aventura (19505 Biscayne Blvd., Suite 2140). The new showroom will redefine the sleep experience in South Florida with a complete sleep spa and ongoing wellness programming, introducing residents and visitors to the pinnacle of rest.

 With more than 170 years of legacy, Hästens has earned global recognition for elevating sleep into an art form. Each bed crafted from the finest natural materials including horsehair, cotton, wool and flax offers unparalleled comfort, breathability and body responsiveness. Fans of the brand include celebrities and Miami’s own star athletes, who turn to Hästens for the life-changing quality of its designs.

 The new Aventura location will showcase Hästens’ full collection, from the Maranga, Herlewing, and Eala to the iconic 2000T, drēmer, Vividus and the Grand Vividus, a masterpiece bed that can be customized at a cost upwards of six figures. Each model reflects Hästens’ dedication to craftsmanship, innovation and the science of restorative, holistic sleep.

 “Miami is truly waking up to the importance of sleep as a cornerstone of wellness,” says Juan Quintero, owner of Hästens Aventura and all Hästens Miami locations. “People are recognizing that investing in their rest is just as important as investing in their fitness or nutrition. With demand for premium sleep solutions doubling year after year, we felt it was the perfect time to expand into Aventura and give more of our community access to the transformative experience of a Hästens bed.”

 More than a traditional showroom, Hästens Aventura is designed as an immersive sleep spa. Guests can participate in private consultations, explore the brand’s extensive collection and test the beds in a tranquil, spa-like environment that includes guided meditation, sound baths, essential oils, sleep masks and tips from an on-site sleep expert. The location will also host educational programs and community events, spotlighting the critical connection between sleep and overall health.

 The official grand opening of Hästens Aventura will take place in September, welcoming the community to experience the world’s best sleep firsthand. Event details will be announced in the coming weeks.

 With its blend of luxury, health and lifestyle, Hästens Aventura is poised to become a must-visit destination for those seeking a deeper commitment to well-being through the power of better sleep.
