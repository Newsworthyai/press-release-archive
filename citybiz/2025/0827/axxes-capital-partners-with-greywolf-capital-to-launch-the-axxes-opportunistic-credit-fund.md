# Axxes Capital Partners with Greywolf Capital to Launch the Axxes Opportunistic Credit Fund

Axxes Capital, a private markets investment firm dedicated to providing wealth advisors and their clients access to innovative private markets solutions, announced today the launch of the Axxes Opportunistic Credit Fund, an SEC-registered interval fund designed to offer investors exposure to opportunistic credit including stressed/distressed, special situations, structured credit, and hard assets.

 The Axxes Opportunistic Credit Fund is sub-advised by Greywolf Capital Management, LP, a $3.3 billion credit-focused investment firm with a long track record of navigating complex and dislocated markets.

 “This launch marks an important step in our mission to make institutional-quality private market strategies accessible to a broader set of investors,” said Joseph DaGrosa, Jr., Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Axxes Capital. “The Axxes Opportunistic Credit Fund was specifically designed for wealth advisors and their clients who want access to opportunistic credit without the complexities of traditional private fund structures. We’re proud to bring an efficient, transparent, and investor-friendly solution to market at a time when demand for differentiated income strategies is accelerating.”

 The Axxes Opportunistic Credit Fund seeks to deliver risk-adjusted returns while mitigating downside risk, through a flexible, actively managed portfolio. The fund structure offers low investment minimums of $25,000, no capital calls, simplified 1099 tax reporting, liquidity through quarterly redemptions of 5% of the Fund’s NAV, daily NAV investing, and multiple share classes.

 “We’re pleased to partner with Axxes Capital to deliver our institutional credit expertise through a structure that meets the needs of today’s wealth advisor,” said Jon Savitz, CEO of Greywolf Capital Management. “We believe the current environment continues to present compelling dislocated and event-driven credit opportunities. Our approach, developed over two decades, is grounded in deep credit research and disciplined risk management. Through this partnership, we can now bring our capabilities to a wider audience seeking durable, less correlated returns.”

 The fund’s flexible investment mandate allows it to allocate capital across opportunistic credit, including stressed/distressed, special situations, structured credit and hard assets, positioning the fund to adapt as markets evolve.
