# Q&amp;A with Arturo Vasquez, Design Principal and Senior Architect at Stantec: Moving Florida’s Transit-Oriented Developments Forward

Arturo Vasquez is a principal and senior architect at Stantec with over 37 years of experience leading integrated design teams and multiple client groups. He is part of the Principal-led Integrated Practice team at the firm’s Miami office. Arturo has extensive experience merging master planning and architectural design for complex projects in mixed-use, multifamily, and higher ed. He is a lead designer for the firms’ related markets in student housing and transit-oriented development.

 Arturo’s recent projects include the Fort Lauderdale Searstown high-density mixed-use residential development, the 79th and Biscayne mid-rise multifamily in Miami, the University of California at Davis student housing project, the Oceanside, California mixed-use transit-oriented development, and the Homestead Triangle transit district mixed-use development project.

 Why is transit-oriented development (TOD) especially important in Florida’s urban growth strategy to help solve its transportation and housing challenges?

 TOD provides an alternative to isolated, parcel-by-parcel developments by promoting cohesive growth along key corridors connected to transit hubs. It increases ridership and reduces single-use parking parcelization, easing traffic and inefficient land use within dense zones.

 How does Florida’s Live Local Act play a role in successful TODs?

 The Live Local Act combined with TOD sites creates a successful formula to incentivize increased housing affordability and densities combined with an expedited path for growth in areas of the city already served by transit and mobility. The added density and incentives create opportunities for developers to identify viable projects with reduced capital stacks. Parking reductions help limit the cost of this critical financial burden in their pro-forma.

 Florida is primed for TODs. The network of various transit lines, such as Brightline and rapid transit bus corridors, connect key cities and towns in a much more efficient manner.

 TODs by their nature support Florida’s climate patterns. In the hot, humid months, pedestrians are comforted by the proximity to transit opportunities – having to spend less time in the elements. In the mild months, communities and their inhabitants have more incentive to walk, bike, and commute while enjoying the many benefits of the mixed-use services TODs inherently provide.

 In Florida, a law passed that allows transit authorities to accept unsolicited development proposals for public-private partnerships without undertaking a public bidding process. Explain this law and what is the benefit?

 The recent legal approval of unsolicited proposals to public transit agencies opens the door for developers, architects, and transit agencies to create transformative projects across underutilized public lands.

 Simply put, the new law is unlocking growth, quickly. These P3 development strategies enable Stantec to identify and execute development scenarios, without extending the often-lengthy RFP process.

 How are you working to ignite TOD opportunities in Florida?

 Stantec has a very experienced local and national affordable housing team.

 We understand the local zoning and we have significant experience with transit related sites, developer-led P3’s and unsolicited proposal strategies. We are helping to educate the local developer network to understand the formula and how to most effectively integrate the Live Local Act and all its incentivizes.

 TOD zoning overlays primarily offers density, height, a mix of uses, and most importantly – a reduction in parking. The incentives improve transit access, limit single-car uses, and minimizes the parking requirements by using shared parking techniques and transit use incentives tied to the development. The funding is generally tied to transit and mixed-use capital stack offsets.

 What are the key considerations when designing mixed-use or high-density buildings near transit hubs in Florida?

 TODs located within a half mile of major transit hubs offer high-density, mixed-use projects that combine retail, housing at multiple price points, and vibrant public spaces. These developments create walkable, connected communities that attract residents, businesses, and visitors alike. With enhanced streetscapes, pedestrian-friendly plazas, and direct access to reliable transit, TOD projects increase property values, drive foot traffic, and support long-term economic growth. By aligning our expertise with city leadership, transit authorities, and private developers, these projects unlock unique opportunities for investors to capitalize on Florida’s expanding urban markets while contributing to thriving, livable neighborhoods.

 How do you integrate public space, retail, housing, and mobility into a cohesive TOD plan?

 A cohesive TOD master plan begins with placemaking – creating a significant public space scenario where a mix of uses can occur with areas dedicated for retail, housing, commerce, and strategic parking uses integrated into the development. This is more easily achieved with TOD sites because of the availability of land near transit hubs.

 How can architecture help bridge the gap between transportation systems and the surrounding community fabric?

 Great architecture seamlessly integrates urban design, wayfinding, placemaking, and landscapes for better public use within the neighborhood fabric adjacent to transit stations and transit hubs. As an example, our TOD architecture strategies enhance workforce mobility. In a region where commute times and traffic congestion are constant challenges, we can help connect South Florida’s growing workforce to jobs more efficiently, improving productivity and quality of life.

 What design or planning lessons from other cities or states can be adapted to Florida’s TOD efforts?

 Across the U.S., cities with strong transit networks are showing how forward-thinking zoning and TOD overlays can unlock higher density, bring affordability strategies to life, and shift communities away from car dependency. Florida is poised to lead this next wave.

 Take California’s Oceanside TOD as an example: Stantec partnered with Toll Brothers in a dynamic public-private venture that blended master planning, transit integration, landscape, placemaking, and architecture into one bold vision. This marquee Stantec project delivered affordable housing, vibrant mixed-use amenities, multimodal connections, hospitality, civic facilities, and a new transit authority headquarters all within a unified, transit-first community.
