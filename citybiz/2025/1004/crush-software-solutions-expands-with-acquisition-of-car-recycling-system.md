# Crush Software Solutions Expands with Acquisition of Car Recycling System

Crush Software Solutions LLC announced it has acquired S3 Software Solutions LLC, developer of Crush, the largest yard management system used by more than 200 self-service auto recycling yards in the U.S. and Canada. S3 will operate as Crush Software Solutions LLC. Ryan Paterson will serve as chief executive officer and founder Dimitri Gerontis will serve as chief operating officer.

 Terms were not disclosed. The ownership group, led by people with deep roots in auto recycling, including the family offices of Tom D. Klauer Jr. and Kendig K. Kneen, is committing an additional $3 million to reengineer the platform, add new capabilities and return buying power to independent yards. Between the two, they have operated over 70 yards during the last three decades. “We have learned by operating our own yards that we can use the Crush software to teach our buyers to buy inventory that will yield far better results and thereby far more profits,” Klauer said.

 S3 has supported self-service auto recyclers for more than 15 years with Crush across the United States and Canada. With the acquisition, Crush Software Solutions will accelerate the roadmap for Crush 2.0. The company’s goal is to double the footprint to over 400 yards by delivering a modern, cloud-hosted, enterprise-ready system that improves vehicle sourcing, pricing, and sales.

 “Independent operators deserve technology that works for them. We are building Crush 2.0 to give yards more control over buying, inventory and margin,” said Klauer. “This investment will modernize the platform and remove friction from daily operations so teams can focus on throughput and customer experience.”

 “For current customers, nothing changes immediately. No disruption. Same highly secure platform. More investment,” said Gerontis. “This is an exciting time for the Crush community. The new funding lets us move faster on features, strengthen security and boost performance.”

 What improvements to expect with Crush 2.0

 * Complete re-engineering of the software with a modern cloud architecture
* Data-driven vehicle acquisition
* Integrated marketplace connections
* Enterprise-grade analytics and security

 The company’s near-term focus includes customer listening sessions, a transparent roadmap and early-access pilots in select markets.
