 The Jeep® Babes Enthusiast Club Michigan Chapter will gather from 9:00-Noon on Sunday, at Mugs Coffee & Grub, 330 Town Center Blvd, Unit D102, White Lake MI 48386 to collect items, including personal hygiene products, laundry baskets, and Meijer gift cards in an 18-foot trailer to donate to HAVEN, Michigan’s largest shelter and advocacy agency for survivors of intimate partner violence and sexual assault, offering services to men, women, children, and even their pets, regardless of location.

 At 12:00 Noon, a 50-vehicle convoy of Jeep® Babes will proceed to HAVEN Headquarters in Pontiac to present the donations, as well as funds raised through its annual Show and Shine charity event, where the Jeep® Babes teamed up with Birch Run Speedway on Saturday, September 19. All Show and Shine event proceeds are being donated to support HAVEN.

 Why: October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Although the overall number of reported domestic violence incidents in Michigan has declined in recent years, the cases have become more lethal. According to the Michigan State Police, 68,000 intimate partner violence incidents were reported in 2023.

 Between 2010 and 2022, reports decreased, yet fatalities from these incidents rose. Lifetime prevalence rates show that a significant portion of Michigan’s adult population has experienced IPV, with women disproportionately affected. Members of the LGBTQ+ community also report high levels of IPV.
