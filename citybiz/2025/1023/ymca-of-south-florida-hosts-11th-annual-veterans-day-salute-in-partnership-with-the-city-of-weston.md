# YMCA of South Florida Hosts 11th Annual Veterans Day Salute in Partnership with the City of Weston

The YMCA of South Florida, in partnership with the City of Weston, will honor former and current military members during its 11th annual Veterans Day Salute, presented by Milner Technologies, on Friday, November 7 from 8:30 to 11:00 a.m. at the Bonaventure Town Center Club, 16690 Saddle Club Road in Weston.

 This year’s keynote speaker is Robert O’Neill, a legendary Navy SEAL and decorated combat veteran who served for eight years on SEAL Team Six, where he led and participated in more than 400 missions around the world. His heroic contributions include rescuing Captain Richard Phillips from Somali pirates (as depicted in the now famous movie, Captain Phillips, starring Tom Hanks), aiding in the mission to save “Lone Survivor” Marcus Luttrell and leading the team that brought down Osama bin Laden. O’Neill has been awarded 53 military decorations, including two Silver Stars and four Bronze Stars with Valor.

 “Celebrating Veterans Day every year is very special for us, and we are honored to once again host this heartwarming salute to all military personnel and their families,” said YMCA of South Florida President and CEO Sheryl A. Woods. “This is an extraordinary celebration of the brave men and women, past and present, who serve our country.”

 

 More than 500 community leaders and veterans are expected to attend the Y’s annual Veterans Day breakfast. All veterans in attendance will receive a special gift that includes a challenge coin and more.

 According to data from the Florida Department of Veterans’ Affairs, nearly 10% of the nation’s 19.1 million veterans live in Florida, making it the third largest veteran population in the nation. The Y’s military connections in South Florida date back to World War I, and over the last six years, the YMCA of South Florida has provided more than $860,000 in financial assistance to military members. Through the Y’s military membership, families can spend quality time together, meet other military families and enjoy membership offerings in a supportive environment. Military benefits include opportunities for paid employment and as volunteers, facility usage for training purposes, health and wellness seminars and cross promotions of shared resources.
