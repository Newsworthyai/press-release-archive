# SNAP Benefits Uncertain: How Boca Helping Hands Will Help Plus Help for Federal Workers

Amidst the Federal government shutdown, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits may expire on October 31. Boca Helping Hands, which provides food, medical, and financial assistance to help individuals and families improve their quality of life and build financial stability, is committed to filling the gaps. Further, Boca Helping Hands is offering pantry bags to local federal employees who are impacted by the shutdown. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are roughly 7,100. Federal workers residing in Palm Beach County.

 “Come November 1, families who count on SNAP may find their benefits cut off, with devastating impact. Cuts to SNAP will disproportionately impact children, seniors and veterans, and our clientele have expressed deep concern,” said Dr. Andrew Hagen, Executive Director of Boca Helping Hands. “With our distribution centers, warehouses and refrigerated trucks, we have the infrastructure to fill the gap to ensure that these vulnerable populations do not go hungry. However, we are looking to the community to donate food that will quickly be distributed. Food drives from businesses, schools, places of worship, and other groups are most welcome.”

 According to the Florida Policy Institute, 2.9 million Floridians participate in SNAP, with average benefits of $6.12 per day. Children makeup 41 percent of SNAP’s caseload with seniors making up 25 percent, and 99,000 veterans participating in the program. According to the Palm Beach County Food Bank, more than 173,000 in the County are food insecure including one in five children.

Through its various programs, Boca Helping Hands assists nearly 35,000 people annually. Distributing food to the working poor from five distribution centers, the organization provides each year approximately 112,000 pantry bags, 73,000+ hot meals served and delivered. It also provides job training aimed at bringing individuals out of poverty.

 To donate food, please reach out to Bill Harper at bill@bocahelpinghands.org or call 561-417-0913.
