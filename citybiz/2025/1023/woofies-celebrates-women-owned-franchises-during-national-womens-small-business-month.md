# Woofie’s Celebrates Women-Owned Franchises During National Women’s Small Business Month

Co-Founder Amy Addington recognized as “Woman of Wonder” in October issue of Franchise Dictionary Magazine

 Woofie’s, the pet-care franchise known for its mobile pet grooming spa, dog walking, and pet sitting services, is celebrating its women‑owned franchises nationwide in honor of National Women’s Small Business Month. More than half of Woofie’s franchise owners are women and the corporate team is led by a strong female leadership bench.

 Adding to the celebration, Woofie’s Co‑Founder and President Amy Addington was named a “Woman of Wonder” by Franchise Dictionary Magazine in its October issue. Nominated by the publication’s readers—which number more than 450,000—honorees are recognized for their impact on franchising, ability to rise above challenges, and commitment to giving back to the community. Addington co‑founded Woofie’s in 2004, launched franchising in 2018, and has since grown the brand to 67 locations nationwide.

 Today, 43 Woofie’s locations are owned by women. See the complete list of women-owned Woofie’s. One of those owners, Crystal Witt, opened Woofie’s® of Greater Jacksonville with her husband, Neil Dakake. After being diagnosed with breast cancer, Witt decided to pursue her lifelong dream of entrepreneurship and demonstrate to her children the importance of building a life rooted in joy and fulfillment.

 “We have frequent interactions with local pet owners and feel like business ownership has deepened our relationship with our community,” Witt says. “The icing on the cake is getting to surround ourselves with pets just about every day!”

 Woofie’s of Reston-Herndon Owner Tanya Lee has grown to 10 office staff, 12 groomers and about 100 dog walkers and pet sitters. “All of them come from our local community so they know the people. They know the neighbors,” says Lee, who was recently featured in the International Franchise Association “Franchise Means Local” campaign and covered in Franchise Wire.

 In 2022, Woofie’s was ranked by Entrepreneur as a top franchise for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion and promotes diversity throughout the company and its franchise system. To help lower barriers to ownership, Woofie’s offers a $5,000 Diversity Discount on franchise fees for qualified minority‑owned, women‑owned, and LGBTQ+‑owned businesses.

 In addition to Addington, the brand is powered by talented female team members including:

 * Lydia Best – Vice President of Operations
* Jill Devlin – Franchise Development Manager
* Gabby Loielo – Franchise Business Consultant
* Jessica Koenig – Franchise Relations Specialist
* Caroline Murphy – Onboarding Operations Manager
* Jenises Negron – Lead National Talent Partner
* Kellie Notman – Marketing Manager

 “Helping women realize their dreams of entrepreneurship is really important to us at Woofie’s,” says Addington. “Every woman who steps into Woofie’s ownership strengthens our communities, creates jobs, and elevates the standard of care for pets and their people. We’re proud to foster a culture where women lead, innovate, and support one another—because when women thrive in business, everyone benefits.”
