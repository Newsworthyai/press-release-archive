# Harford Community Action Agency Receives Major Donation from Target Circle Community Giving Program

Thanks to the dedicated support of local Target shoppers, Harford Community Action Agency (HCAA) today announced it has received nearly $3,000 from the Target Circle Community Giving Program. The funds, which were awarded based on community votes from July – September, will directly support HCAA’s mission and support programs that address food insecurity, housing stability, mediation services, and emergency assistance for Harford County residents.

 “We’re so grateful to everyone who voted for the Harford Community Action Agency through the Target Circle program,” said HCAA CEO Pamela Craig. “Every vote and every dollar raised helps us continue our work to strengthen families and build a more resilient Harford County.”

 The Target Circle Community Giving Program allows Target guests to earn votes with every qualifying purchase and use those votes to help direct Target’s charitable giving to participating nonprofits in their community. The number of votes an organization receives determines the size of the grant.

 Harford Community Action Agency was selected as a featured nonprofit, engaging local shoppers who rallied behind the cause and cast their votes for the organization over the three-month period.
