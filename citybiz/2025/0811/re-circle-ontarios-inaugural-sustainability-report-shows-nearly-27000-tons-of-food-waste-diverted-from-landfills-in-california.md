# RE:CIRCLE Ontario’s Inaugural Sustainability Report Shows Nearly 27,000 Tons of Food Waste Diverted from Landfills in California

RE:CIRCLE Ontario, a RE:CIRCLE Solutions company and a leader in organic waste recycling, diversion strategies and feed production, today announced the publication of its inaugural sustainability report for full year 2024. The report details the company’s continued advancement of its environmental efforts in organic waste recycling in California to reduce landfill dependency and maximize resource recovery for grocery retailers, food and beverage producers and other key players in the food ecosystem to be compliant with state law.

 The U.S. foodservice industry spends an estimated $162 billion per year on wasted pre-consumer food which not only is a burden to industry but also to the environment. In addition, combined with high targets in California, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has announced domestic goals to reduce food loss and waste by 50% by 2030. These goals create a challenge for grocers, producers and retailers with regulatory compliance, but organics repurposing is the path to success.

 “We are thrilled to announce our inaugural sustainability report to showcase the enormous progress RE:CIRCLE Solutions has made in diverting waste from landfills,” said Clemens Stockreiter, Founder of RE:CIRCLE Solutions. “As a leader in organic waste management, we feel an immense responsibility to show to California the significant opportunities that exist to be more effective in sustainability efforts as well as the value that our innovative strategies can provide. We’re very pleased with the progress that we have made in achieving these key metrics which are the very foundation of our success, and we look forward to continuing our sustainability journey to promote a cleaner and healthier planet for all.”

 Key Highlights:

 * In 2024, RE:CIRCLE Ontario diverted approximately 27,000 metric tons from landfills and repurposed into recycled products such as animal feed, biofuel, and other sustainable outputs.
* The company’s operations generated a total of 1,781 metric tons of CO₂e in 2024, comprising:  Scope 1 (direct emissions): 597 metric tons Scope 2 (indirect emissions from purchased energy): 33 metric tons Scope 3 (other indirect emissions): 1,151 metric tons
