 Could you tell us a bit about your professional journey leading up to your role as Chief Product Officer at Sauce Labs, and what attracted you to the company?

 I joined Sauce Labs as Chief Product Officer in June 2024, bringing with me a career that began in product management on mobile application platforms for pre-iPhone-era sync devices such as the Palm Pilot and Blackberry. The most exciting aspect of that early work was digitizing paper-based processes, which enabled richer data collection and faster decision-making. AI wasn’t what it is today, but the data we gathered laid the foundation for future innovation.

 I then joined Cisco, working on Cisco TelePresence, an in-person video conferencing product. Following Cisco’s acquisition of WebEx—one of the first cloud/SaaS companies—I led its integration into TelePresence, enabling users to join meetings seamlessly from either a conference room or their laptops. This was the precursor to Zoom. Over the next 11 years, I led multiple product teams delivering mobile video, collaboration apps, and developer platforms and tools.

 Next, I moved to AWS, where I worked on S3 Storage and EC2 Compute during the peak of enterprise-wide cloud adoption. This period also accelerated the rise of cloud data lakes for big data analytics and AI/ML, transforming how I thought about data. Data is the oil that powers applications—enabling personalized user experiences and providing critical insights for product and engineering teams to build the right product efficiently and cost-effectively.

 After AWS, I led two very different products—Twilio Flex, a customizable cloud contact-center platform, and Medable, a data- and AI-powered platform to digitize clinical trials. Despite their differences, both leveraged data and AI to solve complex problems.

 Today, Sauce Labs is navigating another industry transition as a mission-critical platform that helps DevOps teams build and release products with speed, reliability, and confidence.

 Given the rapidly evolving landscape of software testing, what are the most significant innovations or product developments Sauce Labs is focusing on right now?

 This may not come as a surprise, but today, if you are a company in the software development and testing space, AI and automation are key drivers of innovation, efficiency, and competitive advantage. Every product roadmap must demonstrate value for customers that is driven by continuous advancements in GenAI. Our customers have trusted us to drive testing execution across their application development journey, with over 8 billion tests executed over the years. Sauce Labs is uniquely positioned to deliver a robust, data-driven platform and unmatched AI-powered solutions tailored to each customer’s distinct needs.

 The first truly unique value we are launching is Sauce AI Insights. It uses this data to enable insights and automation across many time-consuming workflows for QA and release teams, saving them hours every day. It can automatically unearth test failure patterns across platforms, test suites, or modules, as well as detect changes in software behavior over time. Sauce AI Insights delivers data-driven quality for customers, turning test data into actionable insights so engineering leaders can prioritize what matters, catch issues earlier, and drive continuous quality.

 In addition, we are adding a natural-language-based AI Assistant so customers can streamline decision-making and accelerate quality simply by asking questions in plain English.

 How have recent trends in DevOps, CI/CD, and digital transformation influenced your product roadmap and priorities?

 AI-driven automation and intelligence are fundamentally transforming how customers evolve their DevOps and CI/CD processes, playing a critical role in accelerating digital transformation. AI and machine learning are now embedded across the entire software delivery lifecycle—from build and test to deployment and monitoring. This enables integrated security and compliance earlier in the development cycle, enhancing speed, reliability, and incident resolution.

 A key priority on our product roadmap is to simplify integration and automation across modern CI/CD and AIOps tools, empowering platform engineering teams to do more while streamlining and consolidating their DevOps toolchains. Today, our platform enables seamless CI/CD integration and automated testing. Looking ahead, full-stack integrations combined with unified DevOps and MLOps workflows—plus observability powered by AI—will further drive governance, traceability, and operational efficiency.

 In your experience, what are the biggest challenges customers face with testing and continuous delivery, and how does Sauce Labs address them?

 Today, product and technology leaders are looking to ease the pain of delivering quality products cost-effectively while offering critical digital experiences to consumers and businesses alike. Further, AI is fundamentally transforming every aspect of enterprise software development—automating complex tasks from coding and testing to deployment, accelerating decision-making through data insights, and enabling the creation of more intelligent, adaptive, and personalized applications.

 There is also a paradigm shift in application user interfaces, with human-tech interaction evolving from a fixed web or mobile interface to a dynamic Agentic AI interface. Agentic flows are driving explosive growth in agent-to-LLM model and data interactions, with the rise of open interoperability standards like MCP Servers. As these agentic workflows evolve, the definition of software quality is changing to address the added layers of risk they pose for businesses.

 At Sauce Labs, as the leader in quality assurance trusted by the world’s top brands, our vision is to empower innovation and enable confidence for the applications of today and the AI-driven workflows of tomorrow.

 We are focused on delivering an end-to-end, platform-centric approach to quality that supports all major test frameworks and technologies out of the box. This approach brings together real-time quality data, provides AI-enabled insights on what to do next, and uses AI to significantly increase engineering efficiency devoted to quality.

 This empowers developers early in the SDLC as well as application owners late in the release cycle, leveraging the most performant and scalable global network of physical and virtual mobile and desktop devices for real-world testing, along with the best tools for beta testing with real users, and for tracking failure analytics in production.

 What steps do you take to foster a product culture that encourages collaboration, creativity, and user-centric thinking among your teams?

 A thriving, collaborative product culture is built on a foundation of vision, deep customer empathy, transparency, and empowerment. As a product leader, a big part of my role is to define a compelling customer-centric vision, enable shared understanding of that vision across functional teams, and empower teams to drive execution around it.

 We align our OKRs at the company level and cascade them to teams. It is an iterative process, with an important focus on the “why” behind each objective and ensuring a clear, measurable impact. Product, engineering, and design triads use a continuous discovery cycle for each new capability they add to the roadmap, which empowers them to experiment as they iterate on solutions.

 An area of experimentation we emphasized last year was learning and applying GenAI tools for both internal and customer needs. At Sauce, we prioritize user-centricity by actively sharing customer learnings from user research, direct conversations, and indirect insights—both in written form and during monthly customer roundtables embedded in our team meetings. Teams also have access to extensive business intelligence and product data to deeply understand customer needs and make informed decisions.

 Personally, it’s important to model these behaviors daily—embedding user focus into every decision—and consistently championing a culture that values curiosity, experimentation, and creating real impact for customers.

 As an industry veteran, what advice would you offer to emerging product leaders, especially those looking to drive innovation at scale?

 My advice to emerging product leaders is simple. It’s easy to get lost in complex frameworks and working models, but when it comes to building great, innovative products, a few basics have not changed—even in this AI era.

 Always obsess over the problem, not the solution. Innovation begins with a deep understanding of the problem space. Too often, teams rush into building without truly validating the need. Most concepts and ideas are good, but the great ones start from the problem to be solved. Talk to your customers. Talk to your users. Go deep into the problem—how they solve it today and what makes it hard for them—to build the right solution.

 Great, innovative products are not just about features and functions. True innovation at scale requires repeatability and building scalable systems and solutions, rather than one-off features or customizations for a single customer.

 I’m a strong advocate for data-driven decisions, but data should not override intuition, vision, or qualitative insights.

 Lastly, the most important tool in a product leader’s toolbox is ruthless prioritization. Time, talent, and resources are finite in every organization, and chasing too many initiatives dilutes impact.
