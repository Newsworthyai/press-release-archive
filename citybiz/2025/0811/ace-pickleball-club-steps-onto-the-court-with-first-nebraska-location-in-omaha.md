# Ace Pickleball Club Steps Onto the Court with First Nebraska Location in Omaha

Ace Pickleball Club, a national pickleball franchise, recently opened its first Nebraska location in Omaha. Located at 13423 F St, the new Ace Pickleball Club (APC) will cater to the growing demand for pickleball locally, offering Members the flexibility to play whenever their schedule allows for a flat monthly Membership fee. No more competing to reserve a spot – Ace Pickleball Club’s offering of open play all day, every day lets Members get their games in without the hassle of coordinating with others, or any additional fees.

 Ace Pickleball Club – Omaha is owned by husband-and-wife duo, Liz and Michael Tanji. The couple met while serving in the US Army. After their military service, Liz pursued a successful career in accounting, while Michael built his own career in cybersecurity.

 The Tanjis were drawn to Ace Pickleball Club not just because of their love for the game but also because of their respect for the leadership team and the Club’s innovative approach. They appreciated that Ace is fully dedicated to pickleball, creating an inclusive space for everyone from seasoned players to complete beginners.

 As the sport continues to grow and access to public courts remains limited, the Tanjis saw a real opportunity to bring something special to Omaha. They often heard people say they wanted to learn how to play but did not know where to start. That made Ace’s Pickleball 101 classes a major selling point, offering new players a welcoming place to learn the basics and build confidence.

 “Pickleball truly is a sport for everyone, and we’re thrilled to introduce even more people to the game with our new location,” said Liz. “Whether you’re picking up a paddle for the first time or looking to sharpen your skills, Ace Pickleball Club is the perfect place to jump in, have fun, and connect with others.”

 Ace Pickleball Club prioritizes its Members, delivering a seamless and optimal playing experience with state-of-the-art facilities and cushioned professional-grade courts. Unlike other Clubs, APC offers simplified Membership model with a single monthly payment, similar to a traditional gym to allow for a hassle-free experience for every age and skill level. At APC, Members become part of a fun and inclusive community filled with unlimited open play, clinics, Club-coordinated tournaments, social events, and court and ball machine reservations. With unlimited paddle demos included, Members can test out all of the newest paddles from a wide variety of brands to find their favorite. New to the sport? Ace Pickleball Club – Omaha will offer free introductory pickleball clinics to go over the rules of the sport and feel more comfortable as they learn about the game.
