# Q&amp;A with Vibeke Gwendoline Faengsrud, Founder and CEO of House of Math

Vibeke Gwendoline Faengsrud is the founder and CEO of House of Math, Norway’s largest private math education company and a fast‑growing global EdTech platform. Once a homeless high school student who failed math, she transformed her academic trajectory by starting over from fourth‑grade concepts, methodically filling every knowledge gap until she earned a master’s degree in mathematical finance. Known as “The Math Woman,” Faengsrud has authored 27 books covering the full K–12 math curriculum, developed innovative teaching methods grounded in neuroscience and gamification, and built a proven mastery‑based system that has helped millions of students go from confused to confident. In 2025, she was named Tech Star of the Year at Norway’s HER Awards, selected from over 2,000 nominees and 70,000 public votes.

 Now based in Palo Alto, Faengsrud has brought House of Math to the U.S. to help reverse declining math scores, close achievement gaps, and tackle rising math anxiety. The platform offers personalized AI guidance, gamified learning environments, and a comprehensive K–12 curriculum designed to fill gaps before moving forward — a philosophy shaped by Faengsrud’s own journey. Her mission is clear: to dismantle the “math brain” myth, prove that math is a skill anyone can learn, and ensure no student is left behind.

 Your personal journey is remarkable — from failing high school math to founding Norway’s largest private math education company. Can you share how that experience shaped your vision for House of Math?

 Absolutely. House of Math is all about giving everyone a real chance at mastering math. We’ve built a platform where anyone — regardless of background, ability, or past struggles — can access a proven method that lifts your math confidence and helps you succeed.

 Our belief is simple but powerful: “Knowledge empowers people and strengthens society.” This isn’t just another math platform. It’s a movement — a mission to unlock potential, close gaps, and make math accessible, joyful, and empowering for all.

 Because when you master math, you don’t just change your grades — you change your future.

 I failed math my junior year of high school — and had to repeat the year. From the outside, I looked like someone who just wasn’t “a math person.” But I knew it wasn’t me — I just hadn’t been given the right method or the right mindset. No one had ever helped me figure out how to do this math stuff, and I was too young to figure it out on my own. At the time, my gaps were the size of meteor craters.

 So I made a decision: I went back as far as I needed to start all over. For me, that meant returning to fourth-grade content — filling every single gap. I’ve been asked several times what made me think I could do it. The answer is simple: I never felt I had really given it a try. I was too scared because maybe I wouldn’t be able to — and then I’d have proof that I was stupid. I believed in the “idiot math myths” as so many of us do. But I don’t anymore, because I know better.

 Going all the way back to fourth grade and rebuilding from the ground up was the smartest thing I’ve ever done. No shortcuts. No skipping steps. Just systematic, consistent work. That decision changed everything and has become the basis for everything House of Math is today. I didn’t just pass math — I went on to earn a master’s degree, write curriculum books for all 13 years of Norwegian school math, and become known as “The Math Woman.”

 So when people say, “I’m just not good at math,” I say: neither was I — until I decided to do the work. Math isn’t about talent; it’s about having the right method, the right mindset, and the willingness to keep showing up. Like I say: Math is not a code to crack — it’s a recipe to follow.

 That belief — that anyone can learn math if they’re willing to do the job — is what House of Math is built on. It’s not a privilege. It’s a skill. And it’s for everyone.

 House of Math has been a success in Norway for nearly 20 years. Why did you feel now was the right time to expand to the U.S.?

 Because the need has never been clearer. PISA scores are declining, and math is now a necessary skill for everyone — not just math teachers and engineers.

 At the same time, math anxiety is at an all-time high, and the achievement gap is widening. It’s not a lack of talent — it’s a lack of access to the right method. We believe every student deserves a way to learn math that is motivating and built for mastery.

 After nearly two decades of building and refining the methods at House of Math in Norway, we’ve created a system that works every time — as long as you follow it. We’ve helped students go from confused to confident. And now, with AI and tech infrastructure evolving rapidly, we finally have the tools to scale this impact globally.

 The U.S. is the right place, and this is the right moment. We’re here to show that with the right tools and support, math can be for everyone. And we’re here to help everyone who is willing to give it a try.

 What sets House of Math apart from other math learning platforms already available to students in the U.S.?

 At House of Math, we’re not just teaching math — we’re transforming how students experience it. While most platforms stop at curriculum delivery, we go several steps further, combining neuroscience, gamification, AI, and mastery-based learning to create a system that actually works.

 First, we cover the entire 12-year journey — from early elementary through high school graduation — and give students full access to all grade levels, all the time. Whether they want to move ahead, need more time on a concept, review something from three years ago, or catch up after a move or illness, nothing breaks their learning track. They’re always supported, at their own pace, with full access and overview.

 Second, we’re solving what Benjamin Bloom famously called the two-sigma problem: students who receive one-on-one, mastery-based tutoring perform two standard deviations better than those in traditional classrooms. At House of Math, we’re building a scalable system that replicates this one-on-one effect for every learner through personalized AI guidance, adaptive progression, and formative feedback — all while making it gamified.

 We also focus deeply on filling knowledge gaps before pushing into new curriculum. This is where most systems fail — and where we thrive. Every learning path starts with a mapping quiz that tailors the experience to the individual, and our AI Oracle is available 24/7 to answer any question with step-by-step explanations and custom video support. We help students build real competence to progress and get that grade.

 And we’re a true one-stop shop. Students get everything in one place: personalized learning track, explainer videos, step-by-step AI help, a full math encyclopedia, tons of interactive exercises, and fully gamified learning environments that reward progress and spark motivation.

 We’ve already helped students succeed for two decades in Norway. Now we’re bringing that proven model to the U.S. — empowering students to master math!

 You often talk about busting the ‘math brain’ myth — the belief that some people simply aren’t wired for math. Why is dismantling that misconception so important to you and your work?

 I flunked math in my junior year of high school — actually, I did junior year twice. And yet, I went on to earn a master’s degree in mathematics and write books that cover the entire K–12 math curriculum in Norway. Somewhere along the way, I became known as The Math Woman — the one who went from failing math to mastering it.

 Let me be clear: I did not get a brain transplant. What I did do was go back to fourth grade and start filling in every single knowledge gap I had. Math isn’t a code to crack; it’s a recipe to follow. But like any recipe, it only works if you follow it — no skipping steps, no shortcuts, no pretending you can wing it. You can’t.

 Here’s what happens: people try to learn math, do their homework, follow the curriculum — but still struggle. And instead of realizing the issue is a quilt of knowledge gaps, they start looking for explanations. That’s when the myths kick in:

 “I’m just not a math person.”

 “We’re not a math family.”

 “Math is only for the smart.”

 “If you’re good at math, you must be a genius — and if you’re bad, you must be stupid.”

 Or the classic: “I won’t need this stuff anyway.”

 It’s just nonsense. All of it. Math is for everyone — if you approach it the right way. You have to be willing to go backwards to move the fastest way forwards. Remember, I went all the way back to fourth grade, and that’s where I started studying for my master’s in math. I actually started studying theoretical mathematics without knowing how to do fractions. I don’t recommend that journey to anyone! However, it led me to develop this platform so no one else has to go through that. Always a silver lining!

 What breaks my heart is that people internalize these struggles. They think they’re stupid. They’re not. But math has this way of creeping into your identity. It sticks — and it spills a lack of self-belief over into other areas of life. That’s why we have to change the narrative. People need to understand: there is a way forward. There is a method. And it works: fill the gaps, follow the recipe, and succeed at math.

 I’ve helped countless students go from failing to thriving — just by following the recipe. And now, I’m here to share it with everyone.

 You’re platform combines gamification, AI, and personalized learning. How do these innovations help students overcome math anxiety and build confidence?

 Math anxiety is real — it actually lights up the brain’s pain centers. It’s a neurological barrier to learning. At House of Math, we’ve built a platform that turns math fear into math flow. By combining gamification, AI, and personalized learning, we’ve created a learning experience grounded in neuroscience, didactics, and psychology — designed to build confidence and mastery. It’s built to give everyone a chance at mastering math!

 Did you know that gamification releases dopamine by tapping into the brain’s reward system? When people experience something pleasurable or achieve a goal, this reward center is activated. The benefits include lowering stress and making students more open to learning. Never underestimate the positive power of gamification — it can truly motivate students to do more math, giving them a higher chance of mastering it.

 Another important aspect is our AI Oracle. Students can ask any math question and get step-by-step explanations and videos — without fear of failure, judgment, or ridicule. It also offers continuous feedback, which we know is one of the fastest ways to learn.

 This combination of tech is a carefully crafted learning system that works with the brain, for motivation and with the student. When students feel supported and in control, confidence grows — and that’s when real learning accelerates.

 You’ve authored 27 math books and developed curriculum guides for all ages. How have those resources informed the design and philosophy behind House of Math’s digital platform?

 It has been pivotal. The feedback from readers — like “finally I understand algebra” or people saying the books were so sought after they sold on the equivalent of Craigslist when they were out of print — means a lot to me.

 My books are written differently, and that has upset some academics. They’re written in the “I” form, as if I’m talking directly to you. They have recipes, hints, and subchapters that are never more than two pages, so every time you turn the page, a new topic awaits.

 To use this structure, I had to dismantle math into its smallest parts — we call it atomic learning — and keep a tight structure to stay on topic. I love that I went against all the “correct” ways of doing it, and it worked like a charm. I wasn’t surprised, since this is the essence of the method I’ve seen work for a decade, but it was still really cool to see it succeed in book form. That gave me confidence it would work on a digital platform too.

 As a woman founder in both tech and education, what unique challenges have you faced in building and scaling House of Math?

 Being a woman in tech, people have a tendency to underestimate you — and the wrong people think, “I’ll handle her.” Let’s just say several have been surprised.

 I’ve also felt the need to emphasize that I’m not having children, so investors don’t worry about me disappearing if I got pregnant.

 And being a woman who says, “I know how everyone can learn math — my method will take anyone who follows it to the top” — that’s created a stir. It’s not really important, because the method works, but the education industry is ancient and doesn’t handle disruption well. It moves slowly — which it should, because it’s the development ground for every generation. But I like to hold two thoughts at once: disruption and slowness don’t have to be mutually exclusive. It depends on the point of entry.

 What advice would you give to other women looking to lead or launch companies in the EdTech or STEM sectors?

 Be prepared — the journey is going to be way worse than you can imagine. But if you’re made of the right fabric, it’s going to be worth it.

 There are no handouts, and people will be gunning for you. All the systemic biases you read about in research papers? They’ll be magnified beyond belief when you choose to take such a visible role.

 On the other hand, having the privilege to build a company and pave the way for women coming up behind you is incredibly rewarding. And creating partnerships and friendships with men and women across the globe who want to build with you? That’s fun beyond words.

 You started House of Math as a one-woman tutoring service — what lessons from those early days have stayed with you as you’ve scaled to an international business?

 I decided that whatever my clients needed, I would deliver. I was at their homes at 5:30 a.m., tutoring before school. I rushed out to desperate students at midnight, sitting with them before a big test into the early hours. I traveled to London, Edinburgh, Monaco, LA, and San Francisco — as well as spending my whole summer at their cabins — all to make sure they reached their goals.

 By always saying “yes,” “I’ll fix it,” “I’ll deliver the results” — and then doing it — I secured my first round of funding when I decided to build an EdTech company. My clients had seen me deliver results for a decade, pull solutions out of a hat they didn’t think were possible, and stay relentless in delivering what they needed. It paid off when I wanted to build a global math learning platform and give everyone access to the system they knew could deliver the top grade.

 For parents and educators in the U.S. who are worried about falling math scores, what would you say are the most common mistakes we make in how we approach teaching math?

 The most common mistake is thinking kids can learn new math on a foundation full of gaps. Math is treacherous in that every new step builds on what came before.

 Our biggest mistake is asking kids to do homework and study for tests when we should first ask them to fill their gaps — so they can actually do the homework and study effectively.

 I always say: the fastest way forward in mathematics is to move backward. Did you know that fractions are the single most destructive math gap? If you don’t master fractions, you can’t master ratios, probability, geometry, algebra, equations, functions, limits, derivatives, integration — and the list goes on.

 You must fill your gaps to master math. There’s no way around it.

 You’ve said that gaps in knowledge, especially around fractions, are one of the biggest barriers to math success. How does House of Math help students identify and fix those gaps?

 That is my favorite question! Let’s break it down.

 In U.S. schools, students start learning fractions around age 8–9. Fractions are the first abstract math topic they encounter, because they don’t translate directly to the number line like integers. Two is smaller than three — but ½ is not smaller than ⅓. What is going on?!

 In comparison, the human brain is said to be able to understand abstract concepts from age 11–12. So, best case scenario, students are expected to grasp abstract thinking for three years before their brains are developmentally ready.

 School research shows the big math drop-off starts in fifth grade — and it’s widely accepted that fractions are the reason. From there, the gaps created spill into every topic that follows, forming a “quilt” of missing knowledge. Many students then work hard at math without seeing results to match their effort. It’s devastating, demotivating, and frustrating.

 If there were a system that could map you without killing your soul with hour-long tests, your math life would be much easier. And that’s exactly what we’ve created with our proprietary AI MIND — Mathematical Intelligence and Navigation Domain. We can map a student with a qualitative test that takes minutes and learn enough to create the optimal mastery track.

 Fill the gaps. Follow the recipe. Get the grade.

 What’s your long-term vision for House of Math in the U.S. — where do you hope to be in five years?

 Become the No. 1 math resource globally. I want to help everyone master math. There is no reason to leave anyone behind!
