 Can you tell us a little bit about American Innovators Network and how your group benefits businesses and entrepreneurs in Maryland and across the country?

 American Innovators Network, or AIN, is a coalition comprised of little tech entrepreneurs, startups, firms, and innovators, that works actively to create an environment where our nation’s innovators are supported and uplifted, rather than disabled and shut down.

 We do this by advocating state by state for fair laws and regulations as they pertain to creativity, new ideas, and new technologies like artificial intelligence to encourage economic growth.

 For those who may not know, can you elaborate on what exactly “Little Tech” is? How would you define that term?

 Sure, we define “Little Tech” as smaller companies, businesses, organizations, and entrepreneurs, who are actively competing with “Big Tech”, or highly established companies, for a fighting chance.

 There are plenty of rules and regulations supporting and enabling the work of “Big Tech” companies, while “Little Tech” companies are often left without a seat at the table, engulfed by policies that work against them and snuff out their creativity and potential for growth.

 

 We understand that there are regulations being proposed and considered at both the National and Local level. How do you feel about this?

 To be frank, I feel disappointed. It’s clear when going through proposed national and local regulations that “Little Tech” companies and leaders have not been consulted.

 Any form of proposed regulation on the matter makes me hopeful for a future where “Little Tech” and “Big Tech” companies work together to influence safe and fair regulations that give room for innovation to grow. However, when smaller and less established entrepreneurs aren’t consulted for their perspective on the matter, that leaves room for overregulation, the hindering of ideas, and increases already tight margins for those who would be directly impacted.

 What are some unique challenges that Maryland entrepreneurs, and small tech entrepreneurs as a whole, face in today’s innovation economy?

 There are lots of challenges that entrepreneurs actively face, both in Maryland and across America – and like I mentioned previously, it all starts with a lack of consultation. By that I mean, the same established businesses are influencing policy, yet those who are directly going to be impacted are left out of the conversation.

 Overregulation is incredibly prevalent when it comes to innovative technology like artificial intelligence. By imposing strict regulations, smaller companies are unable to progress their ideas when it comes to newer technologies and how they might impact the economic landscape around them.

 Maryland specifically has recently enacted a 3% tech tax, worrying local entrepreneurs as it will negatively impact already strict margins and tight funding.

 Can you tell us a bit about how policymakers can better support “Little Tech” at the state and federal levels?

 Policymakers can support our entrepreneurs by hearing their voices, crafting fair and responsible policies, and keeping the conversation going. Economic growth across the country, and locally in states like Maryland, depends on the innovation of businesses and brainstorming new ideas.

 Finally, where can Maryland’s small businesses and “Little Tech” entrepreneurs go if they’d like to learn more and join your coalition?
