# Q&amp;A with Jared Klee, Head of Revenue at Bastion

Jared Klee is the newly appointed Head of Revenue at Bastion, a regulated digital asset and stablecoin infrastructure and NYDFS chartered provider. He brings a wealth of experience across blockchain, fintech and startup ecosystems, having previously served as Head of Sales at Vouch, a Series D insurtech firm, where he launched the company’s Web3 practice.

 Jared also co-founded Triple Point Liquidity, a blockchain-based fintech startup, and held key roles at IBM, including leading Digital Assets at IBM Blockchain and founding the Watson Risk & Compliance platform. At Bastion, he will oversee the company’s revenue strategy, driving growth and scaling go-to-market efforts amid rising demand for enterprise-grade crypto solutions.

 You’ve held leadership roles across blockchain, fintech, and enterprise tech. What drew you to Bastion at this specific moment?

 The digital assets industry is at an inflection point. After nearly a decade in this space, from early regulatory efforts to building and scaling Web3 practices, I’ve never been more excited about the future.

 Bastion is delivering on a key promise that’s been years in the making – stablecoins. The opportunity to make money digitally native and everything that entails – programmable, moveable, seamlessly transferable – it’s the infrastructure that will power the next generation of financial systems. And to do it with a team that’s already executing at the highest level, made this an easy decision.

 What cryptocurrency trends are you watching most closely and what are you most excited for right now?

 Stablecoins are the most exciting trend in crypto right now. For the first time ever, we can program money movement. It’s transformational for everything from finance operations to payments. And it’s reshaping how we think about crypto – we’re seeing a maturation from consumer wallets to enterprise use cases, and the implications are massive.

 Passage of the GENIUS has already created even more opportunity. Now with the regulatory clarity at the federal level that the industry has been seeking, enterprises are moving from experimentation to implementation.

 I’m closely watching the evolution of stablecoins. It’s like living in a black-and-white world and then someone flips a switch to color. The ability to automate treasury operations, payments, and liquidity management through smart contacts is a game changer. Branded stablecoins are rising in popularity, for instance. Enterprises have a whole new experimentation space to make new, never before seen capabilities available to their customers. They’re rapidly experimenting with economics of every dollar in their ecosystems, earning yield on reserve assets, and building novel forms of loyalty and network effects.

 How has your experience at IBM and Vouch shaped your approach to scaling in a fast-moving space like digital assets?

 Fast moving, first of a kind building is never the same twice but it often rhymes. At IBM, I did it leading and alongside extraordinary teams that broke through the AI winter, used AI to help banks solve their thorniest risk and compliance challenges after 2008, and powered global consortia with the first enterprise blockchains. At Vouch, I did it helping develop an entirely new crypto insurance industry that now offers crypto-specific protections for risks unique to the space.

 When there’s no playbook because it hasn’t been done before, you have to build tremendous trust with those you’re working with: your team, your clients, and your partners. And it all has to hang together. If you’re going to work with household name enterprises like we do at Bastion, you need a team and partners who have been-there done-that before and have shared beliefs that the right way is the compliant way, the secure way. It’s about focusing the innovation on the pieces that are really going to matter and derisking everywhere else.

 How do you see the role of crypto infrastructure providers like Bastion evolving as enterprise adoption of stablecoins and digital assets gains traction?

 Infrastructure providers like Bastion are playing two roles: we’re becoming the connective tissue between legacy finance and the digital asset ecosystem and we’re unlocking entirely new experimentation space for natively digital money movement that’s never been possible before. As enterprises adopt stablecoins and crypto products, they need partners who can deliver secure, compliant, and scalable solutions. They don’t need to do everything themselves – to do that would require an incredible investment of time and money to build their own crypto products independently. Working with a partner that has the technology and license in place will help enterprises move quickly on this opportunity.

 Bastion is uniquely positioned here – we’re NYDFS-trust-chartered, deeply integrated with traditional systems, and focused on enabling real-time, programmable financial operations. Our role is to make crypto infrastructure invisible but indispensable, and simple to scale for the world’s largest businesses.

 The cryptocurrency industry is becoming more competitive as demand rises. What sets Bastion apart from other providers in the market?

 The team and the focus. You’d be hard-pressed to find a more experienced team across every major function from legal and compliance to engineering and finance. And we’ve been maniacally focused on enterprise needs since day one. We combine regulatory rigor with technical excellence, offering everything from fiat on-off ramps to branded stablecoin issuance, all underpinned by a robust risk and compliance framework. Our NYDFS trust charter not only gives us a unique edge in trust and credibility, it’s future-proofed for the next era of stablecoin regulation under the GENIUS Act.

 How is Bastion positioning itself to serve enterprise clients at scale as stablecoin and crypto infrastructure accelerates?

 We’re investing heavily in scalable, secure infrastructure that meets the needs of the world’s largest enterprises. Bastion has been ready for the stablecoin industry boom that we’re seeing now, and our product philosophy has always been laser focused on compliance, security, liquidity and efficiency. As a licensed provider we handle compliance, custody, and infrastructure so enterprises don’t need their own licenses to launch crypto products at scale.

 We’re also expanding our go-to-market capabilities to meet rising demand, and building a world-class team to support our clients every step of the way.

 What role do you see stablecoins playing for enterprises in the future?

 We’re at the start of a multidecade transformation. You can still find corners of business where the internet hasn’t made much of an impact yet, but they’re becoming more and more scarce. We’ll look back on stablecoins with the same “it must have seemed inevitable” mindset. They’re going to become pervasive.

 Stablecoins offer unmatched speed, transparency, and cost-effectiveness for every aspect of money movement. But more importantly, they unlock new capabilities, such as automated liquidity management, cross-border payments without intermediaries, and real-time treasury operations. Regulation is finally catching up and infrastructure is beginning to mature. Soon stablecoins won’t just be an alternative, they’ll be the default for many enterprises.
