# DC BLOX Lands $1.15 Billion Green Loan to Develop Atlanta Data Center Campus

DC BLOX, a leading provider of connected data center and fiber network solutions across the Southeastern United States, today announced it has closed $1.15 billion in green loan financing for the construction of a data center campus in Douglas County, Georgia, designed to meet the demands of cloud and AI workloads. The funds will support the development of a 120 MW data center and include campus expansion to support an additional 80 MW, available as early as 2027.

 “Securing this capital confirms confidence in our execution track record,” stated Melih Ileri, SVP of Capital Markets & Strategy at DC BLOX. “Continuing to deliver our projects on-time and with excellence has earned us the trust of our customers and investors, leading to this historic growth in our business.”

 This project comes on the heels of recently announced DC BLOX projects including multiple hyperscale edge nodes across the Southeast. With additional hyperscale-ready data center capacity available in Conyers, Georgia and Douglasville, Georgia, DC BLOX is set to rapidly expand its presence around Atlanta.

 “With this latest project announcement, DC BLOX continues to deliver on its mission to build the foundational digital infrastructure needed to drive the Southeast’s growing economy,” said Jeff Uphues, CEO of DC BLOX. “Atlanta is the fastest-growing data center market in the US today, and we are proud to enable our customers to expand their footprint in our region.”

 This financing follows the prior $265 million green loan secured from leading industry lenders, as well as the growth equity that was committed by Post Road Group in the fourth quarter of 2024. DC BLOX is now well positioned to meet the rapidly growing digital infrastructure demand fueled by hyperscaler expansion.

 “The DC BLOX management team has done a terrific job positioning the business for success in the Southeast with a consistent focus on serving the customer and community,” stated Michael Bogdan, Managing Partner at Post Road Group. “We are thankful to all our capital partners who have helped capitalize the company to meet the tremendous hyperscale and edge growth the company has experienced.”
