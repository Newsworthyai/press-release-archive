# Q&amp;A with Scott Douglas, Founder of Douglas Commerical

Scott Douglas brings over 16 years of commercial real estate experience to Douglas Commercial. Since founding the company in January of 2007 he has handled over $200 Million in sales and leasing transaction value.

 Scott specializes in both sales and leasing and has represented both local and national companies across a broad spectrum of industries including technology, professional services, biotech, insurance and retail, primarily in the Baltimore-Washington Corridor. Prior to starting Douglas Commercial, Scott served as Senior Real Estate Advisor for Corridor Reznick, a Regional Commercial Real Estate firm in Baltimore. Prior to Corridor Reznick, Scott started his career in commercial real estate with Hyatt Commercial in Annapolis.

 Scott resides in Annapolis, MD. When he is not in the office working or helping clients he can be found on the tennis court or golf course.

 Tell us about your journey into commercial real estate. What initially drew you into the industry?

 I began my career in accounting, working in the tax division at Arthur Andersen. From there, I became CFO of a printing company. After merging with another company whose CFO had more experience, I was encouraged to consider a role in sales—a move that turned out to be a perfect fit.

 Sales proved to be an exciting and rewarding profession, but over time, the printing industry became increasingly competitive and profit margins continued to shrink. I knew it was time for a change.

 Having owned rental properties for years, I’d always been intrigued by real estate. I decided to get my license and joined a local firm in Annapolis. After two years with a regional firm in Baltimore, I founded Douglas Commercial in January 2007—and have never looked back.

 How is Douglas Commercial positioned to capitalize on 1031 exchanges?

 Our approach is twofold:

 1. Off-Market Seller Outreach – We work directly with property owners to help them understand the tax advantages of 1031 exchanges.
2. Passive Investment Solutions – For clients seeking a hands-off approach, we offer Delaware Statutory Trusts (DSTs), which provide fractional ownership in institutional-grade commercial real estate.

 This combination allows us to deliver tailored solutions that meet both active and passive investor needs.

 Please highlight some of your recent transactions?

 1. DST Portfolio for Retirees – A client was selling her family’s investment property. She and her husband were ready to retire and travel, so they wanted a completely passive investment. We advised them on a DST portfolio of three properties that met their income and diversification goals.
2. Opportunity Zone Investment – A client sold his business and wanted to defer capital gains. We guided him into a Qualified Opportunity Zone investment, allowing him to defer taxes until April 15, 2027—and if he holds the asset for 10 years, he will never pay capital gains on its appreciation.

 What makes your approach different from competitors?

 Most commercial real estate brokers focus solely on selling their client’s property in a 1031 exchange (“the front leg”), while financial advisors handle the majority of DST sales for replacement properties in a 1031 exchange (“the back leg”). By holding both a commercial real estate license and a securities license, I’m able to guide clients through both legs of the exchange. This creates a seamless, one-stop solution.

 What investor challenges are you particularly good at solving?

 Commercial real estate transactions almost always come with unexpected challenges. My strength lies in anticipating potential obstacles early and developing creative, practical solutions quickly—keeping deals moving forward and protecting my clients’ interests.

 How do you see the CRE industry performing for the rest of this year?

 Barring any major unforeseen events, I believe the CRE market will finish the year strong. Certain sectors may continue to face headwinds, but demand for quality investment properties remains healthy.

 What are you currently working on?

 We’re actively involved in several development deals and expanding our 1031 exchange division. Recently, we hosted our first 1031 exchange seminar, which was a great success, and we plan to offer these regularly.

 What are your long-term aspirations for the company?

 We aim to build a 21st-century brokerage model that blends technology with strong relationships to maximize client results. Our focus will remain on delivering exceptional service, customized solutions, and innovative investment opportunities.

 What are your growth plans?

 We’re currently looking to hire experienced commercial real estate agents and registered representatives with DST experience. At the same time, we’re continuing to enhance our 1031 exchange platform to better serve our clients and strategic partners.
