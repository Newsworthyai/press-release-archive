# Q&amp;A with Amelia Klobchar, Collections Manager at Monterey Financial Services: 5 Tips for Having Difficult Conversations in Business

As the manager overseeing collections for Monterey Financial Services, a receivables management and finance company working with businesses for the past 35 years, Amee Klobchar has spent 14 years working across positions in the company, as loan servicing supervisor, finance manager, and employee development manager. Currently as collections manager, she oversees processes and strategies for collecting past due payments for goods and services, while maintaining positive customer relationships. We sat down with Amee recently to ask about how the industry has evolved and how she manages difficult conversations about finances and debt.

 How did you get started in the finance industry?

 When I walked through the doors of Monterey Financial in June 2011, I entered the financial services industry completely by chance. I was coming off a major career change with a background in marketing—not finance.

 Introduced to the company through a referral, I was drawn in by the opportunity for growth and a workplace that genuinely invested in its people. What I found was much more than a job—it was the start of a purposeful career.

 Tell me how your career path evolved to assume collections for the organization.

 Since starting with Monterey Financial Services (MFS), I’ve grown into leadership roles where I’ve helped shape training, company culture, and performance strategies within the debt recovery space. Fourteen years later, I stepped into the role of Collections Manager—my third time working in the department I have always had a soft spot for. My career has been marked by versatility, mentorship, and a dedication to Monterey Financial’s mission: lead with performance, prioritize teamwork, and take responsibility while growing together. I’ve had the opportunity to serve in all three of our operations divisions, including Finance and Employee Development. It’s been a journey—equal parts grit and growth.

 How would you characterize Monterey Financial Services?

 MFS provides receivables and consumer financing, lease-to-own programs, loan servicing and delinquent debt recovery to businesses in industries ranging from dental and medical, automotive, sporting goods, vocational schools and training, to home improvement, and more. For 35 years, MFS has helped businesses to maximize the value of their services and products by optimizing receivables and enabling consumers to finance important purchases. Most importantly, it is focused on community, purpose, and connection. Teamwork and acting responsibly are important parts of our core values and culture. Over the years, I have worked with incredible mentors and colleagues at MFS and feel fortunate to be part of a close-knit community there.

 What do you like about working in your field?

 What I love most about the industry I work in is the chance to truly connect with people, engage in honest conversations, and bring a human touch to working through challenging situations—without passing judgment.

 How has the finance and collections industry changed since you started?

 The industry has changed a lot. What used to be rooted in rigid, old-school tactics has shifted toward a more human-centered, solution-based approach. MFS leads with this mindset—focusing on financial health and sustainable recovery. It’s about meeting people where they are, spotting money problems early, and guiding them to a resolution that makes sense.

 As someone who often has to have difficult conversations with people who may owe money or with employees, what have you learned in your career?

 Whether you’re speaking with employees, clients, or consumers—here’s what I’ve learned about having the tough conversations in business:

 1. Lead with Intention

 My leadership style is built on transparency, fairness, and purpose. I hold myself accountable to address issues—good or bad—quickly, and I expect my team to do the same. Leading with intention means setting the tone. Be clear in your expectations and open in your communication. Tough conversations will happen—whether it’s coaching an underperforming team member or making hard calls on business strategy. But when you lead with purpose and view those moments as growth opportunities, you get stronger results and stronger people.

 2. Don’t Wait

 If you’re dreading a conversation, that’s a pretty good sign it needs to happen. Whether you’re mentoring an employee who isn’t meeting expectations or helping a customer who’s behind on payments, avoidance only delays progress. The best way through is straight ahead. It’s okay to show emotion—it proves you care. These hard conversations, if done right, show you’re genuinely invested in the person and the outcome. And that’s how trust is built.

 3. Put Yourself in Their Shoes

 Take a breath. Listen. Don’t assume intent. People don’t always know their impact, and sometimes what feels like resistance is really confusion—or a lack of perspective. Coming from an entry-level background myself, I remember how it felt to be in those early roles. That gives me empathy in how I lead. Understanding where someone is coming from helps you approach the situation with clarity instead of judgment.

 4. Build a 10-Second Rapport

 From the beginning of my training career, I’ve believed that teaching someone how to talk with customers—not just speak—is everything. In collections, especially, those first 10 seconds really matter. You’re talking to people who may be embarrassed, frustrated, or overwhelmed. You need to humanize the moment—your tone, your words, your pace. If you can make a connection in those first few seconds, you earn the space to navigate the conversation productively.

 5. Educate. Offer Options. Be Clear.

 People can’t choose what they don’t understand. A big part of what we do is show people a path they might not have known existed. That’s especially true when it comes to finances. Give clear information. Explain what the options are. Help people understand the consequences and the benefits. Purposeful, solution-based conversations aren’t about pushing—they’re about partnering. And when someone feels like you’re working with them instead of against them, they’re far more likely to follow through.

 Difficult conversations are part of business. They’re also part of leadership. If you want to grow a strong team and maintain real results, you’ve got to be able to communicate honestly—and care deeply. I see the success of my team and the customers we work with as my own. And that mindset? That’s what drives the outcomes we’re proud of.
