When Charlie and Lynn Lott first visited Lantern Hill, the Erickson Senior Living community in New Providence, N.J., it was to tour the community on behalf of Lynn’s sister, a recent widow, whom they hoped would move closer to them.

 “We ended up liking the community so much we decided to move to Lantern Hill ourselves,” says Charlie.

 Once the Lotts decided to move to Lantern Hill, they received valuable help from the Erickson Realty and Moving Services program, exclusively available to Priority List members and designed to make the moving process as easy as possible.

 A smooth move

 Ready to start their next chapter at Lantern Hill, it was time for the Lotts to sell their house. As Priority List members, they decided to utilize one of Lantern Hill’s preferred real estate agents, one of the perks of the Erickson Realty and Moving Services program.

 “We met with Signature Realty, and they gave us great advice on the best price to list our home. It was very successful, and we sold our house quickly,” says Charlie.

 According to Sales Director Kate Tanis, all of Lantern Hill’s preferred real estate agents are fully vetted to ensure that they are familiar with the area, know how to market properties, and have a strong track record selling homes.

 “We provide our Priority List members with two or three real estate agents and let them make their own decision. That way, they are in control of the home selling process,” says Tanis. “If you use one of our preferred real estate agents, we will be your advocate during the process to ensure that your home sells at the timeline and price you desire,” she adds. Those who utilize a preferred real estate agent can also receive a $2,000 credit toward moving expenses.

 A wealth of resources

 The Lotts also took advantage of Lantern Hill’s complimentary home visit with a member of the sales team.

 A home visit with a member of the Lantern Hill sales team also offers the opportunity to space plan for a new home.

 “If we know upfront how you envision using the space and what furniture you want to bring, when a home becomes available, we will know immediately if it is a good match for you,” Tanis says.

 Connections count

 During the visit, the couple also was connected with a move manager recommended by Lantern Hill.

 “[The move manager] coordinated with the moving company and did a lot of the packing and unpacking for us. They also connected us to an estate sale company, which in turn, connected us to a clearing-out company to remove any remaining items after the estate sale,” Charlie says. “Working with the move manager minimized having to research solutions to the steps in the moving process.”

 Timing your move

 Since Lantern Hill is on pace to sell out with no new construction planned, Tanis and her team work closely with prospective residents to coordinate the timing of their move so that they are assured that they get the home they want.

 Recognizing that some residents are using the equity in their home to pay the 80% refundable entrance fee, Lantern Hill allows residents to pay only 10% of the refundable entrance fee and sign an interest-free promissory note to pay the balance upon the sale of their existing home.

 “This lets them bridge that gap between selling their home and moving here. They can move the furniture they want here, get settled, have their home staged, and then list their home for sale.”

 ‘Everyone is so welcoming’

 Since moving to Lantern Hill in March, Charlie and Lynn are reaping the benefits of their new lifestyle, only four miles from their previous home in Watchung, N.J., “We know the area, and remain close to our friends, doctors, and other services,” says Charlie.

 The couple also enjoys meeting their new neighbors.

 “Everyone is so welcoming. We often meet with our new friends for meals,” says Charlie, who stays active playing bocce and yoga, and recently participated in a campus art show. The couple looks forward to trips to local attractions including the popular Greenwood Gardens.

 “After just two days at Lantern Hill, I told Lynne that I was so surprised how smooth the transition has been. We feel very much at home now,” he adds.
