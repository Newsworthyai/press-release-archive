# Q&amp;A with Navin Gurnaney, CEO of Code Ninjas

Navin Gurnaney was appointed CEO of Code Ninjas, a leading franchise in children’s coding education, in August 2023.

 With more than 20 years of experience, Gurnaney has led teams and shaped business strategies at major global brands including Starbucks, PepsiCo, Domino’s International, Office Depot, and C2 Education—holding leadership roles across North America, Europe, and Asia.

 Throughout his career, he has developed a versatile, hands-on leadership style that focuses on operational excellence, performance, and teamwork. He has harnessed this style to engage the franchise network to strengthen the presence of Code Ninjas and make its services more accessible to children nationwide.

 For those who are unfamiliar, can you start by telling us a bit about Code Ninjas?

 Code Ninjas is the world’s largest and fastest-growing kids coding franchise with over 400 locations across the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom. Programs and camps are offered for kids from ages five to 15 to provide hands-on coding experience through Code Ninjas CREATE and Code Ninjas Jr. Kids who participate in Code Ninjas’ core programs build skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and collaboration – empowering the next generation of tech leaders.

 Code Ninjas has experienced notable growth in recent years. What factors do you attribute this success to, and what markets or demographics are you most excited to expand into next?

 Our growth has been driven by a rising demand for technological education that’s both effective and fun. Parents are actively seeking extracurricular programs that build real-world skills, and kids are naturally drawn to the gamified, collaborative approach we offer. Our strongest growth has come from suburban communities, where demand for after-school and summer programs is driven by working parents seeking quality supplemental experiences for their kids. We’re now focused on expanding internationally and into more communities such as Denver, Brooklyn, Long Island, and San Francisco where access to STEM education has opportunity for continued growth.

 With technology evolving at such a rapid pace, how is Code Ninjas preparing today’s youth with the skills they’ll need to thrive in the future workforce?

 At Code Ninjas, we believe kids shouldn’t just be consumers of technology. They should be creators and innovators. As AI continues to reshape the workforce and automation becomes more widespread, we are equipping students with the foundational skills to succeed in a tech-driven world. Through coding, game development, and robotics, kids learn to think critically, solve problems, and work collaboratively. These skills are increasingly important across every industry.

 Our curriculum is continuously updated to reflect the latest trends in programming and artificial intelligence, ensuring our Ninjas stay current and competitive. We also partner with leading tech companies like Microsoft to provide real-world challenges, such as our nationwide Hack-a-Thon, where students apply their knowledge in creative and impactful ways.

 How does the franchise model at Code Ninjas support scalability while still ensuring a high-quality experience for students across all locations?

 Maintaining a high-quality experience is core to our franchise model. Every franchisee receives in-depth training, ongoing support, and access to proven systems designed for scalability. Our custom IMPACT learning management system delivers a consistent, outcome-based curriculum, tracks student progress through “code belts,” and provides real-time analytics. Combined with centralized scheduling, marketing support, and national brand partnerships, these tools enable franchisees to grow efficiently while delivering a top-tier experience at every location.

 Franchisee support can often make or break a system. What specific tools, training, and ongoing support does Code Ninjas offer to help ensure franchisee success?

 From the moment a franchise agreement is signed, Code Ninjas franchisees are supported with a comprehensive onboarding program, personalized coaching, and continuous guidance from a dedicated support team. We equip franchisees with a full suite of tools to help drive operational success, including our proprietary IMPACT learning management system that delivers a consistent, outcome-based curriculum, tracks student progress through “code belts,” and provides real-time performance analytics.

 Our national and local marketing support is equally robust, featuring brand-wide campaigns, customizable playbooks, social media templates, event strategies, and community outreach guides to help franchisees attract and retain students. Additionally, franchisees benefit from ongoing curriculum updates, access to national partnerships, technology integrations, and regular opportunities to provide feedback that informs system-wide improvements. This well-rounded support structure empowers every franchisee to build a thriving business while delivering an exceptional experience to every student.

 Looking ahead, how do you see the kids coding and STEM education space evolving—and what role do you envision Code Ninjas playing in shaping that future?

 The demand for STEM education will continue to grow rapidly, especially as emerging technologies like AI become integrated into daily life and reshape how we work, learn, and solve problems. At Code Ninjas, we see this as both a challenge and an opportunity to prepare kids not just to use these technologies but to understand, create, and innovate alongside them.

 Our focus is on empowering children with critical-thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration skills that will enable them to thrive in a world where AI and other advanced tools are part of everyday workflows. By continuously evolving our curriculum and expanding access, we aim to lead the way in making STEM education engaging, accessible, and outcomes-driven for every child, regardless of their background.

 What makes Code Ninjas an attractive opportunity for prospective franchisees in today’s market?

 Code Ninjas offers a unique combination of purpose and profitability. We sit at the intersection of two booming industries – tech education and youth enrichment – and provide a proven, scalable model that addresses a real need in communities everywhere. Parents are actively seeking high-quality programs that prepare their kids for the future. That demand translates into long-term growth potential for our franchisees.

 We’re not just helping kids learn to code – we’re helping entrepreneurs make an impact in their communities while building something of real value.
