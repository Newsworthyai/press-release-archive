# MountainOne Bank Honored as a 2025 Best Place to Work by Boston Business Journal

MountainOne is proud to share that it has been named one of the Boston Business Journal’s 2025 Best Places to Work in the Medium Business Category (100-249 employees).

 Each year, the Boston Business Journal celebrates Massachusetts companies that lead the way in cultivating and sustaining exceptional workplace cultures and environments. The prestigious award recognizes 100 companies across a broad spectrum of industries, including financial, technology, retail, and health care, with the common denominator being a commitment to fostering a supportive employee environment.

 Businesses were selected and ranked based on the results of employee-engagement surveys distributed by Business Journal partner Quantum Workplace. Participating employees rated their work environment, work-life balance, job satisfaction, advancement opportunities, management, compensation, and benefits.

 The 2025 honorees were celebrated during a June 12th ceremony at The Westin Copley Place. Accepting the award alongside Mountain President and CEO Robert Fraser was company Spokesgoat Mo. A special publication honoring the Top Places to Work winners appeared in the June 13th weekly edition of the Boston Business Journal.

 “This recognition reflects the remarkable culture our employees have helped create,” said Robert Fraser, President and CEO of MountainOne. “Together, we’ve built and continue to maintain a workplace defined by mutual support, open communication, and a shared commitment to our goals.”
