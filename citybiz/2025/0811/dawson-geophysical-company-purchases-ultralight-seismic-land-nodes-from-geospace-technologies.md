# Dawson Geophysical Company Purchases Ultralight Seismic Land Nodes from Geospace Technologies

Geospace Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ: GEOS) and Dawson Geophysical Company (NASDAQ: DWSN) today jointly announced the first major sale of the Geospace Pioneer, ultralight seismic land node, to Dawson a geophysical services provider. Based on current contract terms the estimated value of the agreement is expected to reach approximately $24 million. The delivery of Pioneer will begin in the third quarter of the calendar year 2025.

 “In our industry, Geospace set the standard for wireless data acquisition land nodes. With Pioneer, we have maintained the data quality output our customers require, while reducing the size and weight of our nodes,” said Rich Kelley, President and CEO, Geospace Technologies. “We are pleased that an industry leader such as Dawson recognized that you do not need to sacrifice quality to achieve the operational efficiency gains associated with Pioneer’s lower power consumption, smaller size, and less weight.”

 Tony Clark, Dawson’s President and CEO, commented, “After significant field testing, we decided to make an investment to increase our channel count with Geospace’s Pioneer product based on the high quality of data offered in a lightweight package. We believe this investment will allow Dawson to be a leader in the industry, giving us a competitive advantage for large integrated high-resolution, high channel count surveys currently demanded by the exploration & production efforts of our industry leaders. We anticipate improved efficiencies in our operations with lighter weight equipment. Additionally, we expect improved calendar efficiency by allowing us to be more competitive for small surveys.”

 Weighing less than 0.5kg, Pioneer is a small, lightweight, single-component, autonomous land wireless seismic data acquisition solution delivering precise, high resolution, accurate survey data. The USA designed and manufactured node continuously records for up to 50 days and offers accelerated deployment with an exclusive QuickDeploy feature. The device was engineered with a proprietary 5Hz geophone for better image quality. For more information on the Pioneer, visit www.Geospace.com/pioneer.
