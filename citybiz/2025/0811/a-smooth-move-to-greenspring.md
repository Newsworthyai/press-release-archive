# A Smooth Move to Greenspring

By Kelly Shue

 When Karen Beasley started researching retirement communities in the Washington, D.C., area, Greenspring, an Erickson Senior Living community in Springfield, Va., caught her eye.

 Ready to conduct her due diligence, she attended a tour of the community with some friends. Sales Counselor Arzo Haider, their tour guide that day, immediately put Karen at ease.

 “She was very open and friendly,” recalls Karen, “and Greenspring was the only place where residents would see us and tell us that if we moved here, we would love it.”

 Impressed by the residents’ rave reviews and the abundance of activities on campus, Karen was sold on Greenspring.

 Priority List perks

 When Karen was ready to make the move, she reached out to Haider and joined the community’s Priority List.

 Haider notes that joining Greenspring’s Priority List is a great place to get started. In addition to saving a place in line for your desired residence, you’ll gain access to Lauren Askey, Greenspring’s planning and moving consultant.

 “Lauren works one-on-one with future residents to provide personalized guidance,” says Haider.

 Members also have access to the community’s preferred moving professionals and vendors, all vetted for quality service.

 From space planning and selling to downsizing and packing, Greenspring Priority List members have access to a range of services to streamline their moves–so they can start enjoying their new vibrant lifestyle from day one.

 Valuable home visit

 Priority List members also have the opportunity to schedule a home visit with Askey, which Karen was excited to take advantage of.

 “The home visit is such a wonderful benefit,” says Karen. “Lauren, as well as representatives from the preferred senior move management and moving companies, visited me in my house–even before I reserved a residence at Greenspring.”

 She continues, “One of the best things they did was go through my house, look at my furniture, and help me determine what I could take with me to Greenspring. The movers even took pictures of all my artwork–something that is very important to me. Everyone treated me so well and answered all of my questions.”

 After the home visit, services provided by the senior move management and moving companies were coordinated for Karen, ensuring her move went off without a hitch.

 “They were always so helpful, taking the time to answer my calls whenever I had questions,” says Karen, who worked closely with the moving company to pack several beloved items in her house.

 “There were breakables and pieces of artwork that I wanted their help with, knowing they would treat my glass artwork carefully,” she says. “They did a wonderful job! I also used their help to pack up my kitchen and parts of my dining room.”

 A seamless move

 On move-in day, Karen met the movers at her new home.

 “Because of the plan we had made, they knew exactly where everything should go,” she says. “They even shared helpful advice on little things, such as pointing out outlets as a way of determining the positioning of my lamps.”

 After the movers brought in her furniture and artwork, Karen worked with the senior move management company to unpack her personal belongings.

 “As they were unpacking the boxes in my bedroom, one of the women came out and said, ‘We found a ring!’ It turns out that it was my mother’s engagement ring,” she recalls. “I’d been looking for that ring for almost 20 years, and there it was. To me, it was a lovely sign that my mother also knew I was doing the right thing.”

 Full steam ahead

 Since her move in March, Karen has been living life to the fullest, attending trivia nights and participating a variety of fitness classes.

 Crediting Greenspring’s planning and moving services for her seamless transition, she recommends working with Askey to anyone considering a move to the community.

 “I absolutely recommend working with Lauren. She will do anything to help you, always going above and beyond,” Karen notes. “I’m very grateful for all the help I received, and I’m excited for what’s to come!”

 She continues, “From the beginning, everyone has been so nice, introducing themselves and inviting me to dinner. Now, I can take advantage of all there is to do, make friends, and enjoy a wonderful life here.”
