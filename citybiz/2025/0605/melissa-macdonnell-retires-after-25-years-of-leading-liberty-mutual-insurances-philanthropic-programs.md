# Melissa Macdonnell Retires After 25 Years of Leading Liberty Mutual Insurances Philanthropic Programs

Liberty Mutual Insurance today announced that Melissa MacDonnell, Founder and President of the Liberty Mutual Foundation and Senior Vice President of Community Investments, will retire in October 2025.

 Since founding the Liberty Mutual Foundation in 2003, MacDonnell has played a pivotal role in advancing the company’s mission to enhance security and build resilience for vulnerable people and communities. Under her leadership, Liberty Mutual and its employees have contributed nearly $1 billion to more than 8,700 nonprofit organizations through the Foundation and employee giving initiatives. Liberty Mutual Foundation has also been recognized for its innovative programs and community engagement efforts, including earning a spot on The Civic 50 for five consecutive years – the only property and casualty insurer to achieve this honor.

 “Melissa has had an extraordinary impact on Liberty Mutual and the communities we serve,” said Liberty Mutual Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney. “Her unwavering commitment to those most in need and her ability to create deep, long-standing and meaningful partnerships have significantly shaped our philanthropic strategy and set a high standard for corporate philanthropy in the Boston area and beyond.”

 In addition to leading the Liberty Mutual Foundation, MacDonnell created the company’s employee community engagement initiatives, including Give with Liberty, Serve with Liberty and Liberty Torchbearers. These programs have generated more than $250 million in nonprofit contributions and mobilized more than 1.5 million hours of community service around the world.

 Melissa’s leadership led to the creation of two Boston-based Liberty Houses for young adults who previously experienced homelessness, and Liberty Playgrounds including the city’s first universally accessible playground. Under her leadership, Liberty Mutual Foundation created several special initiatives including ones related to inflation, climate, and collaboration. These initiatives have garnered recognition for excellence in corporate philanthropy.

 Melissa is an active community leader, having served on various nonprofit boards including Dimock Center, Rodman Family Foundation, The Common Room, Horizons for Homeless Children, and on the Executive Forum for Boston College Center for Corporate Citizenship. Melissa spent fifteen years as a Big Sister to a girl living in a group home and later as a mentor and tutor at the South Sudanese Enrichment for Families.

 “I am incredibly proud of what we have accomplished together over the last twenty-five years,” said MacDonnell. “It has been a privilege to work alongside so many dedicated individuals who are deeply committed to helping others. I look forward to seeing the continued positive impact of our work in the community for years to come.”

 Following her departure, Francis Hyatt will assume the role of Chief Community Investments & Sustainability Officer. With over 30 years at Liberty Mutual, Hyatt brings a wealth of experience in sustainability, leadership development and talent management to this new role. He is also active within the community, serving on the boards of Lazarus House Ministries and Boston Healthcare for the Homeless.

 The company will announce a new President of the Liberty Mutual Foundation, who will be responsible for overseeing its strategic initiatives and ensuring the continued mission of fostering resilience and security within vulnerable communities, at a future date.
