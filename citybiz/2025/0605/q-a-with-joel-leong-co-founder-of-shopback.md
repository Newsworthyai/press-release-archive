# Q&amp;A with Joel Leong, Co-Founder of ShopBack

Joel Leong is the Co-Founder of ShopBack Group, where he leads revenue growth and oversees the commercial performance of all markets.

 In 2014, Joel and his fellow co-founders launched ShopBack, with a bold vision to change the way how advertisers market, and users shop. Since then, the platform has evolved into Asia-Pacific’s leading shopping, rewards, and payments platform, serving over 50 million shoppers across 13 markets and driving more than US$4 billion in annual sales for over 20,000 merchant partners, both online and in-store.

 Joel’s passion for startups and ecommerce was first sparked during his time at National University of Singapore and Fudan University. He began his career at the Singapore Economic Development Board, before moving on to help accelerate growth at Asia’s leading online fashion destination ZALORA, where he served as Regional Head of Partnerships.

 Recognized for his sharp thinking, supportive leadership, and relentless customer focus, Joel is a strong believer that every great product begins with the customer. Today, that same mindset continues to shape ShopBack’s mission : to deliver a rewarding and delightful experience with every purchase.

 ShopBack has become a household name across the Asia-Pacific region. What motivated your decision to bring the platform to the U.S. now?

 The U.S. has always been on our radar, but we wanted to wait until we had something truly valuable to offer. The timing now feels right — both for us as a business and for the market.

 ShopBack was founded with a clear purpose: as former advertisers, the co-founders saw firsthand how expensive and inefficient non-performance-based marketing could be. We built ShopBack to solve that problem for advertisers — and at the same time, to create a more rewarding shopping experience for consumers that goes beyond the purely transactional.

 Over the past decade, we’ve expanded steadily — from Singapore into Southeast Asia, then into Asia-Pacific with Australia and South Korea, and more recently, Germany in Europe. Each new market has given us the opportunity to learn, adapt, and strengthen the way we deliver value. The U.S. is the next step in that journey.

 With U.S. consumers facing rising inflation and a general shift toward value-driven shopping, we believe ShopBack offers the right platform at the right time. We’ve seen our model work in markets with similar dynamics, and we believe U.S. shoppers are ready for a platform that offers real, tangible savings in a way that’s easy and even a bit fun.

 On top of that, no matter which market we enter, localization is key. In the U.S., we’ve already secured great partnerships with trusted brands like Walmart, so we’re off to a strong start and excited to build from here.

 How does ShopBack differentiate itself from other cashback and loyalty platforms already in the U.S. market?

 Two key differentiators are real cashback and gamified savings.

 Many platforms offer points or rewards that come with specific restrictions. At ShopBack, we keep it simple — users earn real money that they can withdraw via PayPal. And instead of being passive, our users can actively earn more through “quests,” bonuses, and even mobile games, which are unique to our platform in the U.S.

 We’re also one of the few platforms offering cashback on brands like Amazon, which is a major draw for U.S. consumers.

 In addition, ShopBack was designed as a mobile-first experience, enhancing usability and helping us better reach younger, on-the-go users who prefer to shop and save directly from their phones.

 From a leadership perspective, what has it taken to scale ShopBack from a startup in Singapore to a platform with 60M+ users across 13 markets?

 It’s taken a lot of listening, learning, and local adaptation to scale globally.

 What works in one market doesn’t always translate to another, so we’ve spent time understanding behavior on the ground — how people shop, what drives their decisions, and what platforms they trust. That means building a team that’s agile, humble, and deeply attuned to local nuances across cultures and time zones.

 Scaling isn’t just about growth metrics — it’s about staying grounded in your mission while constantly evolving how you deliver value. For instance, the way we operate in Singapore differs significantly from Australia, and what we’re doing now in the U.S. will likely look different again. That adaptability, grounded in a clear mission and vision, has helped us scale with purpose and consistency across diverse markets.

 

You’ve integrated gamification into the user experience. What inspired that, and what kind of impact have you seen in terms of engagement and retention?

 We drew inspiration from how people already interact with their phones, particularly Gen Z and Millennials. They’re used to streaks, rewards, and progress bars. We realized shopping doesn’t have to be purely transactional, it can be an experience.

 That’s why we built in quests, streaks, bonuses, and seasonal challenges that keep things fresh and rewarding. Users who engage with our gamified features tend to spend more, earn more, and return more often. It’s not just about gimmicks — it’s about giving people small wins while they save.

 ShopBack has strong partnerships with major global brands like Walmart, and Expedia. How do those relationships come together, and what’s your approach to aligning with retail partners in new markets?

 We don’t see ourselves as just a cashback platform — we’re a performance partner. Our goal is to help brands drive measurable sales and reach high-intent shoppers who are ready to make purchases.

 When we enter a new market, we start by showing retailers how we’ve achieved success elsewhere. Our track record — including US$4B in sales across Asia-Pacific — serves as a strong case study. From there, we work closely with each partner to localize campaigns and ensure we’re delivering results. It’s about alignment, transparency, and proving value early.

 What key trends do you see shaping the future of consumer fintech and e-commerce, especially in a high-inflation, value-driven climate?

 Value is the new loyalty. Consumers are no longer brand-loyal in the traditional sense — they’re loyal to platforms that deliver real utility. That means transparency, ease, and tangible savings. Fintech and e-commerce players that help consumers stretch their dollar, without making them jump through hoops, win.

 We also expect to see more personalization through data, and deeper integration of savings directly into the shopping flow, not just at the end of it. The future belongs to platforms that make saving feel seamless, not effortful.

 What lessons have you learned as a founder navigating cross-border growth, and what advice would you offer other entrepreneurs looking to scale globally?

 Don’t assume anything. What works in one market is just your starting point elsewhere. Hire local, listen early, and give your product space to evolve.

 Building trust in a new market takes time, and usually more time than you expect. But if you stay close to your users and move with intention, you’ll get there. Scaling globally isn’t just about replication; it’s about adaptability and staying grounded in your mission.

 What’s your vision for ShopBack in the U.S., and how will your product continue to evolve to meet American consumer behavior?

 Our vision is to be the go-to platform for smarter spending, where people earn cash back on everyday purchases and actually enjoy doing it. We’ll continue evolving the product to feel seamless and rewarding for U.S. shoppers by introducing new features, retailers, and savings experiences that align with what American consumers care about : convenience, value, and control.

 As expectations shift, we’ll continue to innovate around what smarter shopping means, without losing sight of the fundamentals. If we can help people feel empowered every time they shop, we’re doing our job.
