# Miami’s New Urban Core: Inside Carlos Rosso’s $2B Vision for Midtown

Few developers have left as significant an imprint on Miami’s skyline as Carlos Rosso. After nearly two decades helping lead the Related Group’s condo division, Rosso launched Rosso Development in 2020 with a mission to create high-design, community-focused projects that reflect the soul of their surroundings. Over the course of his career, he’s delivered more than 16,000 units—from landmark towers like the Paraiso District and Auberge Beach Residences to international standouts like SLS Cancun.

 Today, Rosso is turning his focus to Midtown Miami, where he’s behind two of the city’s most buzzed-about projects: the nearly sold-out Standard Residences set to open later this year, and the newly unveiled $2 billion master-planned community Midtown Park, with the first residential tower branded by Proper Hospitality. We caught up with the Argentine-born developer to talk about the evolution of the neighborhood, what sets Midtown Park apart in a sea of new construction, and why the future of Miami lies in building true urban communities—not just towers.

 Based on past successes you’ve personally had shaping South Florida’s skyline, what drew you to this property specifically?

 I have always had a deep appreciation for neighborhoods with authentic character and the potential for evolution, and Midtown Miami is exactly that. With the incredible growth of the neighboring areas including the Design District and Wynwood, we saw Midtown as the hole in a doughnut: centrally located, culturally vibrant, and still offering opportunities to create something that genuinely stands apart. This site in particular is the missing piece in Midtown, a prime 5-acre parcel that offers the rare opportunity to develop three full blocks and shape an entire piece of a city. In speaking with our neighbors, people were craving public, walkable spaces that could finally link Midtown to its surroundings. By completing this big open space along Midtown Boulevard, we’re building a neighborhood within a neighborhood—with lush green spaces and connectivity—a convergence point that makes it truly unique.

 For Midtown Park Residences by Proper, we wanted to create spaces that seamlessly blend luxury and lifestyle in a way that feels authentic to Miami. Proper worked hand-in-hand with our design teams to create something that reflects what makes the Proper brand distinctive—sophisticated but warm, design-forward but comfortable, luxurious but not flashy. Our role was to champion that vision and ensure it was fully woven into the residential experience. The result is a tower that carries the Proper name, but more importantly, it lives and breathes the Proper lifestyle.

 With over 90 new residential high-rise developments announced in Miami, what do you think differentiates this property from others besides the introductory pricing and Padel Club?

 Our vision from the start was to create a true mixed-use destination that seamlessly blends public space with residential living. We have always been inspired by the charm of European cities—walkable streets, generous sidewalks, outdoor cafés, and vibrant public areas that stay active day and night. That energy is what makes those cities so magnetic, and we wanted to bring that same spirit here. A lot of developments promise luxury, but we’re focused on lifestyle. Midtown Park is about more than just a collection of buildings—it’s about creating a pulse, a heartbeat that connects the entire area. We are creating a five-acre master-planned community where the spaces between buildings are as important as the buildings themselves. The addition of a public padel club, 120,000 square feet of retail, 60,000 square feet of office space, and 950 residences above it all ensures the neighborhood remains active and engaging 24/7—bringing people together at every hour of the day. At the heart of it all is Midtown Park Residences by Proper—the first of four residential towers that will define this dynamic new neighborhood. Our partnership with Proper Hospitality brings a level of sophisticated service and design sensibility that’s unmatched. The extraordinary amenities, thoughtfully designed public spaces, and seamless connection to Miami’s most vibrant neighborhoods create an experience that can’t be replicated elsewhere.

 What inspiration are you using for the Padel Club and the 30,000 sq. ft. gym?

 Our goal is to activate these spaces to feel less like just a place to work out, and more like a social club for Midtown—a sort of urban country club. We are tapping into the incredible energy of Miami’s own fitness scene and are in advanced conversations with some of the city’s most respected, homegrown operators—brands that have a real following and know how to create community.

 Beyond the fitness and wellness component for the Midtown Park by Proper Residences, are there specific amenities or design elements that your buyers consistently request?

 Buyers are asking for multifunctional spaces that enhance daily living—places where they can work from home, host guests, or find moments of calm. To answer that demand, we’re offering over 40,000 square feet of unparalleled owner amenities, from the tropical pool deck with panoramic views and a signature restaurant to sophisticated social spaces like our private lounges, event areas, and co-working spaces. Beyond the physical amenities, what we’re seeing buyers truly value is the Proper approach to service and programming—a curated cultural lens that provides access to Miami’s vibrant scene and creates a genuine sense of lifestyle and community. The Proper team brought that same ethos to The Shelborne by Proper in Miami Beach, which just reopened following a top-to-bottom $100M restoration—reviving one of Miami’s most iconic Art Deco landmarks and quickly reestablishing it as a cultural and hospitality hotspot in South Beach.

 Who do you anticipate will be the primary demographic of buyers?

 We are seeing strong interest from young professionals, entrepreneurs, and creatives — people who value lifestyle, design, and walkability. We are also getting inquiries from bi-coastal buyers and international clients from Latin America and Europe who are looking for a primary or second home, because Miami continues to be a truly international destination.

 What happenings or developments nearby do you most attribute to the evolution of this neighborhood over the past five years?

 The evolution of the Midtown neighborhood has been remarkable. We have seen the Design District transform into a global luxury destination and Wynwood mature from an arts district into a complete neighborhood. What’s most exciting is how Midtown has emerged as the vital connector between these distinct areas, creating a continuous urban experience. This neighborhood now offers everything the modern Miami resident desires—luxury, lifestyle, walkability, safety, and vibrant energy. The area has reached a perfect inflection point where thoughtful development can now bring these distinct neighborhoods together, creating one of Miami’s most integrated and inspiring urban experiences.

 Are you planning any future developments in other emerging Miami neighborhoods and if not, where do you expect the next wave of development to center?

 We are always exploring. Miami is experiencing an incredible moment right now, it’s truly the epicenter of where everything’s happening. I believe the next wave of development will focus on creating complete communities rather than isolated towers, places where people can truly live, work, and play within walking distance. Miami’s future isn’t about building faster or taller; it’s about building smarter, more sustainably, and with a greater focus on community.
