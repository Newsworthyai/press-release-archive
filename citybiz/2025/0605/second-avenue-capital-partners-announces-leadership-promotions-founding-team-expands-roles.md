# Second Avenue Capital Partners Announces Leadership Promotions; Founding Team Expands Roles

Second Avenue Capital Partners, the specialty finance affiliate of SB360 Holdings, today announced a leadership transition as Chris O’Connor, President of SACP, retired effective May 31, 2025. Chris’s leadership was key to the firm’s success and in establishing its strong relationships across the client and lending community.

 As part of this transition, SACP has promoted the following individuals, including three of its founding members, to new leadership roles:

 * Michael Sullivan, Founding Member – Head of Originations and Corporate Growth
* Mark Gallivan, Founding Member – Head of Investments and Operations
* Andrew Prunier, Founding Member – Head of Portfolio Team and Strategy
* Michael Russell, Head of Deal Execution

 While these new roles strengthen SACP’s operational leadership, Aaron Miller, President and Managing Partner of SB360 Holdings, will continue to lead all SB360 verticals, providing active oversight and strategic direction across the entire organization. He will also continue to identify synergistic opportunities across the broader Schottenstein platform.

 These leaders have been instrumental since the firm’s inception — developed in partnership with the Miller and Schottenstein families — and have helped shape SACP into a leading provider of flexible capital solutions across the retail and consumer sectors.

 The transition is supported by SACP’s experienced and dedicated team. Many team members have been with the firm since its founding and bring deep expertise in lending, underwriting, capital allocation, and relationship management — capabilities that remain central to the firm’s performance and reputation.

 

“The platform we built at SACP was always rooted in partnership and precision,” said Aaron Miller, President and Managing Partner of SB360 Holdings. “Andrew, Michael, and Mark have been with us since day one, and their contributions to our success are immeasurable. Mike Russell, who has been with us for several years, is also a vital part of SACP, and he will continue to enhance our business in the future. I’ll continue working directly with them to drive growth and ensure we remain focused on serving our borrowers with speed, flexibility, and insight.”

 “The team now stepping into expanded roles has been core to that vision from the beginning, and I’m confident they’ll continue to lead with integrity, creativity, and discipline.”

 The broader SACP and SB360 team remains a cornerstone of the organization’s strength. With expertise spanning underwriting, credit, collateral monitoring, and operations, the team brings a collaborative, borrower-first approach that continues to differentiate the firm.

 “We’re proud of what we’ve all built together,” said Joseph Schottenstein. “With Aaron’s continued leadership and the strength of our lending team, we’re well-positioned to expand our reach while staying true to the principles that have guided us from the beginning.”

 Sharing his thoughts on his retirement and the transition, Chris O’Connor said, “Leading SACP has been one of the most rewarding chapters of my career. I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished and have complete confidence in Andrew, Michael, Mark, and Mike as they take on expanded roles. The firm’s future is in excellent hands.”
