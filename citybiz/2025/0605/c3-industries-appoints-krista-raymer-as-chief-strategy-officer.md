# C3 Industries Appoints Krista Raymer as Chief Strategy Officer

ANN ARBOR, Mich., June 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — C3 Industries, a leading multi-state cannabis company dedicated to premium cannabis experiences for customers, announced today the appointment of Krista Raymer as Chief Strategy Officer and the strategic acquisition of Vetrina, a leading cannabis retail consulting firm. These moves represent C3’s commitment to driving profitability through data-driven insights and position the Company for enhanced operational excellence across its multi-state High Profile retail network.

 Krista Raymer, Chief Strategy Officer – Accomplished strategic leader and founder of Vetrina. Raymer’s extensive experience includes consulting for 270+ cannabis retailers across the US helping them to navigate the complexities of cannabis retail. As a recognized industry leader specializing in data-driven business transformation, market expansion, and profitable growth, she and her team have pioneered innovative approaches to customer acquisition, spend optimization, and purchase frequency within the cannabis retail sector for the last 6 years.

 “Following our recent retail leadership expansion, bringing Vetrina in-house alongside Krista’s appointment as Chief Strategy Officer represents another pivotal step in building our executive infrastructure,” said Ankur Rungta, CEO and cofounder of C3 Industries. “This strategic move gives us exclusive access to proven retail consulting expertise that has helped hundreds of cannabis retailers achieve profitability. Combined with our newly expanded retail team, we now have the comprehensive capabilities needed to optimize every aspect of our C3 operations.”

 The expanded leadership team will help oversee C3’s growing retail network, which currently includes locations across Michigan, Missouri, Massachusetts, Illinois, New Jersey, Connecticut and soon to be Kentucky with multiple High Profile dispensaries scheduled to open throughout 2025.

 “This strategic investment in retail leadership reflects our commitment to elevating the High Profile experience while preparing for our next growth phase,” said Valay Shah, CFO of C3 Industries. “While we have historically grown the business primarily through organic expansion, C3 has achieved sufficient scale where M&A activity will drive more meaningful growth in the years ahead. We expect significant industry consolidation, and this investment not only strengthens our current operations but positions C3 as an attractive partner for M&A opportunities over the next 18 months, as we enter an anticipated period of heightened deal activity.”

 With this expanded leadership team and proven retail expertise now in place, the Company is well positioned to drive measurable improvements in retail performance while supporting the company’s broader strategic objectives across all markets.
