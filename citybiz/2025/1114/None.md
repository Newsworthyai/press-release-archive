# Longtime Westfield Residents are Neighbors Again at Lantern Hill

By Gregory J. Alexander

 When Ed and Evelyn Pretre decided to sell their house in Westfield, N.J., and move to a retirement community, they had a checklist of criteria for their new home.

 One factor was especially crucial for Ed. “I have a Corvette I bought in 2001. It looks brand-new to this day! So, when we looked at different retirement communities in the area, I wanted one with underground parking,” he says.

 At Lantern Hill, an Erickson Senior Living community in New Providence, N.J., Ed and Evelyn could check underground parking–and a whole lot more–off their list.

 A great location Ed and Evelyn, Westfield residents for 45 years, were mainly drawn to Lantern Hill for its convenient location. “We did not want to leave this area, as we have formed a lot of connections,” explains Ed. The couple was also glad to hear that moving to Lantern Hill would put them closer to their daughter, who lives less than 10 miles away in Cranford, N.J.

 “It was important for us to live close to her so that we could see her often,” Ed says. Kate Tanis, sales director at Lantern Hill, notes that more and more people are moving from Westfield and nearby Morristown, N.J., as the community offers the best of both worlds.

 “Retirees who move from nearby towns find that they can stay connected to their longtime friends, doctors, churches, and favorite stores,” explains Tanis. “Plus, they make new friends and enjoy a variety of activities here at Lantern Hill.”

 Making new friends People who move from the area often find that they have a lot in common with their new neighbors. Tanis and her team try to keep an ear out for connections and organize introductions when they can. “For example, we will introduce a new resident from Westfield to a longtime resident who also lived there so they can share stories and perhaps carpool back to Westfield to attend an event or church service,” Tanis explains.

 In fact, shortly after Ed and Evelyn moved to Lantern Hill, they were introduced to another couple from Westfield, with whom they shared an interesting connection.

 “It turns out that we carpooled with them when our kids were little and took swimming lessons together,” Ed shares. “Many people appreciate moving to Lantern Hill because of the strong ties and its sense of community,” says Tanis. “It’s also easier for new residents to meet new people, now that they’re not isolated in their old neighborhood.”

 Ed agrees, saying, “When we moved to Westfield, we had two small kids, and there were several families with small children on our block. Over the years, the kids moved away, and then the parents slowly moved, too. We ended up only having our next-door neighbors as friends in the neighborhood before we moved to Lantern Hill.”   Staying active Since moving to Lantern Hill a little over a year ago, Ed and Evelyn have participated in an array of activities, finding plenty of opportunities to meet neighbors and make new friends.

 “We both play bocce, and I play [table tennis] and pinochle often,” says Ed. “Evelyn plays Rummikub several times a week. Plus, when they have bingo, I get to call the games, which is really fun.” They also enjoy exercising at the on-campus fitness center and attending happy hour get-togethers.

 Warm and welcoming “No matter your age, there is something for everyone here!” he says. “Everyone here is so friendly and nice. When we are walking down the hall, everyone says hello. We’ve already made lots of new friends.” The couple also credits Lantern Hill’s staff members with making them feel right at home.

 “The staff here is always looking out for us, especially [Planning and Moving Consultant] Anthony Giliberti,” says Ed. “He helps me when I have issues with my computer and so much more. He goes out of his way to help us. He’s become like a son to us.”
