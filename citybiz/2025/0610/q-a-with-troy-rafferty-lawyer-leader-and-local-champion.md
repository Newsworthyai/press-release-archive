# Q&amp;A with Troy Rafferty: Lawyer, Leader, and Local Champion

Troy Rafferty, a shareholder at Rafferty Domnick Cunningham & Yaffa, is recognized as one of the nation’s most accomplished trial lawyers, with nearly 30 years of success representing clients harmed by defective drugs and products. His track record includes landmark jury verdicts of $150 million and $140 million in the Testosterone Replacement Therapy litigation—among the largest in the country—and a leadership role in securing a historic $36 billion opioids settlement. Most recently, in March 2025, he was appointed to the Plaintiffs’ Leadership Council of the Depo-Provera litigation, serving on the Plaintiffs’ Executive Committee to help guide national pretrial proceedings.

 Board-certified in civil trial law and consistently ranked among the top trial lawyers in America, Mr. Rafferty has earned honors including the Perry Nichols Award, Florida’s highest civil justice award, and induction into the International Academy of Trial Lawyers. His philanthropic work mirrors his professional dedication: from securing $20 million in compensation for abuse survivors of the Dozier and Okeechobee Schools for Boys to supporting youth development programs in Pensacola. A respected lecturer and fierce advocate for justice, Mr. Rafferty continues to influence both the courtroom and the broader legal community nationwide.

 Troy, congratulations on the launch of The Rafferty Center. What does this project mean to you personally?

 Thank you—it means everything. Ashley and I have always believed that when you’re fortunate enough to be in a position to give back, you don’t wait—you lead. The Rafferty Center is about more than basketball courts and classrooms. It’s about creating a space where kids feel safe, supported, and inspired. For us, this is a chance to give back to Pensacola and give hope to the children.

 You’ve had an extraordinary legal career. How does your work in the courtroom connect to your work in the community?

 At their core, both are about standing up for people who need a voice. In the courtroom, I fight for justice—often for clients going through the worst,most horrific chapter of their lives. In the community, I fight for opportunity—especially for kids who just need someone to believe in them. The law and the community work go hand in hand. They’re both about showing up, doing the hard work, and not backing down.

 The SYSA has been serving Pensacola youth for decades. Why was this the right time to build this center?

 Because the need is growing, and because the opportunity was right in front of us. SYSA has been doing remarkable work for years—on shoestring budgets, limited resources, and a whole lot of love. When we saw a chance to amplify that impact, we jumped. We’re not just building a building. We’re building capacity, momentum, futures, and hope.

 You’ve been a major force in both the legal world and philanthropic circles. What drives you?

 Two Things I hate most – bullies and injustice. I hate it. Always have. Whether it’s a catastrophic injury case where a family’s life has been upended, or a community where too many kids are being left behind, I can’t just stand on the sidelines. I’ve been blessed with mentors, education, and opportunities—and I feel a deep responsibility to extend that to others.

 Let’s talk about your law firm, Rafferty Domnick Cunningham & Yaffa. What sets your team apart?

 We care. I know every firm says that, but we live it. Every case is personal. We’re in the trenches with our clients, and we never forget what’s at stake. We combine elite-level legal skill with human compassion. That’s what wins cases—and more importantly, that’s what builds trust.

 What do you think the legal industry could learn from the way SYSA and The Rafferty Center are building community?

 The legal industry could use more humility and more heart. It’s not just about being the smartest person in the room. It’s about listening, lifting people up, and showing up consistently. SYSA’s work is built on relationships, hard work, and real commitment—and that’s a lesson every lawyer should take to heart.

 What are you most proud of at this stage in your career?

 Honestly? That my team, clients, and community knows I’ve got their back. That clients trust me with the most important fights of their lives. And that my daughter knows our family’s name stands for something bigger than just winning.

 What’s next for The Rafferty Center?

 Construction starts in a few weeks, and we’ll be sprinting toward the finish line. But long-term, this is just the beginning. We want this to be a place where kids dream big—and where those dreams are matched with resources, mentors, and support. We’re already thinking about future programming, scholarship opportunities, and how to bring even more partners to the table.

 And what’s next for you?

 MORE! More advocacy, more community building, and more showing up. Whether it’s in a courtroom or at a community meeting, I’ll keep doing everything I can to make a difference. That’s the mission.
