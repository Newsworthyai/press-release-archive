# Q&amp;A with Francisco Martin-Rayo, Co-Founder and CEO of Helios

Francisco Martin-Rayo is the CEO of Helios AI, the world’s preeminent climate risk platform that predicts agricultural disruptions and commodity prices. He is an expert in climate risk and artificial intelligence, and has been published in the Financial Times, Nikkei Asia, and Inc.com, among others. Prior to founding Helios AI, he was Chief Commercial Officer at Deep Labs AI, and a Principal at the Boston Consulting Group, where he focused on digital transformations for Fortune 100 companies. He holds an MPP from Harvard University, a B.Sc. (Wharton) and a B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania.

 Can you tell us a little about your background and how you got the idea for Helios?

 I’ve launched a few startups, spent years at BCG helping traditional industries go digital, and even ran an avocado importing business. My co-founder, Eden Canlilar, is a former senior AI engineer at Google, an Abie Award winner, and also owned a restaurant—so between us, we’ve lived at the intersection of food and tech for years. Helios was born from two big beliefs: that climate disruptions are going to keep shaking up the food supply chain, and that AI has finally advanced enough to help companies see those shocks coming before they hit.

 Why is supply chain forecasting so hard for businesses today, and how does Helios help?

 Supply chains are no longer predictable—climate volatility, geopolitical tensions, and shifting consumer demand make traditional models obsolete. Helios uses AI trained on billions of data points to flag disruptions months in advance, helping companies act before prices spike or goods run out.

 What’s an example of catching a potential commodity crunch ahead of time?

 One of our proudest moments was helping Libby’s—our platform forecast a sharp rise in global mandarin prices months ahead of time. They acted early and ended up saving 15% on their global procurement costs. That’s exactly why we started the company and how we help customers!

 How is the climate crisis complicating supply chain operations for companies?

 The climate crisis makes the ground beneath supply chains literally shift—droughts, floods, and heatwaves can wipe out harvests or shut down transport routes with little warning. It’s no longer about efficiency; it’s about resilience.

 What was the 2025 Spring growing season like, and how will that impact the rest of the year?

 Spring 2025 was all over the place—record heat in Texas led to early planting, but that was followed by drought, while cold snaps and floods delayed planting in the Midwest. Some crops like wheat started flowering too early, while others like soybeans couldn’t even get in the ground on time. The rest of the year will be defined by this shaky start: shorter growing windows, higher pest pressure, and tighter supply in key regions are all in play.

 What’s the impact of supply chain issues on consumers?

 Consumers feel it at the checkout aisle—whether it’s $8 for a carton of eggs or empty shelves during peak season. Behind every price spike is a disruption we’re trying to get ahead of.

 What’s it like to launch and grow an AI company when there’s so much noise and activity in the market?

 It can be a double-edged sword—AI is hotter than ever, but that also means cutting through hype with real results. We’re hyper focused on bringing cutting edge AI to our customers in a way that positively impacts their businesses (and bottom lines), not just innovation for its own sake.

 What will AI’s positive impact on the climate crisis be?

 AI can’t stop climate change, but it can help us adapt smarter and faster. Whether it’s optimizing irrigation, rerouting logistics, or forecasting crop failures, AI gives us time—and time is everything in a crisis.

 You’ve had a very diverse career, spanning finance, consulting, foreign affairs, and now AI. What motivates you to tackle all these different challenges and opportunities?

 I’ve always chased hard problems that matter—ones where the stakes are high and the solutions aren’t obvious. Building Helios is a way to combine my curiosity, my background, and my belief that tech should actually solve real-world problems.

 Why did you decide to base the company in the Washington D.C. area?

 We’re at the intersection of policy, global trade, and climate strategy—it’s where some of the most important decisions are being made. Plus, we love being close to both farmland and federal agencies—it’s the perfect home for a climate-tech company like ours.
