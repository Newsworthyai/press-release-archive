# Q&A with Thais Lopez Vogel, Co-Founder of VoLo Foundation, Shares the Story Behind CBS’s New Eco-Adventure Series The Visioneers

VoLo Foundation Co-Founder Thais Lopez Vogel Shares the Story Behind CBS’s New Eco-Adventure Series.

 After the launch of The Visioneers with Zay Harding this April on CBS, VoLo Foundation takes a bold step forward in its mission to advance climate education. Produced by Hearst Media Production Group, with VoLo as exclusive partner, the series blends science, emotion, and innovation to make climate action accessible — and exciting — for all ages.

 Hosted by the charismatic and award-winning Zay Harding, The Visioneers transforms complex data into captivating, family-friendly stories designed to spark curiosity and inspire real-world change.

 We spoke with Thais Lopez Vogel, co-founder and trustee of VoLo Foundation, about the vision behind this project, the power of heartfelt storytelling, and how The Visioneers aims to bring climate conversations into everyday households.

 What does the launch of The Visioneers mean for VoLo Foundation?

 It’s a dream come true. For years, we’ve worked to bring science closer to people in meaningful ways. This show extends that effort, offering a platform where complex information becomes stories meant to inspire, move, and ultimately mobilize. It’s both an educational and emotional mission.

 How did the partnership with Hearst Media Production Group and Zay Harding come about?

 We share a vision with Hearst: bringing environmental topics to broader audiences in a rigorous and entertaining way. Our relationship with Zay was a natural fit. He’s been part of the VoLo family for years. His energy, curiosity, and gift for storytelling make him the perfect host. He connects with children, adults, scientists, and dreamers alike.

 We’ve supported the series every step of the way, from validating the science to aligning the message with our mission. We’ve contributed resources, technical knowledge, and a strong network of experts and organizations. Each story featured in The Visioneers reflects real solutions and real people.

 What makes The Visioneers different from other environmental shows?

 Its ability to inspire without alarming, and to educate without overwhelming. The Visioneers doesn’t dwell on the problems — it shows us the people solving them. You’ll meet scientists, engineers, activists, and everyday families doing extraordinary things. Zay translates science into approachable, human stories that become a bridge from knowledge to action.

 What do you hope families take away from the show?

 We hope they feel inspired to start talking about climate at home — with curiosity, not fear. When kids start asking questions, parents find answers, and everyone sees being part of the solution is possible.

 

 What would you say to someone who hasn’t seen the show yet?

 You don’t need to be a scientist or an activist to enjoy it. The Visioneers is made for everyone. Its stories remind us that change starts with a spark of opportunity. If you’ve ever asked yourself, “What can I do?” this show offers real examples of people taking action.

 Where can viewers watch The Visioneers?

 The series airs on CBS as part of the network’s educational/informational block, CBS WKND, and is also available for streaming on CBS.com and Pluto TV. We invite everyone to tune in and celebrate the power of science and storytelling to help shape a more conscious and sustainable future.
