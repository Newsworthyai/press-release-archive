# Button Finance Closes $5 Million Series A Amid Surge in Home Equity Value

New York-based Button Finance, which helps homeowners leverage their home equity for loans, closed a $5 million Series A funding round led by Stamford, Conn.-based Hildene Capital Management and other existing investors. Founded in 2019, Button Finance uses an AI-powered underwriting platform to ensure funding within five days.

 “While many startups chase growth at all costs, we’ve built a fundamentally sound business that’s been cash flow positive and profitable for quite some time,” said CEO Jason Harris, a former Jefferies executive. “This strategic $5M raise allows us to accelerate growth while preserving equity for our shareholders. We have scaled to over 60 employees in the past two years, nearly tripling our monthly volume in just six months, and we are just getting started.”

Since starting his career as an M&A banker at Jefferies, he has worked at Amherst Pierpont, Flatiron Investors, and PeerIQ. Harris has an MBA from New York University’s Stern School of Business.

 “Button Finance is democratizing access to home equity at precisely the right moment,” said Brett Jefferson, president and co-chief investment officer of Hildene Capital Management. “Their technology isn’t just innovative; it’s solving real financial challenges for everyday Americans. We are not just investing in Button Finance; we are committing to powering their next billion dollars in home equity originations.”

 Citing data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Button Finance said U.S. homeowners controlled $35 trillion in home equity as of early 2025. This reservoir of wealth has led to a surge in demand for home equity solutions, as consumers strategically tap their properties for renovations, debt consolidation, and liquidity in today’s elevated interest environment, Button Finance said.

 “American homeowners now have more untapped equity than ever before, given the recent home-price rally,” said Harris. “Button Finance’s products empower borrowers to access their home equity, pay down high-interest debt, and make value-enhancing renovations to their homes.”
