NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE: RL) today announced that, as part of its Board of Directors evolution strategy, it has approved the appointment of Angela Ahrendts as new Lead Independent Director following the Company’s 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

We are grateful for his unwavering support and thoughtful leadership as well as the care he has shown for our Company and our teams,” said Ralph Lauren, Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer.

 “Angela has consistently offered valuable guidance and brought her perspective as a respected innovator in the industry. We look forward to continuing to benefit from her leadership and contributions as our new Lead Independent Director,” Ralph Lauren added.

 “We are proud to have a Board comprised of deep, unique and differentiated experiences, all of which continue to contribute to our strength and durability as a business. I am grateful for Hubert’s guidance over the years, particularly in helping drive our Company’s performance and transformation and I look forward to working closely with Angela in her expanded role,” said Patrice Louvet, President & Chief Executive Officer.
