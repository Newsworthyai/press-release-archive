# Amrize Debuts as Independent, Publicly Traded Company

NEW YORK & ZURICH–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Amrize announces its debut today as an independent, publicly traded company with the completion of its 100% spin-off from Holcim. Amrize shares will begin trading today on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the SIX Swiss Exchange under the ticker symbol “AMRZ.”

 Amrize is building North America, as the partner of choice for professional builders with advanced branded solutions from foundation to rooftop. With over 1,000 sites and a highly efficient distribution network, Amrize delivers for its customers in every U.S. state and Canadian province. Its 19,000 teammates uniquely serve every construction market from infrastructure, commercial and residential to new build, repair and refurbishment.

 Jan Jenisch, Amrize Chairman and CEO: “This is an exciting day for all our teammates across North America as we begin our journey together as Amrize. As an independent, publicly traded company, Amrize will capitalize on North America’s attractive construction market driven by long term mega-trends from infrastructure modernization and onshoring of manufacturing to data center expansion and the opportunity to bridge the housing gap. With our track record of profitable growth, market-leading operations and broad range of advanced building solutions, we are ideally positioned to be the partner of choice for the professional builders of North America and to unlock value for all stakeholders.

 “It has been a privilege to be part of Holcim since 2017 and I thank the entire Holcim team for their outstanding performance and contributions over the years, including the exceptional execution of our spin-off creating two distinct, independent champions. I wish the Holcim team every success as they begin their next chapter.”

 

The spin-off is completed via the distribution of a dividend-in-kind of one Amrize share for every Holcim share owned as of the close of business on June 20, 2025.

 In 2024, Amrize generated $11.7 billion in revenue, a 13% CAGR from 2021; and achieved $3.2 billion in Adjusted EBITDA1, a 16% CAGR since 2021, with an overall 27% Adjusted EBITDA Margin2. The company generated $1.7 billion in Free Cash Flow3 in 2024, a 15% CAGR since 2021, and has consistently delivered Adjusted EBITDA Cash Conversion Ratio4 of more than 50% each year. The company has completed 36 acquisitions since 2018.

 Amrize presented its business strategy and mid-term financial targets at its investor day in New York on March 25. Now an independent, publicly traded company, Amrize will continue to deliver superior performance and value creation with above market growth, margin expansion and leading cash generation. It will pursue a growth-focused strategy with capital allocation prioritizing investments in the business, value accretive M&A and superior shareholder returns.

 Company leaders will mark the milestone by ringing the NYSE opening bell today at 9:30 am ET. Amrize leaders will then visit sites across the U.S. and Canada to celebrate and thank teammates.
