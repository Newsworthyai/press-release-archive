# Ten Educators Honored with Freedom Federal Credit Union’s 2025 Golden Apple Awards

Educators from across Harford and Baltimore County/City Were Recognized on August 13

 Freedom Federal Credit Union honored ten local educators at its 14th annual Golden Apple Awards reception, held at Mountain Branch Grill & Pub in Joppa, Maryland on Wednesday, August 13. Established in 2011, the Golden Apple Awards provide grants to help educators bring innovative classroom and schoolwide initiatives to life and enhance student learning.

 This year marked the first time the program expanded beyond Harford and Baltimore Counties to include educators from Baltimore City. Freedom also increased the number of grants awarded, presenting ten awards totaling $10,000: two at $2,000, four at $1,000, and four at $500.

 The top $2,000 awards went to educators using podcasting technology to give students new ways to learn and lead. Tara Recor of Prospect Mill and Emmorton Elementary Schools in Harford County will implement podcast-powered “learning walks,” blending physical activity with academic enrichment. Taylor Herring of Chesapeake Terrace Elementary in Baltimore County is launching a student-led podcast that will build confidence, communication skills, and leadership opportunities across her school community.

 At the $1,000 level, educators are focusing on STEM innovation and sustainability. Jim Renaud of Western Tech High School in Baltimore County will expand engineering opportunities to spark creativity and confidence in his students. Mike Homishak of Aberdeen High School in Harford County gained support for his two newly launched electives in Bacteriology and Zoology, allowing students to experience college-level science in high school. At Edgewood Elementary, Lisa Brown will create both a mobile Makerspace cart and a permanent Media Center station, bringing hands-on STEM to every student in her school. And in Baltimore City, Julia Bailey of Darchei Noam Montessori is co-leading a schoolwide environmental sustainability program that brings science and horticulture to life.

 Finally, the $500 awardees are tackling innovative ways to support the whole child and connect learning beyond the classroom. In Baltimore City, Rhea Butler of Success Academy West will establish a calming Wholeness Room to give students and staff a safe space to recharge emotionally. Melissa Berardelli of C. Milton Wright High School in Harford County is bridging algebra with the real world, using motion analysis and data science to show the power of math in everyday life. At Hall’s Cross Roads Elementary in Harford County, Lindsey Gilmour is creating take-home learning kits to empower IEP students and strengthen school-to-home partnerships. And at Patterson Mill High School, Michelle Curry is building a more tactile and engaging pre-school space where her students can gain hands-on experience in early childhood education.

 “Each of these educators has taken a bold idea and transformed it into an opportunity to inspire, empower, and support their students,” said Mike MacPherson, President and CEO of Freedom Federal Credit Union. “For fourteen years, the Golden Apple Awards have been a way to give back to the people who dedicate their lives to shaping our communities’ future, and we are proud to continue growing this program.”

 The program opened with remarks from Councilman David Marks of Baltimore County, a strong advocate for the awards since their expansion into his community. “As an educator and as a Councilman, I know that partnerships are key to achieving academic success. Just as teachers need to build partnerships with parents to help students, schools need partnerships with the private sector to often get things done,” Marks shared. “Freedom Federal Credit Union deserves a Gold Star for its outstanding support of our teachers and schools.”

 Closing remarks were delivered by Dr. Eric Davis, Deputy Superintendent for Operations at Harford County Public Schools, who spoke about the essential partnership between HCPS and Freedom Federal Credit Union. “Freedom Federal Credit Union continues to be an extraordinary partner to Harford County Public Schools,” said Dr. Davis. “They go above and beyond for our staff and students, consistently stepping up whenever there is a need. The Golden Apple Awards are just one example of how Freedom helps spark innovation and encourages educators to dream bigger for their students. We are deeply grateful for Freedom’s ongoing investment in the people who make the greatest difference in our schools.”

 Freedom also recognized key partners, including Clever Cat Marketing for the event’s centerpieces, and Comcast and The Maryland Ad Network for helping to promote the program to schools and educators across the region.

 In addition to the guest speakers, Freedom was honored to bring together many special guests including the awardees, their families, school administrators, and HCPS Teacher of the Year, Shelby Hultquist, and several members of local government and the HCPS Board of Education.

 The annual awards are intended to support Freedom Federal Credit Union members who are employed at a Harford County, Baltimore County, Baltimore City, or Carroll County school and have a creative vision for education that can only be met with community support. All applicants were asked to submit an essay demonstrating how their idea would serve their students, class, school, or their local community.
