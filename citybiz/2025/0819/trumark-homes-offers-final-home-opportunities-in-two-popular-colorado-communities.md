 Trumark Homes, the award-winning Western U.S. homebuilder, announces the last opportunity to purchase homes in some of the first Colorado neighborhoods it developed when entering the state in 2021. The neighborhoods of Sugar Hills, Fairways, and Acadia at RainDance and Pelican Shores in Water Valley are highlighting the final few homes available. Notably, the builder has reserved a selection of its premier homesites for the final phases at Festival at RainDance, with a limited number of move-in ready homes currently available and planned lot releases in the coming months.

 “As we near sellout in some of our neighborhoods, we are proud of the homes we offer and appreciate the opportunity to help people find their forever homes in this growing Windsor community,” said Brian Mulqueen, Colorado Division President for Trumark Homes. “The common denominator for homebuyers in RainDance and Pelican Shores is a love for Colorado’s active lifestyle and a discerning eye for high quality homes. By combining the best of both worlds, we have experienced great success with these communities. We look forward to offering homebuyers a chance to call it home with continued expansion of our Festival at RainDance neighborhood and some of the best lots still to be released.”

 RainDance is an amenity-rich master-planned community ideal for those who enjoy the outdoors, with access to a championship style golf course, water park, stocked pond, a community orchard and farm offering fresh fruits and vegetables, and approximately 15 miles of community trails and access to the 21-mile Poudre River Trail.

 Festival includes single-family detached homes with six floorplans ranging from 2,046 to 2,875 square feet, with three to six bedrooms and two to four bathrooms. Some homes will offer finished basements which will further expand the functionality. Elevations include one- and two-story options. Prices start in the mid $600,000s.*

 Acadia features the final two single-family detached residences on expansive one-acre lots located next to the RainDance National Golf Course. The ranch floorplans offer 4,710 square feet, with four bedrooms, and four-and-a-half bathrooms. Homes are priced from the high $1 millions.*

 Sugar Hills includes single-family detached homes with two ranch floorplans offering 2,461 square feet, four bedrooms and three-and-a-half baths, as well as, one, fully furnished, model home offering 4,126 square feet with five bedrooms and five bathrooms. Prices range from the mid $800,000s to over $1.1 million.*

 Fairways features single-family detached homes with walk-out access to RainDance National Golf Club. The homesites offer two ranch floorplans ranging from 3,001 to 3,110 square feet, with three to five bedrooms and three-and-a-half to four bathrooms, plus three-car garages and a golf cart garage. Prices start in the mid $1 millions.*

 Pelican Shores, part of the acclaimed Water Valley master-planned community in Windsor, features luxury single-family detached patio homes with contemporary floorplans including ranch and two-story plans. The final remaining homes range from 2,154 to 3,086 square feet, with three bedrooms and two to three bathrooms, and some plans include an office or bonus room. Residents enjoy access to Water Valley’s numerous amenities, including swim beaches, a private pool, tennis courts, fitness center, 27-holes of championship golf, and miles of walking trails. Prices start in the mid $600,000s.*

 In addition to the local shopping, dining and entertainment options in and around Windsor, both communities offer convenient access to the popular Northern Colorado cities of Fort Collins, Loveland and Greeley, and destinations that include Horsetooth Reservoir, Colorado State University and Rocky Mountain National Park.

 “Windsor is a great place to live with a welcoming community, and we enjoy being part of this special community and introducing new homebuyers to all it has to offer,” added Mulqueen.
