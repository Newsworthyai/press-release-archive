# Balfour Communities Host Dementia Training for Louisville Fire and EMS

Balfour Cherrywood Village Memory Care, a Kisco Collection, recently hosted a dementia training series for the Louisville Fire and EMS Department. In partnership with Balfour Louisville and Balfour Longmont, the training was designed to help first responders more effectively engage with individuals living with dementia during a crisis.

 “Seeing the staff’s deep caring compassion for their residents made it easy to engage with the training,” said Elizabeth Chase, Louisville firefighter-paramedic. “They gave us simple yet incredibly helpful tips on how to interact with dementia patients and bring them the best possible care.”

 The training included a presentation that guided first responders on how to appropriately approach, communicate with, and assist individuals with dementia. It was highly conversational, hands-on and practical, covering a variety of real-life scenarios and proven methods. First responders also experienced the Virtual Dementia Tour (VDT), an immersive, scientifically developed method that simulates the sensory and cognitive changes associated with dementia.

 “Thank you to our community partners at Balfour for teaching our Louisville firefighters strategies to improve their interactions with people with dementia,” said Shawn Stark, chief of EMS. “Our crews came away from the training with a better understanding and empathy for this unique patient population. The training was engaging and interactive, but we were equally impressed by the obvious devotion and advocacy shown by the Balfour staff toward the people who live in their senior communities.”

 The partnership between Balfour communities and the Louisville Fire and EMS department is a unique and valuable offering that sets these communities apart. Balfour Communities are committed to strengthening this partnership and plan to host additional dementia training sessions in the future.

 “It was an absolute honor to train our first responders and invest in a relationship that supports so many vulnerable adults in our communities,” said Brenda Gurung, national director of memory care services at Kisco Senior Living. “We shared insights, laughter, and meaningful conversations around how to better support individuals who are on a dementia journey. Working with Chief Shawn Stark and his incredible team was a true joy, and the experience continues to leave a lasting appreciation.”

 Kisco’s trademarked Heirloom Memory Care program is based in human-centered research, empathy and connection. In addition to the first responders, all associates at Balfour Communities are required to complete this Virtual Dementia Tour training to deepen their understanding of residents. The program plays a vital role in enhancing care, engagement and services by fostering empathy and equipping staff with tools to better support residents and families.
