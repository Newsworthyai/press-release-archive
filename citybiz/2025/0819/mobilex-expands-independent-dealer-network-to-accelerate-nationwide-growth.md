# MobileX Expands Independent Dealer Network to Accelerate Nationwide Growth

MobileX, the most customizable wireless service designed to save consumers money, today announced a significant expansion of its independent wireless dealer program. Revealed today at the All Wireless & Prepaid Expo, the initiative adds new master agent partnerships and dealer capabilities to fast-track national growth and strengthen support for the wireless retail channel.

 This expansion brings several new master agents into the MobileX ecosystem, including Orion Mobile, B2B Mobile, Modern Wireless and AH Prepaid. They join existing partners CTI Wireless, ePay, Unwired and Universal SIM, broadening the company’s national footprint and enabling more dealers to support onboarding, account management, troubleshooting and payments.

 MobileX is committed to the dealer community, providing partners with a brand and product built on competitive pricing, seamless activations and timely compensation. Building on this foundation, it is introducing new capabilities designed to improve operational efficiency and open additional revenue streams beyond traditional plan sales. Key enhancements include:

 * SIM Swap Capability: Easily swap pSIM and eSIM from one phone to another, streamlining service changes and improving customer satisfaction.
* Phone Number Change: Quickly change phone numbers for customers with account ID and password, delivering fast, hassle-free service.
* Dealer Care Support: Access to a dedicated, bilingual dealer care line with high customer satisfaction scores, providing fast, personalized assistance.
* Mobile Activations: Dealers asked and MobileX listened. Dealers can now activate customers directly through the mobile app via the MobileX Army*, designed to complement – not replace – current activation methods. This capability allows dealers to sign up customers anywhere and anytime, whether at events, on the street, or without immediate access to a service provider portal, maximizing revenue opportunities on the go.
* Flexible Plan Customization: Offer international service and high-speed data top-ups, which provide instant data boosts when customers run out mid-cycle, creating new revenue opportunities while keeping service uninterrupted.

 “Our independent dealer network is a vital part of our growth strategy, enabling us to reach customers with personalized service and unparalleled value,” said Michael Lanzon, Chief Marketing and Sales Officer at MobileX. “In a landscape increasingly defined by MVNO consolidation and evolving compensation models, the independent dealer channel faces unprecedented pressures. These new dealer tools, paired with our growing master agent network, position MobileX as a partner that helps retailers diversify, protect revenue streams, and offer their communities the freedom to choose exactly how they want their phone plan and wireless experience.”

 MobileX will be exhibiting at the All Wireless & Prepaid Expo at Caesars Palace on August 19-20 at Booth #628. Attendees are encouraged to visit and discover MobileX’s exclusive mobile offerings for dealers, including competitive compensation packages. MobileX’s Michael Lanzon will be speaking on the panel, “Successful Retail Trends,” on August 19. And following the show’s close on August 19, MobileX will host a cocktail mixer at the Vista Lounge inside Caesars Palace. Expo attendees can request an invitation here.

 “We’re building MobileX to be the most dealer-friendly carrier in the market,” added Jason Biado, SVP of Distribution at MobileX. “That means offering flexibility, profitability and smart tools that allow our partners to deliver better service with less friction. This expanded program reinforces our commitment to giving dealers what they need to succeed.”

 Dealers in the MobileX network offer customers exclusive, unlimited plans as well as assist customers with service onboarding, maintenance, troubleshooting, payments, and more. All dealer plans include best-in-class hotspot and are inclusive of all taxes and government surcharges.
