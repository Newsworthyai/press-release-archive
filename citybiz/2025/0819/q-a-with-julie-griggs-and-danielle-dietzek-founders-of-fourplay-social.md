# Q&amp;A with Julie Griggs and Danielle Dietzek, Founders of Fourplay Social

Julie Griggs and Danielle Dietzek are the founders of Fourplay Social, the relationship-building app and social connection platform reimagining how single people meet, date, and build community.

 Two healthcare professionals who were sparked with the idea for Fourplay just before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the two built up the app while working the frontlines. Fourplay was born out of personal frustration with the isolating nature of traditional dating apps. What started as a fun idea (turning first dates into double dates) quickly evolved into a mission-driven platform rooted in the belief that connection is essential to human well-being.

 Backed by over $1.5M in funding, Fourplay continues to gain traction by placing friendship, joy, and community at the center of how people meet. The company is guided by the U.S. Surgeon General’s Advisory on Social Connection, and its long-term vision is simple but bold: create a world where single people feel just as fulfilled and supported as those in relationships.

 Relationships are not the end goal of Fourplay, but rather a byproduct – it’s all about meeting new people, and if you end up meeting a partner for life, that is just an added bonus. Plus, what’s more fun than meeting new people with your person/best friend by your side? Fourplay is the difference between dreading another first date and looking forward to a night out with your best friend. To learn more and sign up for the app, visit fourplaysocial.com

 Tinder’s new Double Dates feature seems to mimic Fourplay on the surface. What do you think most people miss when comparing the two?

 Most people overlook how different the ethos of each brand really is. Tinder Double Date is just a feature tacked onto a one-to-one dating app. At its core, Tinder is built for fast, convenient, romantic or sexual connections, and that’s the expectation users bring to the platform.

 In contrast, Fourplay was built from day one on a completely different belief: that single life is better when it’s shared. Our focus is on the experience, not the outcome. We don’t emphasize romance or sex. Instead, we create shared adventures between friends, with the added bonus of growing your single social network, wherever that may lead!

 You’ve said that being single should “feel good, not performative or pressurized.” How did you build those values into the app’s actual design and user experience?

 We were really intentional about stripping away the elements of dating apps that create anxiety or feel like a performance. On Fourplay, singles aren’t standing alone on a digital stage trying to impress strangers; in fact, there is no such thing as an individual profile at all! Instead, they join forces with a friend and have a “team” profile from the beginning.

 Rather than presenting themselves individually, they respond to prompts about their friendship, such as “if we were a TV/movie duo, we’d be…” and “our favorite thing to do together is…”. This completely shifts the mindset from “Am I desirable?” to “We’re here to have fun.”

 In addition, we match teams, not individuals. There’s no pre-assigned “who’s with who,” because that only creates pressure, and if the pairing doesn’t click, it leads to awkwardness. On Fourplay, everyone’s simply agreeing to go out together and let the chemistry unfold in real time. If sparks fly, fantastic! If not, you still had a fun group outing with great social energy, and there’s no post-date self-critiquing or beating yourself up like traditional dating app dates often inspire.

 As healthcare providers, you bring a very different perspective to dating app culture. How has your medical background influenced Fourplay’s approach to safety and emotional wellbeing?

 Our healthcare backgrounds have shaped almost every decision we’ve made about the app. In medicine, you’re trained to look at the whole person. Physical safety, emotional wellbeing, and environment all set the context for overall health. We brought that same holistic mindset to Fourplay, but applied it specifically to singles.

 By offering a shared dating experience amongst friends, we remove many of the safety risks and social pressures that come with traditional dating app dates. And because the focus is on group experiences rather than individual performance, the entire atmosphere feels lighter, friendlier, and more supportive.

 Working the frontlines of COVID showed us firsthand how damaging loneliness can be. The U.S. Surgeon General has declared it a public health crisis, with evidence that it impacts both mental and physical health. In today’s dating app landscape, being single can feel more isolating than ever. Fourplay helps change that by connecting singles not just to new people, but also by strengthening the relationships they already have, because social connection is a fundamental human need, as essential as food, water, and shelter. Fourplay isn’t just about dating. It’s about making single life healthier.

 Many dating apps talk about fostering “connection,” but few follow through. What does authentic connection mean to you, and how do you measure it on Fourplay?

 In theory, we’ve never been more “connected,” but in practice, digital life can feel incredibly isolating. Endless swiping, superficial conversations, and dating app fatigue have replaced real-life connections with transactional interactions. Technology has streamlined communication, but it hasn’t deepened it. It often prioritizes quantity over quality (especially on apps that offer unlimited swiping), and that leaves people feeling more alone than ever.

 We started Fourplay because we believe that dating should feel more human, more fun, and more rooted in authentic connection. We measure that differently than dating apps do. To us, a “win” could be a marriage (and yes, we’re so pumped to have our first Fourplay wedding coming in 2026!), but it could also be a new friendship, a professional connection, or a single person texting their friend, “that was so fun,” on their way home from meeting their Fourplay matches. Because for us, connection isn’t only about meeting someone new; it’s also about creating shared experiences that bring you closer to the friends you already have.

 Gen Z is known for valuing authenticity and founder-led brands. How do you personally show up for users in a way that big corporate platforms can’t?

 Well, for one, we’re users on our own app We make ourselves the faces of Fourplay’s social media, sharing our single-life stories and all the behind-the-scenes of building the company in real time. Our Instagram bio has our calendar link so anyone can book a call for honest feedback on their team profile. We DM and text with our users. We ask our community for input on product decisions. We show up, literally, to every single in-person event.

 The difference is, our users don’t just know the brand, they know us. We’re not a faceless logo; we’re two real single best friends building something for people like us, not just for them, but with them. That kind of relationship is something corporate platforms will never be able to replicate.

 In your view, why is it so hard for legacy dating apps to pivot away from the hookup-focused reputation they’ve built?

 Legacy dating apps have spent years cementing their brand identities around a certain kind of dating experience: fast, convenient, gamified, and outcome-focused. That brand image is so deeply ingrained that when people hear their names, they instantly think of a specific “style” or specific expectation related to it. Shifting that perception is incredibly difficult because, in branding, perception is reality.

 Aside from hook-up focused apps, many platforms have long marketed themselves as the place to “find love,” but singles are savvy enough to recognize that this promise runs counter to their business model. If someone actually finds a lasting relationship, they stop using the app, so the entire product experience has been built to keep people engaged, swiping, and coming back, rather than facilitating genuine, lasting connection.

 It’s not just a marketing problem; it’s a product problem. Their core designs, algorithms, and revenue structures reward quantity over quality, speed over depth. To truly pivot would mean overhauling the way the product works, the brand’s core values, how it’s monetized, and how success is measured, which is a huge operational and financial risk.

 Friendship is at the heart of your platform’s DNA. How does building in pairs change the dynamics of meeting new people?

 Building in pairs fundamentally shifts the tone and purpose of meeting new people. On traditional dating apps, the focus is often on high-pressure one-on-one interactions, which often end up feeling awkward, unsafe, or overly outcome-driven. When expectations aren’t met, everyone leaves feeling like it was a waste of time. By letting friends team up to meet other singles together, Fourplay has turned the experience into more of a social outing than an “audition,” where every night, regardless of the outcome, is worth it because you did something memorable with a friend.

 The buddy system immediately increases safety, reduces the anxiety that can come with meeting strangers, and makes it easier for people to show up as their authentic selves. It also expands people’s horizons; when you’re meeting another pair, you might be intrigued by one person on-app and find yourself vibing with someone entirely different in-person. That’s because real chemistry doesn’t happen on a phone; an in-person meeting is the only true test for whether it’s there.

 By approaching new connections with a friend by their side, people are more relaxed, more open, and more willing to engage in real conversation. That creates an atmosphere where connections, whether they’re romantic, platonic, or professional, can grow more naturally and meaningfully.

 What do you think singles today need most from the dating space that they aren’t currently getting?

 Singles today need experiences that let them figure out if there’s actual chemistry with someone, almost like “foreplay” before a real date. They need the shared context that used to exist before dating apps, where meeting someone didn’t automatically come with the label of a “first date.”

 What’s missing is an environment that encourages organic, in-person interaction and recognizes that connection is multifaceted. It can be romantic, platonic, or professional. They also need platforms that prioritize emotional and physical safety without killing the fun. Too often, safety is treated as an afterthought, or “connection” is narrowly defined as finding a partner. Singles deserve experiences that reduce pressure, expand their social circles, and allow chemistry to reveal itself in real life, not just on a screen.

 Fourplay is fun, but it’s also built on safety and wellbeing. How do you balance lighthearted, social energy with the serious responsibility of protecting users?

 At Fourplay, fun and safety aren’t competing priorities, they’re intertwined. Our backgrounds in healthcare mean we’ve spent our careers protecting people’s wellbeing, and we brought that same mindset to building our platform. The “pair up” model is inherently safer than meeting a stranger one-on-one. It’s the buddy system applied to modern dating, lowering risk while also lowering social pressure.

 We keep the experience lighthearted and social because joy and connection are essential to wellbeing, but behind the scenes, we’ve put careful thought into every touchpoint: from limiting exposure to endless swiping, to curating in-person events where the environment is inclusive, respectful, and supportive. For us, “fun” isn’t just entertainment, it’s part of a healthier, safer single life.

 Since “safety” and “overall health” are more serious terms, we use a cheeky sense of humor in all of our copy, social media content, and advertising (and, of course, our NAME!) to balance that.

 Looking ahead, how do you see the future of dating and social connection evolving—and where does Fourplay fit in that vision?

 The future of dating will move toward more intentional, real-world connection and less digital performance. We’re already seeing fatigue from limitless swipe culture and transactional matches. These days people want experiences, not just outcomes; they want to meet in ways that feel natural, safe, and community-driven.

 Fourplay is built for that shift. By centering friendship and shared experiences, we’re creating an alternative to the high-pressure, high-stakes meet-up. Whether that leads to romance, new friendships, or professional connections, we’re helping people integrate connection into their everyday lives.

 As the line between “dating” and “socializing” blurs, we see Fourplay not as a dating app, but as a social wellness brand – one that strengthens community, combats loneliness, and helps people build richer, more connected lives, no matter their relationship status.
