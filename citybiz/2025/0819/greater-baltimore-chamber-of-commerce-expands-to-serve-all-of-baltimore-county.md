# Greater Baltimore Chamber of Commerce Expands To Serve All of Baltimore County

The Greater Baltimore Chamber of Commerce (GBCC) is proud to announce its strategic expansion to serve the entire Baltimore County business community, as well as a unifying force and advocate for local businesses and regional economic development at a critical moment in the county’s growth.

 Founded in 1977, GBCC has long supported business leaders, entrepreneurs, and organizations across northwest Baltimore County. Under the leadership of Dr. Beth Rheingold, President & CEO of GBCC, this expansion builds on that strong foundation by extending GBCC’s reach and services to businesses throughout the full geographic footprint of Baltimore County.

 “Due to our commitment to inclusion, economic opportunity, and achieving results for businesses of all sizes and sectors across Baltimore County, we are well-positioned to amplify a unified voice for businesses,” said Beth Rheingold, Ph.D., President & CEO of GBCC. “We are honored to serve our broader business community and deliver the same integrity, energy, and hands-on support that our members have come to expect. We are greater, together.”

 GBCC’s expansion comes at a time of transition within the region’s evolving chamber landscape. Businesses throughout the county are invited to join a dynamic, forward-thinking chamber that prioritizes relationships, results, and legislative advocacy.

 As part of this expansion, GBCC is strengthening its services, staff capabilities and engagement tools for new and existing members, including:

 * A refreshed website and directory to increase visibility for local businesses (August 2025).
* Streamlined member communications and event registration.
* The launch of a new customer-facing platform promoting member businesses (Fall 2025).
* A swiftly growing network of county-widebusiness professionals; county-wide networking events; and advocacy initiatives across Baltimore County.
* GBCC has been recognized with a 2025 Candid Silver Seal of Transparency signifying an important level of organizational transparency for its members and partners.

 Dr. Rheingold recently completed a four-year professional development program through the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Institute for Organizational Management (IOM), earning an internationallyrecognized certificate held by top leaders in the chamber and association world. In addition, GBCCrecently welcomed Ariana Sakhi as Membership & Events Coordinator, who will serve as a dedicated point of contact for all member inquiries and support needs.

 “We believe that by connecting businesses across the entire county, we can strengthen economic opportunity, visibility, and growth,” said Kimberly Fernandez, Chair of the Greater Baltimore Chamber of Commerce Board and Founder of the Girlkin Lashes franchise.“Our dynamic Board of Directors embraces transparency and is deeply committed to fulfilling its fiduciary responsibilities. We take seriously our duty of care, and we are proud to model the kind of ethical, engaged leadership that builds trust and long-term sustainability.”

 GBCC’s office remains proudly located in Pikesville, MD, positioning the Chamber within easy reach of I-695, Baltimore County government offices, and the communities that make up Baltimore County. Due to GBCC’s strong commitment to commercial revitalization, and the vital role chambers play in supporting Community Revitalization Districts (CRDs), the organization has no plans to relocate at this time.
