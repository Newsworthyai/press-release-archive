# Catalyst Power Acquires 4.5 MW Cogeneration Portfolio, Expands Northeast CHP Footprint

Catalyst Power Holdings, an independent provider of retail energy and complementary energy solutions for commercial and industrial customers, has acquired a 4.5 megawatt portfolio of operational and in-development cogeneration (CHP) projects from Aegis Energy Services. The acquisition expands Catalyst Power’s footprint in key Northeast markets and builds on its recent growth momentum following a strategic investment from DRW Holdings LLC, joining BP Energy Partners.

 Cogeneration—also known as combined heat and power (CHP)—produces electricity and heat from a single fuel source. By capturing and reusing waste heat, CHP systems can achieve efciencies of up to 90%, helping reduce energy costs and emissions for buildings with signicant heating or cooling demands.

 “CHP is a practical, proven solution for businesses facing rising energy costs and aging infrastructure,” said Gabriel Phillips, CEO of Catalyst Power. “This acquisition allows us to deliver efcient, resilient onsite energy to more customers across the region.”

 Catalyst Power is an independent energy solutions provider that integrates retail electricity with commercial energy solutions, helping businesses reduce costs and generate revenue with no upfront investment. Their turnkey CHP systems deliver efcient, resilient onsite energy tailored to each customer’s needs.
