# Q&amp;A with Rick Wargo, Managing Partner and Global Practice Co-Leader at Boyden

Rick Wargo is a Managing Partner and Global Practice Co-Leader within the Technology Practice for Boyden, a leading global executive search firm. Rick Wargo combines extensive executive search experience with a decades-long career in technology as an executive and entrepreneur. This background gives him an in-depth understanding of leadership demands and team dynamics in the hypercompetitive technology industry. He possesses exceptional ability to make nuanced, fact-based assessments of candidates for senior-level and director roles.

 Tell us a bit about your background and area of expertise – how did you start working at Boyden?

 I launched Boyden’s Seattle office roughly five years ago and lead the firm’s global Technology Practice. My entire career has been spent in the world of information technology with a 20+ year operational career touching hardware, software, consulting, and IT services as both an executive and entrepreneur.

 Following a couple of successful exits, I moved into executive search; spent significant time with two of the SHREKs (top five largest global search firms); founded and ran my own boutique; and about 5 years ago, joined Boyden because of its global boutique business model and collaborative culture.

 The 2025 AI Index Report says “business is all in on AI.” From your perspective, what does that mean for executive leadership today?

 We are seeing a fundamental shift in what boards and stakeholders now expect from leadership. AI is no longer considered an experimental technology sitting on the periphery; it has become a core driver of strategy, operations, and competitive advantage.

 This means that executive leaders are increasingly evaluated not only on their ability to deliver traditional financial and operational results, but also on their fluency with AI’s possibilities and limitations, and their ability to integrate it responsibly into business models. Leaders must be able to articulate a clear vision of how AI supports growth, efficiency, and innovation, while also managing the ethical, regulatory, and cultural considerations that come with it.

 Given the rapidly increasing use of AI, how should organizations consider the development of a role that oversees the use of the tech within the company?

 The unfettered access to and rapid acceleration of AI adoption make it clear that organizations can no longer treat oversight of the technology as a secondary responsibility buried within IT or business unit roles. Establishing a dedicated executive-level role – whether it’s a Chief AI Officer or an expanded mandate for an existing leader – ensures that AI strategy, governance, and risk management are aligned with broader business objectives.

 The role should be designed to act as a bridge between technology teams and the business units driving growth, and be responsible not only for accelerating innovation but also for ensuring the company’s values and commitments are embedded in every AI-driven decision. Done well, this role creates both accountability and competitive advantage.

 When considering the development of the C-suite, what position should AI strategy fall under? CTO/CHRO, or should companies create a new role that oversees AI entirely?

 There’s really no one-size-fits-all answer to where AI strategy should sit within the C-suite, because the right structure depends heavily on a company’s industry, maturity, and strategic priorities. In some organizations—particularly those where AI is deeply tied to product development and infrastructure—it makes sense for the Chief Technology Officer to lead.

 In others, where the focus is on workforce transformation, employee productivity, and change management, the Chief Human Resources Officer might be best positioned to oversee AI adoption. In highly regulated sectors or amongst companies undergoing large-scale digital transformation, a dedicated role such as a Chief AI Officer or Chief Data & AI Officer can provide the focus and accountability required to manage both innovation and risk.

 What qualities or experiences should companies look for in a leader who will be responsible for driving AI strategy?

 When identifying a leader to drive AI strategy, companies should look first for someone with the ability to bridge disciplines—an executive who is conversant in both the technical and business implications of AI. That doesn’t mean they must be an engineer or data scientist, but they should be fluent enough in the technology to ask the right questions, interpret insights, and challenge assumptions.

 Just as important is a proven track record of leading large-scale transformation, because deploying AI isn’t simply about tools—it’s about rethinking processes, decision-making, and how the organization creates value. Strategic vision, paired with the ability to operationalize change, is essential. Finally, qualities tied to governance, ethics, and trust are imperative.

 What role does executive search play in helping organizations find the right AI-savvy leaders in such a fast-moving space?

 Identifying and properly assessing both cultural and technical fit, leadership competencies, and recruiting top talent has never been easy. Add to that, the complexity of the business, technical, leadership, and ethical skillset demanded by these AI leadership roles and the task becomes even harder.

 Traditional leadership pipelines haven’t caught up with the demands of AI proliferation, so search firms are providing both the perspective and reach needed to help boards and CEOs refine what “AI-ready leadership” actually looks like for their organization and fill these critical roles.

 Are there specific industries or sectors where you’re seeing the most demand for AI-capable executives?

 We’re seeing demand for AI-capable executives across nearly every sector with a few being more prominent.

 * Financial services, for example, is deeply engaged in leveraging AI for risk modeling, fraud detection, and personalized client experiences, making leadership with strong digital and regulatory acumen highly sought after.
* Healthcare and life sciences are another hot spot, where organizations are exploring AI for everything from drug discovery to patient care.
* Consumer-facing industries such as retail, media, and technology are also pushing hard, as they look to harness AI to deepen customer engagement and optimize operations.

 At the same time, we’re seeing increasing demand in sectors where AI adoption has the potential to fundamentally reshape legacy models.

 * Manufacturing, energy, and logistics are seeking executives who can deploy AI to drive efficiency, predictive maintenance, and supply chain resilience.
* Even industries historically slower to embrace digital transformation, such as government and education, are beginning to prioritize leaders with the vision and skill set to integrate AI responsibly.

 Looking ahead, how do you see the role of executive search evolving as AI becomes more embedded in every facet of business?

 As AI adoption accelerates across every industry, the role of executive search will evolve to acting as a strategic advisor on the leadership capabilities companies need to thrive in a technology-driven world. It will be less about matching résumés to job descriptions and more about guiding boards and CEOs in redefining roles, assessing digital and AI fluency, and understanding how emerging technologies reshape the skills required to lead effectively. We’ll also see search firms place greater emphasis on leadership assessment and development, not just placement. As the demand for AI-savvy executives outpaces supply, organizations will need to consider how to upskill current leaders and build succession pipelines capable of carrying AI strategies forward.

 Ultimately, the integration of AI into business isn’t just about technology…it’s about leadership. Organizations that thrive in this new era will be those that place the right leaders at the helm: individuals who understand AI’s potential, who can embed it responsibly into strategy and culture, and who inspire confidence through times of rapid change. Executive search has a vital role to play in shaping that future. As the pace of innovation accelerates, one truth is clear: the leaders who can navigate AI thoughtfully and strategically will define the next chapter of business success.
