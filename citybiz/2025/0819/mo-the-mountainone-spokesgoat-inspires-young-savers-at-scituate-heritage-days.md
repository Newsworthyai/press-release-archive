# Mo the MountainOne Spokesgoat Inspires Young Savers at Scituate Heritage Days

MountainOne’s Storybook Team entertained and educated a captivated audience of children during the recent Scituate Heritage Days summer festival with a reading of “Something to Save,” the second book in MountainOne’s original storybook series.

 The story follows Mo the Spokesgoat and his friend Penny the Chipmunk as they learn about saving money, planning ahead, and making thoughtful choices. The book is part of MountainOne’s growing Storybook Program, designed to help children build early financial awareness in a fun, approachable way.

 Brenda Petell, MountainOne’s vice president and community engagement officer, coordinated and led the August 2 reading with the assistance of Scituate branch manager Devon Stone. Young audience members were encouraged to share and discuss what they enjoy saving for, sparking conversations about setting goals and making thoughtful choices.

 A highlight of the event was an appearance by Mo the Spokesgoat, who brought smiles to the crowd and plenty of photo opportunities.

 “What a pleasure it was to see the delight on the children’s faces, especially when Mo arrived,” said Petell. “It is so gratifying to know that through our storybook series, we’re helping to financially educate the next generation.”
