# Feds Target Maryland Ticket Broker in Alleged Price-Gouging Scheme

The Federal Trade Commission sued a Maryland ticket reseller, alleging it deployed an elaborate scheme to corner the market on high-demand concert seats, including those for Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour and Bruce Springsteen’s 2023 stadium shows.

 In a complaint filed Monday, the FTC accused Key Investment Group of using thousands of fake accounts, proxy servers, and virtual credit cards to evade Ticketmaster’s purchase limits. Regulators say the company acquired nearly 380,000 tickets between late 2022 and 2023, spending about $57 million and reselling them for roughly $64 million.

 The agency contends the bulk-buying spree violated the Better Online Ticket Sales Act, a 2016 law aimed at curbing scalpers’ use of automated software. The case is among the first major tests of the statute, which has rarely been enforced.

 Key Investment Group allegedly bought more than 2,000 Swift tickets across 38 shows in 2023, paying $745,000 and reselling them for nearly $2 million. At one Bruce Springsteen concert at New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium, the company secured more than 1,500 tickets through 277 accounts, reselling them for about $21,000 in revenue, according to the complaint.

 FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson said the case underscores the agency’s commitment to policing ticket markets. “Unscrupulous middlemen who harm fans and jack up prices through anticompetitive methods will hear from us,” he said.

 Key Investment Group has previously disputed the allegations, calling the FTC’s interpretation of the law “flawed” and defending its practices as consistent with industry norms. The company didn’t respond to requests for comment Monday.

 The lawsuit comes as the Biden administration’s successor has intensified scrutiny of the live-events industry, targeting ticketing platforms, promoters and venues. Swift’s Eras Tour alone has become emblematic of the frustrations fans face with limited supply and soaring resale prices.

 What Is the BOTS Act? Congress passed the Better Online Ticket Sales Act in 2016 after a string of high-profile complaints from consumers unable to buy seats to marquee events. The law makes it illegal to use automated tools to bypass ticket-purchase limits. Enforcement, however, has been sparse, with only a handful of cases pursued before the FTC’s latest action.
