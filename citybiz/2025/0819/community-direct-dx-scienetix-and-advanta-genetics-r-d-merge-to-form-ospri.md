# Community Direct DX, Scienetix, and Advanta Genetics R&amp;D Merge To Form ‘Ospri’

Community Direct DX (CDx), Scienetix, and the R&D division of Advanta Genetics have merged to form OSPRI, a next-generation biotechnology company and one of the world’s first fully vertically-integrated molecular testing platforms. Specializing in polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based infectious disease detection, OSPRI develops and delivers advanced tools that improve access to high-quality care across key healthcare segments, including women’s health, primary care, urgent care, urology, hospitals, and clinical reference laboratories.

 In addition to assay development, OSPRI delivers an end-to-end solution—covering manufacturing, lab buildout, revenue cycle management, and regulatory support—empowering providers to operate high-complexity labs in-house with greater speed, accuracy, and financial control.

 “PCR testing is foundational for infectious disease detection, but cost and complexity have kept it out of reach for many,” said Steve M. Sorey, Partner at OSPRI. “To unlock widespread adoption, we must reduce both. At OSPRI, we’re obsessed with doing more with less—making PCR faster, cheaper, and better for everyone involved.”

 The merger is financed by up to $30 million of strategic funding from Catalio Capital Management, a leading healthcare investment firm with deep expertise in diagnostics. This partnership will support OSPRI’s continued growth, platform development, and national expansion.

 “OSPRI delivers a powerful solution for physician groups and laboratories—simplifying infectious disease testing while creating strong clinical and commercial value,” said Jonathan Blankfein, Partner at Catalio. “We’re proud to support their mission to expand access to rapid, provider-centric diagnostics.”

 OSPRI’s scientific leadership includes Dr. Rahul Sharma (Chief Science Officer), Dr. Sadia Almas (Chief Innovation Officer), and Dr. Alaina Vincent (Chief Clinical Officer). The company’s technology is redefining PCR testing through:

 * 20–50% reduction in overall testing costs
* 50–70% decrease in testing time and workflow steps
* Up to 4x increase in testing capacity
* Customized assays tailored to provider specialty and patient population
* Reduced lab errors through simplified workflows
* A comprehensive menu of 80+ PCR tests covering 250+ pathogens and AMR genes

 Built on a legacy of innovation, OSPRI unites the complementary strengths of its founding entities. With roots dating back to 2015, Community Direct DX has launched over 60 labs nationwide. Scienetix brings deep expertise in molecular bioengineering, while Advanta R&D has led advancements in high-resolution genomics and contributed to national public health initiatives.

 “Our production capabilities have grown exponentially,” said Jeremy Adamic, Partner at OSPRI. “From a limited menu and basic QC, we now deliver over 40,000 tests per day with multilayered quality control—scaling both volume and reliability.”

 Over the next 12–24 months, OSPRI plans to expand its R&D team by 40% and grow commercial operations by 25% to meet increasing demand. Headquartered in McKinney, Texas, the company currently serves clients across 20 states and multiple clinical specialties.

 “OSPRI exists to solve the real problems of cost and complexity in infectious disease testing,” said Dr. Alaina Vincent. “Innovation should be accessible—not exclusive. Our goal is to enable better, faster care for more patients by equipping providers with the tools they need to lead.”
