# DC BLOX Recognized on Inc. 5000 for Fifth Consecutive Year Among Nation’s Fastest-Growing Private Firms

DC BLOX, a leading provider of connected data centers and fiber network solutions across the Southeastern United States, today announced its inclusion in the Inc. 5000 list of Fastest-Growing Private Companies in America for the fifth consecutive year. This recognition reflects DC BLOX’s sustained expansion, innovation, and commitment to delivering essential digital infrastructure across the region.

 “Being recognized for the fifth year in a row by Inc. Magazine is a tremendous honor and a testament to the dedication of our entire team,” said Jeff Uphues, CEO of DC BLOX. “Our growth is driven by the accelerating demand for reliable, high-capacity digital infrastructure in the Southeast, and we remain steadfast in our mission to support the region’s technology investments and economic growth.”

 The Inc. 5000 list measures revenue growth over a three-year period—in this case, from 2021 to 2024—many of the milestones highlighted below extend beyond the past year. DC BLOX has continued to expand its digital infrastructure footprint, including the completion of new fiber routes, plans to develop hyperscale edge node data centers in the Southeast, and ongoing development of its Myrtle Beach Cable Landing Station campus. The company also announced its plans to build a second subsea Cable Landing Station (CLS) campus in Palm Coast, Florida. These initiatives strengthen connectivity for hyperscalers, communications providers, enterprises, and government entities, enabling next-generation applications such as high-performance computing and AI. Most recently, DC BLOX announced it had secured a $1.15 billion green loan to support the development of its Atlanta data center campus—an industry-leading, sustainable facility designed to meet the region’s growing demand for hyperscale capacity.
