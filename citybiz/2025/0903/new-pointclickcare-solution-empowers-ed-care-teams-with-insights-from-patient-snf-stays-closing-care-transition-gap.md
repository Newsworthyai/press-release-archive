# New PointClickCare Solution Empowers ED Care Teams with Insights from Patient SNF Stays, Closing Care Transition Gap

Reason for Transfer AI Model empowers ED providers to reduce avoidable readmissions and make faster, more informed care decisions

 PointClickCare, a leading health tech company helping providers deliver exceptional care, today announced its enhanced ED Optimization solution powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Leveraging the most extensive post-acute dataset in North America, this solution delivers instant, actionable, AI-informed insights from skilled nursing facility (SNF) stays directly to emergency department (ED) care teams, bridging a long-standing gap in care transitions.

 With this new capability, frontline providers receive critical, instant patient information when and where it is needed most. PointClickCare is leading the industry in harnessing AI to improve transitions of care from SNFs to hospitals, setting a new benchmark for intelligent healthcare delivery. This enables clinicians to make faster, safer decisions, reduce unnecessary admissions, and elevate the standard of emergency care across the continuum.

 “PointClickCare’s AI-informed proprietary Reason for Transfer AI Model is setting a new standard in healthcare intelligence by delivering the critical information emergency departments need — instantly. Often, EDs receive too little data, too late, or an overwhelming amount of unfiltered data, and with this enhanced solution, we are empowering providers with timely, actionable insights that streamline decision-making and elevate patient care.”

 Hamad Husainy, DO, FACEP, chief medical officer, PointClickCare

 Building on the existing SNF Stay Summary which already provides a comprehensive snapshot of a patient’s experience, including information about the facility, care providers, diagnoses, and medications, this AI innovation advances the scope and depth of patient information. ED teams now instantly receive vital updates detailing the patient’s most recent 24 hours in SNF care, offering critical insight into the context behind each transfer, allowing frontline staff to make faster, more informed care decisions.

 “Getting a real-time summary of the SNF stay — especially the reason they are in my ED — has changed how we handle post-acute transfers. We know why the patient is here, what’s been done, and what’s needed next. Having accurate medication lists, next of kin, treating physician, and reason for transfer in a single electronic location enables us to act rapidly, reduce unnecessary admissions, and safely return patients to the SNF when appropriate.”

 Gina Sulmeyer, MD, executive director of Medical Informatics at Torrance Memorial Medical Center

 This AI innovation is a critical step in PointClickCare’s mission of helping every provider deliver exceptional, patient-centered care. By harnessing powerful AI-driven insights, the company is closing critical gaps across the care continuum, reducing avoidable readmissions, and establishing itself as the leader in healthcare intelligence – particularly during high-stakes transitions of care.
