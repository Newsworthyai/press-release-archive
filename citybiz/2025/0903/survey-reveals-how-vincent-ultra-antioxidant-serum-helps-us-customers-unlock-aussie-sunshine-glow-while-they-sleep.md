# Survey Reveals How Vincent+ Ultra Antioxidant Serum Helps US Customers Unlock Aussie Sunshine Glow While They Sleep

Vincent+, the pioneering skincare brand harnessing the world’s first patented process for extracting Ultra Antioxidants from Australian apples, today released compelling customer survey results for its Ultra Antioxidant Serum. Optimized for nighttime use, the serum allows US customers to experience the revitalizing essence of “Aussie sunshine” captured in potent, natural phenolics – all while resting in the dark, where the formula works most effectively to repair and rejuvenate skin at the cellular level without interference from sunlight.

 In a market flooded with nighttime face serums, Vincent+ stands apart through its groundbreaking science. Derived from select Australian apple varieties grown in volcanic soils under intense UV light, temperature differentials, and optimal rainfall, the serum delivers the highestmost potentbroad-spectrum phenolic content available. This includes all eight synergistic phenolic antioxidants, extracted via a patented process.

 Unlike conventional antioxidants, which can lose potency or even become pro-oxidative, Vincent+’s Ultra Antioxidants boast over 90% bioavailability – making them more than 20 times more effective at neutralizing free radicals caused by environmental pollutants, diet, and biological stress.

 The customer survey underscores the serum’s real-world impact:

 * Immediate Results: 8 in 10 users reported an instant glow, improved hydration, and visibly less tired-looking skin.
* After 10 Days: 7 in 10 users experienced a significant increase in skin smoothness, suppleness, and firmness.
* After 30 Days: 9 in 10 users noted wrinkles and lines becoming less visible, along with improved skin complexion and reduced inflammation.

 “Free radicals trigger cellular inflammation, accelerating skin aging, wrinkles, and inflammation,” explains Dr. Vincent, Founder of Vincent+. “Our Ultra Antioxidants stabilize these radicals with superior hydroxyl groups, preventing damage and promoting repair. Applied at night, the serum thrives in the absence of sunlight, focusing entirely on internal cellular rejuvenation for maximum efficacy – essentially bottling the protective power of Aussie sunshine for your skin while you sleep.”

 

 Further insights from the skin quality survey highlight life-changing benefits for those with challenging conditions:

 * Among respondents dealing with itchiness, soreness, and stinging, 100% reported significant improvements, with 59% achieving complete clearance within two weeks.
* For individuals whose skin issues affected daily decisions around clothing, work, social activities, and leisure, 55% saw their concerns fully resolved within four weeks.
* 90% of those experiencing significant daily life impacts reported a reduction to minimal effects within four weeks.

 “These results affirm what our science promised: transformative, cellular-level care that goes beyond surface-level hydration,” said Dr. Vincent. “US customers now have access to authentic Australian innovation, delivering that coveted ‘sun-kissed’ vitality overnight – safely and naturally.”

 The Ultra Antioxidant Serum is lightweight, absorbs quickly without residue, and is ideal for layering in evening routines. It reduces fine lines, maintains facial volume and structural support, enhances elasticity, deeply hydrates, improves tone and clarity, and reinforces the skin barrier for lasting resilience.
