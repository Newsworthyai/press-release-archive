# Architectural Glass &amp; Metal Technician Program Continues Partnership with FHC, Hosts Testing at California Campus

North America’s only third-party personnel credential for glaziers, the Architectural Glass and Metal Technician certification program conducted hands-on glazier testing at the South Gate, California, campus of Frameless Hardware Company (FHC). The event continued the partnership between AGMT and FHC, following prior testing at FHC’s Irving, Texas, campus in January, and sponsorship of upcoming testing during GlassBuild America in Orlando, Florida, November 4-6, 2025.

 AGMT certification provides an independent assessment of a glazier’s fundamental knowledge, skills, and abilities through written and hands-on assessments. Glaziers must retest every four years to maintain certification.

 “I believe in this program and [AGMT’s] mission to elevate the glazing trade,” said FHC Chief of Marketing Andrew Haring. “As staunch advocates for education and training, we see how AGMT elevates the playing field, increases quality, and creates a standard.”

 In addition to providing the test venue, FHC covered 50 percent of testing costs for candidates.

 “We are thankful for FHC’s ongoing commitment to certification,” said AGMT Field Operations Manager Jason Simonette, who organized the testing event. “In addition to FHC’s financial contributions, the company has been a vocal advocate for the value of certification. That’s meaningful to our program and to all those who work hard to earn AGMT.”

 AGMT testing at FHC was coordinated to bring exposure and access to the program in Southern California. To date, 2,149 glaziers have earned certification, representing 41 states and four Canadian provinces. The program has experienced 12 percent growth in the first half of 2025, with 242 glaziers certified.

 Testing candidates represented Double Play Glass Co., Glazing Concepts Inc., Hale Glass, and Pacific Coast Glazing. Nine individuals earned certification during the event.
