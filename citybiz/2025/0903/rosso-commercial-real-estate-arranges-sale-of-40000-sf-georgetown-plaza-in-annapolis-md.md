# Rosso Commercial Real Estate Arranges Sale of 40,000 SF Georgetown Plaza in Annapolis, MD

Rosso Commercial Real Estate is pleased to announce the sale of Georgetown Plaza, a 40,000± square foot, two-story mixed-use property located at 914 Bay Ridge Road in Annapolis, Maryland, for approximately $4.9 million. The transaction officially closed August 29, 2025, marking the first change in ownership in decades for this long-standing neighborhood center.

 Located along the highly traveled Forest Drive corridor, Georgetown Plaza has been an established hub serving the Annapolis Neck – Bay Ridge Peninsula community for more than 30 years. The property features a mix of prominent tenants including Main & Market, Domino’s, Annapolis Family Dentistry, and several other valued businesses.

 “Georgetown Plaza is a cornerstone property for the Annapolis community, and it’s no surprise the new ownership was drawn to its excellent location, strong tenancy, and decades-long reputation,” said John Rosso, Principal of Rosso Commercial Real Estate.

 Rosso Commercial has proudly handled leasing efforts at Georgetown Plaza since 2018 under prior ownership. The firm’s Ryan Brassel & Ross Westholm represented the Seller in the off-market transaction. Looking ahead, the new ownership has also retained Ryan and Ross at Rosso Commercial as the exclusive leasing agents for the property.

 “We are honored to have represented the Seller in this meaningful transaction and are equally excited to continue working with the new ownership,” added Rosso. “We look forward to advancing Georgetown Plaza’s legacy as an important part of Annapolis’ retail and service landscape.”
