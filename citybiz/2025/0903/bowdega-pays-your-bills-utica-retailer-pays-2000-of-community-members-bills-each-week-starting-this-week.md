# Bowdega Pays Your Bills: Utica Retailer Pays $2,000 of Community Members’ Bills Each Week Starting this Week

Bowdega, a culturally inspired cannabis retail shop in Utica, today announced the launch of its “Bowdega Pays Your Bills” campaign, a new initiative aimed at giving back to the community.

 Beginning today and running through the end of the year, customers 21 and older can enter weekly drawings for a chance to receive prepaid gift cards totaling $2,000 each week. Winners will be selected at random and awarded cards valued at $50, $100, or $200 that can be used toward everyday expenses.

 “Bowdega has always been about more than cannabis. We’re about culture, community, and connection,” said Marvin Kiezi, founder of Bowdega and Burn1 Lounge. “Through Bowdega Pays Your Bills, we want to help people out in a meaningful way. If we can give back to our neighbors and make their lives just a little easier and their holidays a little brighter, that’s exactly what we want to do. Everyone deserves a break now and then and we’re excited we can make it happen.”

 Participation is simple. After shopping at Bowdega, customers can write their name and contact information on their receipt and drop it into the secure entry box located in-store. No purchase is required to participate; entries may also be submitted in-store or by mail. For complete rules or to enter to win without purchase, contact or visit Bowdega.

 Bowdega Pays Your Bills is the latest expression of Bowdega’s commitment to community, complementing the experience offered at its flagship retail store and Burn1, one of Michigan’s first licensed cannabis consumption lounges. Together, Bowdega and Burn1 provide a full-circle cannabis destination that reflects a neighborhood bodega: familiar, fast, flavorful, and community-driven.

 Location: BOWDEGA + Burn1 45411 Park Ave. Utica, Mich. 48315
