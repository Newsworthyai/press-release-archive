# Tootl Transport Rolls into Tampa Bay, Providing Safe and Dependable Rides for Those with Mobility &amp; Cognitive Challenges

Tootl Transport, a non-emergency medical transportation (NEMT) service that provides safe, wheelchair accessible rides for anyone with mobility and cognitive challenges, announces the opening of its first Florida location in Tampa Bay, which has already launched services.

 With a mission of improving lives through safe and reliable transportation for people of all abilities, and core values of Trust, Respect, Empathy, and Kindness, the new Tootl Transport location solves the transportation challenges of multiple populations. This includes seniors, wheelchair users, or anyone with temporary to chronic mobility or cognitive challenges who require specially equipped vehicles and drivers to get them safely to their destinations. Having operated successfully in the Chicago area since 2012, Tootl Transport began offering franchises in 2024 to introduce the important service to new communities across the country.

 “We couldn’t be more excited to bring Tootl Transport to Tampa Bay – an area that’s vibrant, growing, and home to so many individuals who can benefit from our specialized transportation services,” said Tootl Transport Founder, Michelle Dacy. “With Tampa Bay’s large senior population and diverse community of individuals with mobility and cognitive challenges, we were inspired to bring Tootl to a place where our strong focus on customer service and relations can truly make a difference. At Tootl, we believe that everyone deserves safe, reliable, and dignified transportation, and we can’t wait to become a trusted part of this community.”

 The opening of the Tampa Bay location marks the next step in the brand’s continued national expansion into new markets. Tootl Transport of Tampa Bay operates in Hillsborough, Pinellas and Pasco counties.
