Intention.ly, the go-to growth engine for financial services firms, is proud to mark the continued influence of In the Suite, hosted by Partner and Chief of Community, Tina Powell, and Don’t Do That, hosted by CEO and Co-Founder Kelly Waltrich. In the Suite is approaching its 100th episode, while Don’t Do That, launched just seven months ago, has reached episode 27.

 In the Suite: Inspiring Stories from Women Leaders

 Launched in March 2020, In the Suite marries host Tina Powell’s signature energy and enthusiasm with meaningful stories of courage, culture, strength, leadership, and growth from some of the industry’s most profound voices, exploring what it takes to make it to, and stay relevant in, the financial services C-suite.

 The podcast serves as a beacon of empowerment, offering strategies for career advancement, asserting their voices in the industry, and navigating personal transitions while climbing to senior leadership positions.

 Recent guests from In the Suite‘s remarkable run include Carina Diamond (GFP Private Wealth), Gene Farrell (Vanilla), Christine Benz (Morningstar), Topaz Morrison (Independent Advisor Alliance), and Vickie Lewin (Amplify). The show’s upcoming milestone 100th episode will be filmed in person and feature Powell’s mom, Joanne Sutera.

 Don’t Do That: Turning Conventional Advice Upside‑Down

 Hosted by Kelly Waltrich, Don’t Do That delivers a unique set of “what not to do” lessons from real-world leaders. Rather than recycling expert clichés or hypothetical strategies, the podcast focuses on helping listeners learn from failure through raw, real reflection.

 Bellwether episodes include conversations with innovative leaders such as Ainslie Simmonds (BNY), Eric Clarke, Heather Fortner (SignatureFD), Penny Phillips (Journey Strategic Wealth), and Mark Gilbert (Zocks), offering practical insights on recognizing and avoiding growth pitfalls, managing balance, and preserving vision in fast-growing firms. Episode 23 featured a compilation of the best moments from the show’s first 20+ guests.

 In just a few months, the Don’t Do That has developed a loyal listener base drawn to Kelly’s candid, strategy-forward approach and the no-nonsense format that empowers listeners to skip what doesn’t work and go straight to action.
