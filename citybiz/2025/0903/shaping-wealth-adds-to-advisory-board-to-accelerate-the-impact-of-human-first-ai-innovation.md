# Shaping Wealth Adds to Advisory Board to Accelerate the Impact of Human-First AI Innovation

Shaping Wealth, the leading provider of behavioral science-based learning and engagement solutions for the wealth management industry, today announced the expansion of its advisory board. Prominent industry leaders Jason Pereira, MBA, CFA, CFP®, and Samantha Russell will join behavioral economist Dr. Hal Hershfield to help guide Shaping Wealth’s strategic evolution as the company advances its proprietary AI platform, Lydia, and deepens its technology integrations.

 “The future of our industry lies not in choosing between technology and humanity, but in thoughtfully combining both to serve clients better,” said Brian Portnoy, CFA, Ph.D., founder and CEO of Shaping Wealth. “Jason, Samantha, and Hal bring decades of combined expertise in technology adoption, marketing innovation, and behavioral science. Their insights will be invaluable as we continue to scale Lydia’s impact and expand our platform to reach more advisors worldwide.”

 Jason Pereira, host of the Fintech Impact Podcast and recognized thought leader in advisor technology, brings deep expertise in digital transformation to the advisory role.

 “For decades, the evolution of the industry has been moving us further away from products and closer to the humans we serve, and artificial intelligence is only accelerating this trend,” said Pereira. “I am excited to be part of Shaping Wealth’s efforts to leverage their industry-leading knowledge on behavioral finance implementation with the power of artificial intelligence to create a more human industry.”

 Recently named to InvestmentNews’ 40 Under 40, FMG’s Chief Evangelist Samantha Russell will help inform Shaping Wealth’s go-to-market strategies and client engagement initiatives.

 “What excites me most about Shaping Wealth is their commitment to making technology more human, not less,” said Russell. “Advisors need tools that help them connect more deeply with clients, not just process information faster. Shaping Wealth’s approach to behavioral intelligence represents the future of how technology should serve our industry.”

 Dr. Hal Hershfield, Professor at UCLA Anderson School of Management, continues his advisory role with expanded responsibilities around Lydia’s behavioral intelligence framework.

 “I’ve been privileged to watch Shaping Wealth evolve over the years, and I’m confident this is exactly the right team to guide advisors through the thoughtful integration of technology and human-first guidance,” said Hershfield.

 The advisory board expansion coincides with Shaping Wealth’s strategic pivot toward AI-powered solutions, anchored by Lydia, a behavioral intelligence engine that helps advisors deliver more empathetic, personalized guidance. Unlike traditional AI tools focused solely on efficiency, Lydia enhances the emotional intelligence of financial conversations.

 “This is a pivotal moment for our industry,” added Portnoy. “With this exceptional advisory team, we’re reimagining how human insight and artificial intelligence can work together to help more people achieve funded contentment.”
