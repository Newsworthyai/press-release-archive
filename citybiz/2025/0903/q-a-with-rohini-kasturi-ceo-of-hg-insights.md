 What led HG Insights to acquire TrustRadius and MadKudu?

 HG Insights has historically provided precise Revenue Growth Intelligence (RGI) that enables companies to make strategic game-changing decisions, translating to revenue gains and improved customer retention. HG Insights’ AI-driven data, which consists of technology usage, spend, buying centers, and intent, enables customers to identify market opportunities, target high-propensity accounts, displace competitors, refine segments, optimize territory coverage, and ultimately accelerate revenue generation. However, a major challenge facing B2B companies today is bridging the gap between these insights and marketing and sales execution—specifically detecting accounts and buyers actively in-market or evaluating competitive solutions.

 And that’s why we acquired TrustRadius and MadKudu, uniting HG Insights’ unparalleled market, account intelligence with TrustRadius’ reliable B2B buyer intelligence and agentic workflows. This strategic acquisition creates a definitive Go-to-Market (GTM) platform for B2B marketing, sales, strategy, and RevOps teams focused on driving efficient growth, especially in crowded markets.

 How will HG Insights’ acquisition of TrustRadius and MadKudu impact your data-driven insights and benefit your customer base?

 With TrustRadius and MadKudu becoming part of HG Insights, demand generation and sales teams gain a powerful combination of contextualized buyer insights, in-market leads, and predictive scoring that accelerates pipeline and revenue outcomes. TrustRadius brings the authentic voice of the customer through validated reviews and intent data, while MadKudu adds advanced predictive intelligence to qualify and prioritize opportunities with precision.

 The combined data unlocks new levels of efficiency for marketing and sales—helping teams not only identify target accounts and accounts at risk of churn, but also understand which prospects are most likely to convert and when. HG Insights customers can connect directly with active buyers via TrustRadius, while leveraging MadKudu’s AI-driven scoring to focus resources on the highest-impact opportunities.

 The result is a unified, end-to-end GTM solution that enables teams to move seamlessly from market analysis to buyer engagement, to revenue attainment—with greater accuracy, speed, and confidence.

 How does HG Insights differentiate itself from competitors in the B2B market intelligence space?

 Our mission is to build the industry’s preeminent AI-driven revenue growth intelligence platform. This requires unlocking the holy grail for demand gen and sales—connecting sellers to the right buyers who are ready to purchase. With TrustRadius joining HG Insights, we are uniquely positioned with optimal data sets and buyer intent contextualization to deliver high-propensity accounts and in-market leads that provide the fastest path to revenue.

 GTM teams can now leverage industry-leading buyer intent data and in-market lead generation within HG Insights’ RGI platform to identify, prioritize, and engage best-fit accounts—bridging the gap between strategic planning and GTM execution and helping companies accelerate revenue generation. We are the only end-to-end platform that empowers B2B buyers and sellers with deeper, more actionable intelligence.

 Can you tell us about Revenue Growth Intelligence (RGI) and why you view it as a market disruptor?

 Today’s market, sales, account, and competitive intelligence tools are all fragmented and siloed – causing complexity and GTM misalignment. In contrast, RGI captures, integrates, and processes massive, diverse and granular data points across these otherwise separate domains.

 Organizations can take advantage of RGI data to simplify and strengthen GTM execution to identify market opportunities, focus outbound marketing initiatives, build customer retention, and improve GTM efficiency.

 RGI utilizes advanced analytics to detect and incorporate deep “behind the firewall” customer data, allowing for precise marketing and account targeting, extracting insights about technographics, cloud usage, and competitive intelligence, including contract and services data. With the release of RGI Fabric, we believe that we are spearheading the next wave of precision-guided, AI-assisted GTM growth and decision making.

 Describe your vision for the company as the technology landscape continues to evolve.

 At HG Insights, our vision is clear: to empower B2B companies to accelerate revenue growth through unparalleled data and AI-driven insights. We’re committed to delivering intelligence that enables our customers and their partners to scale revenue efficiently, strengthen customer retention, and enhance operational execution.

 With the acquisitions of TrustRadius and MadKudu, we’ve entered a transformative phase that extends this vision even further. TrustRadius brings the authentic voice of the customer through validated reviews and buyer intent, while MadKudu adds predictive intelligence that helps revenue teams qualify, prioritize, and convert opportunities with unmatched accuracy. Together, these capabilities fuel an adaptive Agentic Mesh — a system of intelligent, persona-aligned agents designed to drive outcomes across Revenue Growth, Customer Retention, and Operational Efficiency. These agentic solutions will deliver the fastest time-to-revenue, proactive churn prevention, and 10x ROI as well as 100x agility for our customers through AI + data-powered execution.

 Everything we’ve launched to date lays the groundwork for this evolution. Our Revenue Growth Intelligence Fabric, Market Analyzer Copilot, Buyer Intelligence-Driven In-Market Funnel Leads, MadKudu’s Data Studio and Sales Co-pilot and TrustRadius’ Buyer Intelligence form the infrastructure for the next era of go-to-market. We anticipate the rise of Revenue Growth Agentic Solutions that are context-aware and dynamically adapt to business conditions. These solutions plug into platforms like ABM, CDP, and GTM execution tools, delivering actionable, end-to-end insights and workflows.

 The ultimate goal? To deliver measurable ROI, unlock faster revenue, boost retention and efficiency, and amplify the impact of every GTM motion.

 How does HG Insights help GTM leaders approach complex decision-making/growth strategies and where do demand gen and sales come into play for HG Insights’ impact?

 The advent of AI, big data, and advanced analytics is changing how executives and growth teams operationalize and act on data about markets, trends, technographics, and competitors. HG Insights bridges the gap between macro-level Market Intelligence sources (such as industry analyst reports) that are largely strategic and not actionable, and Sales / Account intelligence tools (such as intent and contact providers) that are mostly surface level while lacking granular information on spend, trends, location, and wallet share.

 In contrast, our RGI Fabric takes a bottom-up market data approach to allow analytics to surface more granular market and account-level insights necessary to modernize GTM strategy and execution.

 HG Insights’ RGI has significant impact across all data-driven GTM roles:

 * Marketing: Improves ABM performance and targeting by supplying “behind-the-firewall” competitive, contracts info and technographics data – for more precise account scoring, data enrichment, and execution of digital campaigns
* RevOps: Provides unparalleled segment-level trend and market-sizing data for business forecasting, market selection, account planning, and territory optimization
* Sales: Supports deep opportunity scoring, account insights, and granular account data enrichment and technographics, vital in today’s crowded and dynamic markets. This enables sales teams to perform account planning and execute sales plays, including whitespace, expansion, and displacement programs
* GTM / Strategy: Provides high-quality information such as TAM, SAM, SOM, Competitive Analysis, Resource Allocation, and more

 What role has the rapid acceleration of AI had in the success of your company and how can marketers use HG Insights’ solutions to adapt and gain a competitive B2B edge?

 Unleashing developer creativity in product development has enabled us to solve complex systemic problems (especially for our SaaS offering) that previously would have taken months to resolve. Building well-orchestrated AI tooling for system testing has ensured we consistently deliver quality products to market.

 The acceleration we’ve seen across functional areas—from marketing campaigns and sales plays to hiring practices and productivity tools—has delivered significant efficiency gains throughout the organization.

 We recently launched the Market Analyzer and Copilot. The AI-native product draws from HG Insights’ RGI Fabric of over 28 billion market source files, 2 billion intent records, 20+ million companies, and 200+ million tech install and IT spend detections. RGI utilizes advanced AI/ML technologies to detect and incorporate deep “behind the firewall” customer data, allowing for precise marketing and account targeting, extracting insights about technographics, cloud usage, competitive intelligence, and more.

 Can you share how the B2B buyer intent data from TrustRadius will bolster HG Insights’ solutions following the acquisition and what tech trends are on your radar to help us stay ahead of the curve??

 TrustRadius brings a powerful layer of bottom-funnel B2B buyer intent signals that are representative of actual technology buyers conducting product research and making a purchase decision. By integrating this intent data into HG Insights’ RGI platform, we’re enabling customers to go beyond signals of who might be in-market, to understanding who is actively evaluating solutions, and what really matters to them during purchase decisions. We are bridging the execution gap between market intelligence and buyer engagement, helping our clients prioritize accounts with precision and accelerate revenue growth.

 Several trends are gaining significant momentum. Organizations are intensifying their search for measurable ROI from AI investments, moving beyond experimentation to demonstrate concrete business value. There’s also growing focus on incorporating AI at the application layer to explore what truly AI-native software architecture will look like in the future. Additionally, there is an increased emphasis on mapping specialized models to domain-specific problems while implementing proper guardrails to ensure reliable, safe deployment.

 Eventually, go-to-market processes will evolve to agentic workflows, and we are pioneering the technical foundations to support agentic ecosystems. We have accelerated our AI capabilities with the recent acquisition of MadKudu to revolutionize the GTM tech stack. We are reshaping how GTM teams plan, execute, and measure success—particularly in automating insights at scale so teams can take action quickly. We’re also keeping a close eye on advancements in data interoperability to ensure our customers can trust and activate data seamlessly with a unified GTM platform.
