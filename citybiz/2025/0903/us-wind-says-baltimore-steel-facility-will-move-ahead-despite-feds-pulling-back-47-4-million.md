# US Wind Says Baltimore Steel Facility Will Move Ahead, Despite Feds Pulling Back $47.4 Million

The developer of a planned Maryland offshore wind farm insisted Tuesday that a related steel manufacturing facility in Sparrows Point will move forward, despite the federal government withdrawing a $47.4 million grant for the project last week.

 The Sparrows Point Steel Marshalling Project was one of a dozen projects targeted by the U.S. Department of Transportation Friday when it withdrew $679 million in previously approved grants for port and rail infrastructure improvements in support of wind power projects across the country.

 In announcing the cuts, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said they were part of a Trump administration effort to slash funding for “doomed” offshore wind farms.

 The administration of President Joe Biden “bent over backwards to use transportation dollars for their Green New Scam agenda while ignoring the dire needs of our shipbuilding industry,” Duffy said in a statement Friday. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

 But US Wind, the Baltimore-based wind farm developer behind the Sparrows Point project, was defiant Tuesday. It said the $400 million project planned for nearly 100 acres on the site of the former Bethlehem Steel mill “will continue to move forward, ultimately bringing hundreds of manufacturing jobs to the Baltimore region.”

 The company added that steel manufactured on the site would also fuel the shipbuilding industry.

 “There continues to be a robust market for steel components for the energy and shipbuilding industries, and US Wind is confident that just as steel has been a key part of the region’s past, Sparrows Point Steel will be an important part of Maryland’s industrial future,” wrote Nancy Sopko, US Wind’s vice president for external affairs, in a statement.
