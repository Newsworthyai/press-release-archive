# weBoost Launches Dash to Keep Users Connected, Charged, and Moving

weBoost, the leader in cell signal booster technology, proudly announces the latest in cell signal boosting and wireless device charging — the weBoost Dash. Engineered to deliver priority connectivity and seamless charging for drivers on the go, this innovation in boosting technology keeps commuters, delivery drivers, and road warriors connected without compromise from dead zones and dead batteries.

 Designed to focus signal boosting power on a single device across all North American carriers, the Dash delivers clearer calls, faster data speeds up to 5G, and fewer dropped connections. The advanced signal booster features a magnetic Qi2 charger for wireless charging at 15W, all while prioritizing stronger signal for the device. And, with the ultra-secure outside antenna magnetic mount, installation takes seconds with no drilling or adhesives required.

 “Dash really is designed for the everyday drive,” said Jonathan Field, weBoost General Manager. “From high-powered executives in luxury sedans to families in minivans, staying connected during the daily hustle and bustle is critical. This product allows drivers to experience seamless connectivity and worry-free battery life on every journey, whether it’s a daily commute or a cross-country adventure.”

 Key Features Include:

 * Single-Device Focus: Concentrates all boosting power on one device for maximum signal strength, delivering clearer calls, faster data speeds up to 5G, and fewer dropped connections.
* Integrated Wireless Charging: Built-in Magnetic Qi2 Wireless Charger keeps devices powered throughout the drive, compatible with iPhone 13-16, Samsung Galaxy S25, Google Pixel 10, and other Qi2-enabled devices.
* Effortless Installation: Ultra-secure magnetic mount installs and removes in seconds with no drilling, no adhesives, and no complicated setup required.
* Universal Compatibility: Works with all cellular devices and major U.S. and Canadian carrier networks, ensuring reliable connectivity regardless of provider.
* Seamless Integration: Sleek, low-profile design blends into any vehicle type from luxury sedans to delivery vans.
