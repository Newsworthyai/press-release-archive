# Menlo Security Teams Up with Google Cloud to Use Gemini AI for Enhanced Phishing Protection

Menlo Security, the industry leader in Secure Enterprise Browsers, today announced an expanded integration with Google Cloud. Menlo Security HEAT Shield AI now leverages Google Cloud’s Vertex platform with Gemini models, expanding its phishing and credential theft prevention capabilities against zero-hour “social engineering” and brand impersonation” attacks that target users via the browser.

 Menlo Security is also releasing Menlo Sidekick, an AI-powered, natural language agent to simplify and streamline security analytics, and also leveraging the Vertex platform with Gemini models. Threat actors are rapidly evolving their tactics, employing sophisticated social engineering and brand impersonation attacks that often bypass traditional, signature-based security tools. Menlo Security HEAT Shield AI has long provided protection against these zero-hour phishing attacks by closing the security gap that traditional network security tools leave open. With the integration of the Gemini models, Menlo is taking threat prevention capabilities a significant step further. This new integration allows Menlo HEAT Shield AI to leverage the advanced capabilities of Google’s Gemini models to deliver a new level of in-browser threat detection with even greater accuracy.

 “Social engineering and brand impersonation attacks are becoming increasingly convincing and difficult to detect with traditional security measures,” said Ramin Farassat, Chief Product Officer at Menlo Security. “By collaborating with Google Cloud, and integrating Menlo HEAT Shield AI with Google Cloud’s Vertex AI platform and Google’s Gemini models, Menlo is able to identify and block over 99.5% of these novel threats as they happen, right inside the browser. Examples of these threats include fake CAPTCHA pages, or fraudulent remote tech support scams designed to steal credentials, protecting our customers from attacks that would have been impossible to stop just a few months ago.” This enhanced capability provides advanced protection against zero-hour social engineering and brand impersonation attacks.

 Menlo Sidekick makes it easy to analyze the massive volume of data generated by browser traffic. Security teams often struggle to sift through billions of event logs to find critical insights. Menlo Sidekick, enabled by Gemini, accelerates workflows for administrators and Security Operation teams. Administrators can now easily describe what they are looking for, reducing the time and expertise needed to perform critical tasks like identifying threats, analyzing platform usage, and creating detailed security reports.

 “Menlo Sidekick is a game-changer,” continued Farassat. “It will empower Menlo users to easily explore the rich data within the Menlo Security platform, accelerate investigations and help identify risky behavior without having to be an MQL expert. The language translation capabilities of Google’s Gemini models also allow users to work in their preferred language, further expanding the accessibility and value of our platform.”

 “As businesses integrate AI into their core operations, they face a new set of security challenges,” said Vineet Bhan, Director of Security and Identity Partnerships at Google Cloud. “Our partnership with Menlo Security is important to addressing this, giving customers the advanced tools needed to protect their data, maintain control, and innovate confidently in the era of AI.”These new integrations are among the latest examples of the ongoing collaboration between Menlo Security and Google Cloud, which is focused on leveraging cutting-edge AI capabilities to simplify security and protect organizations from advanced browser-based threats.
