# Orange County United Way Launches “UNITED4OC 2030”

Orange County United Way today announced “UNITED4OC 2030,” a bold, countywide five-year strategic plan which outlines a vision to cultivate a stronger workforce, healthier economy, and improved well-being for all of Orange County. The organization is calling on individuals, businesses and community leaders to join forces in tackling the county’s most pressing issues.

 At the heart of UNITED4OC 2030 is an ambitious goal: to create 4 million moments of impact by 2030 to build a stronger, more resilient community. Whether it’s attending an educational event, making a financial donation, volunteering your time, or mentoring a student, every action makes a meaningful difference.

 “UNITED4OC 2030 will pave the way for a stronger and more united future for all,” said Lawrence R. Armstrong, Board Chair of Orange County United Way. “We invite the community to join us throughout this five-year journey, making moments of impact by investing time and resources alongside friends and neighbors so that together we can improve lives in Orange County today and for generations to come.”

 To kick off the movement, nearly 500 people collectively participated in family-friendly two-mile walks in all 34 Orange County cities on September 6. Orange County United Way executives and staff, local elected officials, community members and media were in attendance.

 “Orange County United Way is well positioned to drive meaningful change and fill critical gaps to ensure everyone in our community has the chance to thrive,” said Susan B. Parks, President and CEO of Orange County United Way. “We know we can’t do this alone, and UNITED4OC 2030 is an invitation to every resident, business, faith community and leader to get involved any way they can. Every moment of impact, no matter how big or small, helps shape a better Orange County.”

 The plan focuses on expanding access and opportunities for Orange County’s most vulnerable populations through United Way’s initiatives and key service

 United for Student Success offers holistic support to close opportunity gaps for underserved youth, focused on student readiness, on-time high school graduation, and college and career readiness. Its programs will empower more underserved students with adaptable skills to thrive in college and growing industries, navigate an ever-changing job market, secure living-wage jobs, and build successful careers regionally.

 United for Financial Security empowers families toward long-term economic stability through systemic financial wellness solutions along with advocacy and education. Its programs will help shape Orange County as a model of financial wellness, where families experience measurable gains in long-term financial stability through coordinated efforts with financial institutions, policymakers, businesses, and nonprofits.

 United to End Homelessness addresses the root causes of homelessness with prevention and housing, in order to strengthen housing and care systems and enhance prevention systems throughout the county. Its targeted and collaborative efforts bring the issue of homelessness to the forefront of the community’s collective discussion and create civic engagement that leads to meaningful and lasting results.

 211OC connects individuals and families to crucial services through an integrated and accountable social services network and real-time care coordination with closed-loop referrals for housing, food assistance and other resources offered by local nonprofits and government agencies. With trusted partnerships, technology, and data, 211OC reduces barriers and helps residents move toward a healthier, more stable future.
