# Maryland Casino Revenues Slip in August as Largest Operator Falters

Maryland’s casino industry posted weaker results in August, with statewide gaming revenue falling 2.1% from a year earlier. Total takings came in at $170.3 million, down from $173.9 million in August 2024, according to figures released by Maryland Lottery and Gaming.

 Revenue from video lottery terminals totaled $118.2 million, a slight dip from last year’s $118.5 million. Table games contributed $52 million, off from $55.4 million.

 Casino Performance * MGM National Harbor: $70.1 million (–6.5%)
* Live! Casino & Hotel: $63.2 million (+2.1%)
* Horseshoe Casino Baltimore: $15.1 million (+4.4%)
* Ocean Downs Casino: $10.3 million (+3.7%)
* Hollywood Casino Perryville: $6.7 million (–13.0%)
* Rocky Gap Casino Resort: $4.9 million (–1.1%)

 MGM National Harbor, the state’s top earner, reported a 6.5% revenue slide, weighing heavily on the statewide results. Hollywood Casino’s 13% decline was the steepest among the six properties. By contrast, Live! Casino & Hotel and Horseshoe Baltimore posted modest gains.

 “Maryland’s casino market continues to show mixed results, with some properties posting steady growth despite broader headwinds,” said Alex Murphy, a digital PR specialist at Casinos.com. “The performance gap between the state’s largest operator and mid-tier casinos will be important to watch moving forward.”

 Legal Uncertainty The revenue report comes as Maryland takes center stage in a closely watched legal fight over prediction markets. A federal judge recently ruled that contracts offered by Kalshi, a New York–based trading platform, could qualify as sports betting under state law. The company is appealing.

 “The Kalshi case highlights the blurred lines regulators are facing between traditional sports betting and emerging prediction markets,” Murphy said. “The outcome of this dispute could set an important precedent not just for Maryland, but for the broader U.S. gaming landscape.”
