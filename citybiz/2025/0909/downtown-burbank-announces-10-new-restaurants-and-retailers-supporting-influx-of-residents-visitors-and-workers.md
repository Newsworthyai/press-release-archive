# Downtown Burbank Announces 10 New Restaurants and Retailers, Supporting Influx of Residents, Visitors and Workers

Downtown Burbank has announced 10 new restaurants and retailers since the start of the year. This flurry of activity comes in response to the changing demographics that include an expanding number of residents and visitors in Downtown Burbank. The newly opened retailers and restaurants include Tigawok, Chubby Dumpling, Jam Jam Tea Studio, and Lab Lagree. These new offerings will soon be joined by Supreme Crab, The Melt, iSmash, High Intensity Pilates, Flow Wine and Coffee, and Fire Wings.

 “This activity reflects the proactive attraction efforts done by the City and the Downtown Burbank Property Based Business Improvement District (PBID) to create an environment that attracts both unique small business owners and well-established restaurant and fast-growing brands,” said City of Burbank Mayor, Nikki Perez.

 This latest influx of retailers and restaurants is in response to approximately 1,000 new housing units under construction, or newly opened in Downtown Burbank, as well as two new hotels that will add close to 300 rooms. This population and visitor increase is in addition to a significant city workforce population of 165,000.

 One of the standout locations driving new leasing activity is First Street Village, an ultra-modern 275-unit apartment community that opened earlier this year that features 12,000 square feet of ground floor retail space which is almost completely leased. First Street Village tenants now include Hardcore Fitness, Hollywood Pet Grooming Pet Store, High Intensity Pilates, and Flow Wine and Coffee — all set to serve the apartment residents and community.

 Flow, a new concept by Burbank residents Vincent Tempongko and Ariel Nicastro, is indicative of the entrepreneurial focus emphasized by the City. Set to open later this year, Flow will feature LaMill coffee, one of Los Angeles’ most exclusive roasters, as well as boutique, hard to find wines, creating a desirable destination for day and night.

 “We chose Burbank because its home. I grew up here, and Ariel has lived here for over a decade. This is our city, our home base, and we’re excited to be part of Burbank’s growth and future,” added Tempongko.

 To encourage restaurant attraction and expansion, the City and PBID have worked to ensure certainty of investment. Burbank’s Economic Development Team creates several programs to beautify Downtown and create a safe and thriving neighborhood. This collaborative relationship provides a high level of certainty for aspiring operators to try new ideas as well as established brands seeking expansion opportunities.

 Downtown events, such as arts and film festivals, have also encouraged more foot traffic, which in turn supports retailers and restaurants. Moreover, to ensure a safe and friendly downtown experience, the PBID’s Ambassador Program provides hospitality, maintenance and safety services for visitors and employees.

 “Downtown Burbank is fast becoming an 18-hour city. As more people call Downtown their home, we continue working to bring in the right mix of destination and community serving retail that will create a vibrant and exciting place to live, work and visit,” said Mayor Perez.
