# Oak Crest Residents Explore the World Together, One Trip at a Time

As many retirees have discovered, traveling is much easier–and more fun–when you live at Oak Crest, an Erickson Senior Living community in Parkville, Md. You can simply lock your door and go!

 No one knows that better than resident Anne Graham, who coordinates trips for her Oak Crest neighbors through the Senior Box Office, a program supported by the Baltimore County Department of Aging.

 Range of destinations “We have enjoyed European river boat cruises; overnight excursions across the U.S.; and daytrips to the Philadelphia Flower Show, museums, and to theaters like the Dutch Apple Dinner Theatre, American Music Theatre, and Sight and Sound in Lancaster, Pa.,” says Anne, who moved to Oak Crest five years ago from Towson, Md.

 This September, a group of residents will spend four days at the Edgewood Resort on the St. Lawrence River in New York as they visit the Castles of New York and the Thousand Islands. In October, residents will travel to Hamilton, N.J., to visit Grounds for Sculpture, a museum, sculpture garden, and arboretum.

 On average, anywhere from 25 to 40 retirees travel together. “I have been planning trips for Senior Box Office for almost 20 years,” says Anne. “And we always try to keep the trips affordable, with current prices ranging from $100 to $192 per person.”

 Go the extra mile For Oak Crest residents, group travel offers advantages such as reduced ticket costs, door-to-door service, and, of course, the companionship of fellow travelers.

 “Group travel eliminates the stress of traveling alone,” explains Tina Moskunas-Hamill, owner of Maryland-based Golden Travel Services, which specializes in creating unique, exclusive travel experiences tailored to older adults.

 Past Oak Crest trips have included a Mediterranean cruise, African safari, visits to Paris and Normandy in France, the Panama Canal, a Rhine River cruise, and Yellowstone National Park.   An easy trip “Every detail is planned and managed, there’s built-in community, and we prioritize accessibility, safety, and comfort,” Moskunas-Hamill explains. “We pick up residents directly from Oak Crest’s three clubhouses and return them home at the end, so there’s no stressing over driving or parking.”

 She continues, “Additionally, we offer a complimentary air concierge service, where residents are met curbside at the airport. Their luggage is handled, check-in and security are assisted, and the concierge flies round-trip with the group. It’s stress-free, seamless, and a favorite feature among travelers. Oak Crest residents know they’ll be looked after every step of the way.”

 Let’s go O’s For Oak Crest residents who prefer to explore sights closer to home, resident-run groups organize special trips to local museums, Baltimore Orioles games, and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra’s Pops Series at the Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall.

 Resident Polly Carroll, a lifelong Orioles fan, takes the lead in organizing trips to Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore.

 “We usually have between 15 and 25 people go to the games together,” says Polly. “I look at the schedule and try to choose games that feature fan promotions, like hat or shirt giveaways or something else fun. We also prefer evening games because they’re much cooler.”

 Team colors Clad in orange and black, attendees appreciate the convenience of being dropped off and picked up near the ballpark’s entrance.

 “Being at the ballpark is fun! I usually pack a sandwich and prepare some small bags of peanuts to hand out to everyone in our group. It’s great that we can all enjoy the game together. It’s always a good time,” says Polly.

 Less stress Even those who prefer to plan their own trips and travel solo benefit from living at Oak Crest.

 Once a resident is packed and ready to go, all they have to do is let security know that they’re headed out the door. The best part? Worries like potential leaks and damage from heavy storms are in the past. Staff members keep a close eye on residents’ maintenance-free homes, and neighbors offer to water plants and watch over pets.

 Convenient location Plus, the community’s convenient location makes getting to the Port of Baltimore and the Baltimore/Washington International Airport easy!

 “You don’t have to worry about your mail while you’re gone. When you get back from your trip, you have lots of dinner companions to share stories and pictures with,” says Anne. “And your monthly expenses at Oak Crest are consistent! There are no surprises, like the need for a new water heater, so you can spend more money on travel.”
