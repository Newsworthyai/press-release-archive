# Stanley Cup Brought to Eagles’ Haven Wellness Center by Coach Robb Tallas

Tallas Shares Special Day with Stoneman Douglas Survivors and Victims’ Families

 The Stanley Cup made a memorable stop at Eagles’ Haven Wellness Center during Florida Panthers Goaltending Coach Robb Tallas’ day with the Cup, bringing joy and inspiration to survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School tragedy and families of the victims.

 The visit was part of Tallas’ day spent with one of sport’s most iconic trophies, following the Panthers’ historic 2025 Stanley Cup Championship win.

 Founded in the aftermath of the 2018 tragedy, Eagles’ Haven Wellness Center provides crisis support, navigation services, wellness programs and support groups. This marked the second time Tallas chose to share his day with the Cup with the Stoneman Douglas community. After the Panthers’ 2024 championship, he brought the trophy to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, giving students and faculty a special moment to share in the Panthers’ celebration. With strong ties to Coral Springs and Parkland, Tallas also founded the Robb Tallas Goalie Development School, which conducts camps at the Panthers IceDen in Coral Springs.

 “This is a day our community will never forget,” said Rebecca Jarquin, Director of Eagles’ Haven Wellness Center. “Coach Tallas’ decision to bring the Stanley Cup here speaks volumes about his heart and his connection to the community. It means so much to the survivors, families and the entire Parkland and Coral Springs community.”
