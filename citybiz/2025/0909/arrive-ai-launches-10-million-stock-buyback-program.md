# Arrive AI Launches $10 Million Stock Buyback Program

Arrive AI (Nasdaq:ARAI) today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $10 million of the Company’s common stock from now through March 31, 2026.

 The authorization reflects the Board’s view that the current share price represents an attractive investment relative to Arrive AI’s long-term opportunities. Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions, or under Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, in each case in accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and subject to market conditions and other factors, including customary blackout periods. The program may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time at the Company’s discretion. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased, if any, will depend on a variety of factors, including price, liquidity, and alternative uses of capital.

 Dan O’Toole, Founder and CEO of Arrive AI, said: “We believe ARAI is materially undervalued given our momentum and the scale of the opportunity in autonomous, secure delivery. This authorization gives us the flexibility to be opportunistic when conditions are favorable, while we continue executing and building long-term shareholder value at the last inch of the last-mile.”
