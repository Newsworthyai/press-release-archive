# Governor Moore and County Executive Braveboy Highlight South Lake as Regional Economic Engine

Maryland Governor Wes Moore and Prince George’s County Executive Aisha Braveboy visited the South Lake development in Bowie on September 4, highlighting its $1.3 billion investment and its role in generating housing, retail, and long-term economic growth for the region.

 Speaking to about 100 business, community, and elected leaders at an event hosted by Gary Michael, President of NAI Michael, the project’s developer, the Governor and County Executive highlighted the economic benefits South Lake is bringing to the state and county. Michael thanked the state and local officials for their support and shared updates on retail leasing and residential sales, noting that home sales are expected to wrap up within the next year.

 “I love this project, not just because we’re talking new jobs, not just because we’re talking $1.3 billion in economic investments and economic growth that will not just impact this area, but an entire corridor of development that will have ripple effects all over the state of Maryland and beyond,” Governor Moore said.

 “Everything we need to not just survive, but to thrive, is going to be built here,” the Governor added. “This is going to be a model for how our state moves and for how our state thrives.”

 

 “I love South Lake because it represents dreams realized,” County Executive Braveboy said. “When you take a long-time developer who has contributed so much to the fabric of Prince George’s County and combine that with the ingenuity, the entrepreneurship, the drive and dedication of those members of our community who want to see their vision come to life you see how NAI Michael helped make their dreams become reality and for that I say ‘thank you.’

 “This causes people to have hope, it causes people to want to do more,” she said. “To not just be consumers, but to be producers and to know they have a place to make money in Prince George’s County and not just spend it. That’s huge to us because we have to grow our economy and the way we do that is with our small businesses.”

 During the event, Michael announced several project updates, including the pending completion of Phase I retail leasing with a range of national and local businesses that reflect Prince George’s County.

 Giant Food & Pharmacy opened in March, and Sheetz opened in July 2024. McDonald’s opened in July 2025. Several other national tenants are preparing to open, including Chase Bank, Jersey Mike’s Subs, and Tropical Smoothie Café. South Lake will also feature local and minority-owned businesses, among them Lance London’s Ma Pearl’s Louisiana-inspired restaurant, Mi Lindo Cancun Grill by the Annapolis Salmoran family, 4th Quarter Sports Bar owned by former NBA player Quinn Cook, Ledo Pizza, Dat Jerk Caribbean Chargrill, AjaBLU Salon & Studio, and Pack ‘N Business Solutions LLC.

 Michael said residential demand remains strong, with multiple home categories sold out and luxury apartments now leasing. The community connects to Liberty Sports Park, which welcomed more than 344,000 visitors in its first year. Together, South Lake residents and sports tourism create a steady base of customers for retailers and restaurants.
