# State Roundup: Maryland Pushes Back: Moore, Scott Announce ‘Renewed’ Collaboration Between State, City Police; State Officials Say Trump Trying To Undermine Elections; Moore Says Covid Vaccines Will Be Available

MOORE, SCOTT RENEW CRIME FIGHTING COLLABORATION IN B’MORE: With President Donald Trump’s threat to send National Guard troops into Baltimore in the air, Maryland leaders said Friday that they will pour more of their own resources to further bring down crime in the state’s largest city. Dana Munro and Erin Cox/The Washington Post.

 * Neither Moore nor Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D) mentioned Trump by name Friday as they announced plans for a “renewed collaboration” between the Baltimore City Police Department and the Maryland State Police. But many of their remarks responded to charges by Trump, who recently called Baltimore a crime “hellhole.” Danielle Brown/Maryland Matters.
* Two weeks after practically daring the president to come walk through Baltimore with him, Moore set out Friday from the middle of Park Heights to do the thing Donald Trump has said he won’t: Take a stroll through the city. Lee O. Sanderlin and Pamela Wood/The Baltimore Banner.

 COLUMN: WE KNOW TRUMP’s THREAT IS NOT ABOUT CRIME: No one is arguing Baltimore doesn’t have a crime problem. As my colleague Lee Sanderlin reported recently, seven people were killed last month in the city — bringing the total number of homicides this year to 91. Donald Trump’s threat to send in the National Guard to Baltimore is not about crime; it’s not even about Baltimore or Chicago or any other of his favorite municipal punching bags, all run by Democratic mayors who happen to be people of color. It is about power. Rick Hutzell/The Baltimore Banner.

 MARYLAND PUSHES BACK AS TRUMP ATTEMPTS TO INTERVENE ON ELECTIONS: Maryland elections officials have spent years batting down false claims of voter fraud and bolstering the state’s mail-in voting process. Now, as President Donald Trump once again tries to intervene in how states run elections, they’re pushing back — saying his latest efforts will undermine confidence in the process, while Maryland Republicans say the moves will help assure voters. Sam Janesch/The Baltimore Sun.

 FEDERAL COST SHIFTS FORCE STATES TO SCRAMBLE TO COVER LOSSES: States are scrambling to prepare for an unprecedented shift of costs and responsibilities under President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax and spending plan, which will force them to make difficult decisions about cuts to state programs to offset the new financial burdens. “There’s not a single state that has the resources to make up for this. You cannot backfill it,” says Gov. Wes Moore. “The federal government is now literally saying to the states, ‘You are now on your own.’” Yasmeen Abutaleb and Maeve Reston/The Washington Post.

 MOORE SAYS COVID VACCINE WILL BE AVAILABLE: Gov. Wes Moore sought to reassure Marylanders who want an updated Covid vaccine this fall that they will be able to get one in the state. “The federal government’s rapid changes and unnecessary swirl around vaccine policy is harmful for Marylanders and all Americans, and could result in disastrous public health outcomes,” Moore said in a statement Friday evening. Meredith Cohn/The Baltimore Banner.

 GUN ROSTER BOARD APPEARS TO BE A RUBBERSTAMP: Since 2018, the Maryland Handgun Roster board has approved thousands of petitions, allowing new handguns or handgun models to be sold in the state as long as they functioned, a Baltimore Sun data analysis found. Between 2018 and 2024, unless a gun did not fire — or a petitioner incorrectly filed their petition — the board passed it through. Kate Cimini/The Baltimore Sun.

 STATE DROPS ATTEMPT TO GET HOSPITALS TO REPAY THOSE WRONGLY CHARGED: Three years ago, state officials tried to right a historical wrong by forcing Maryland hospitals to return at least $120 million they owed to thousands of low-income patients. It would have been a groundbreaking move benefiting vulnerable patients who had qualified for free care but were charged anyway. Without saying a word publicly, officials this year pulled the plug on the refund initiative. Meredith Cohn/The Baltimore Banner.

 DOT RELEASES BLUEPRINT TO EXPAND TRAIL SYSTEM: The Maryland Department of Transportation has released a new blueprint to expand and connect the state’s transportation trail system with an emphasis on safety, accessibility and community development. Todd Karpovich/The Baltimore Sun.

 SEAFOOD: THE MARYLAND INDUSTRY THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM TARIFFS: The one import that has seemed beyond the reach of President Donald Trump’s trade war is harming the Maryland seafood industry. As executive vice president of the Chesapeake Bay Seafood Industries Association, Bill Sieling’s been asking the White House for tariffs on foreign crabmeat since the late 1990s. Tim Prudente/The Baltimore Banner.

 MARYLAND’s 1st DISTRICT A SMALL BARGAINING CHIP IN FIGHT FOR U.S. HOUSE: Maryland’s 1st Congressional District could become a small bargaining chip in the nationwide battle over redistricting. States across the country are joining the political back-and-forth of redistricting after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill to redraw the state’s map ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, an effort to likely net Republicans five added seats in the House of Representatives. Konner Metz/The Cecil Whig.

 RASKIN JOINS DEFENSE OF BALTIMORE: Baltimore has one more defender — U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin, who stood up for the city against House Republicans during a war of words on social media Friday that spilled into the weekend. The Maryland Democrat was critical of the House Judiciary GOP, which referenced the HBO television series “The Wire,” which ended in 2008, to take a swipe at Baltimore’s crime rate while praising President Donald Trump’s efforts to curb muggings and murders in Washington, D.C. Mary Carole McCauley/The Baltimore Sun.

 TRUMP ‘BABY BONUS’ VS. BALTIMORE’s: After a $1,000 Baltimore Baby Bonus effort failed last year, President Donald Trump launched a separate program at the national level, giving every family with a new baby $1,000 to invest in the stock market, only touchable after the child turns 18. Brooke Conrad/The Baltimore Sun.

 PATOKA TO LAUNCH BA CO EXEC CAMPAIGN TODAY: Baltimore County Councilman Izzy Patoka, a Pikesville resident and second-term Democrat, is launching his campaign for Baltimore County executive today. Patoka, first elected to the council in 2018, said he initially sought public office after doing “community-centered work” in local and state governments. His reasoning for running for county executive is similar. Natalie Jones/The Baltimore Sun.

 CARROLL STATE’S ATTY: 253 DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS GET JUSTICE SINCE JAN. 1: Carroll County State’s Attorney Haven Shoemaker says the county’s domestic violence prosecutor, Craig Wolf, has sought justice for 253 victims in Carroll County since the start of 2025. He said that number highlights the need to continue funding a special prosecutor in the state’s attorney’s office who is focused on domestic abuse survivors. Gabriella Fine/The Carroll County Times.

 PAUSE IN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN COULD HARM MANY CHARITIES: Like officials at a number of charities around the state, Mary Helfrich of St. Vincent de Paul in Baltimore says a pause in the Combined Federal Campaign won’t be catastrophic for her organization. But it’s not good news either, and she said it could be particularly hard on smaller charities. Nicole Pilsbury/Maryland Matters.

 STATE SUPREMES HEARS DETAILS ON ARCHDIOCESE SEX ABUSE: The Maryland Supreme Court on Friday heard about 2 1/2 hours of legal arguments over whether the names of more than a dozen people contained in a report that details decades of allegations of sexual abuse and cover-ups within the Archdiocese of Baltimore can be made public. Until now, the litigation has largely played out under seal. It’s unclear when the justices will issue their decision. Dylan Segelbaum/The Baltimore Banner.
