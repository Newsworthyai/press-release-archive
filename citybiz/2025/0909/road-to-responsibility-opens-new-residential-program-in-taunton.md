# Road to Responsibility Opens New Residential Program in Taunton

Road to Responsibility (RTR), one of the region’s largest and most successful nonprofit organizations supporting individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, announces the opening of its new residential program, located on Range Avenue in Taunton, Massachusetts.

 The newly constructed single-story residence was developed by long-time Road to Responsibility partner Patriot Investment Corp. of South Easton and is currently leased to RTR by the firm.

 The residence will house several current RTR members with intellectual and developmental disabilities and autism who have aged out of the educational system, while also creating opportunities for others on the waiting list for similar services through the Department of Developmental Services (DDS).

 Like other RTR residential programs, the Taunton home offers a supportive environment with a wide range of services, 24-hour staffing, and independent living options including smart technology.

 “The opening of our Taunton residence marks another important step in expanding our reach across the region,” said Christopher T. White, Ed.D., president and CEO of Road to Responsibility. “As demand continues to grow, we remain committed to developing high-quality supportive homes that empower individuals to live more independently and with dignity. We’re grateful for our continued partnership with Patriot Investment Corp. which helps make these vital expansions possible.”
