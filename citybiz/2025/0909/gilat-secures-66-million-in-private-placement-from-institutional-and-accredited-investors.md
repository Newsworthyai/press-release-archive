# Gilat Secures $66 Million in Private Placement from Institutional and Accredited Investors

Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd. (NASDAQ: GILT, TASE: GILT), a worldwide leader in satellite networking technology, solutions and services, announced today that, following the approval of its Board of Directors, it has received and accepted commitments from Israeli institutional and accredited investors (as defined under Israel’s Securities Law, 5728-1968) (the “Investors”), to participate in a private placement (the “Private Placement”) of Ordinary Shares of the Company (“Ordinary Shares”).

 The Company is expected to issue and sell to the Investors an aggregate of 7,058,820 Ordinary Shares (the “Shares”), for a purchase price of US$9.35 per Share, which represents a 6.3% discount over the 7-day Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP). The newly issued Shares are expected to represent approximately 11% of the Company’s issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares after the consummation of such sale. The closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed in September 2025.

 The Company expects to receive net proceeds from the sale of the Shares, after deducting offering expenses, of approximately US$65.0 million. The Company intends to use such proceeds for general corporate purposes.

 The Private Placement is being made in Israel only and not to U.S. persons, as defined in Rule 902 of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), pursuant to a registration exemption afforded by Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act, and the Shares will be subject to certain transfer restrictions. The Shares will not be registered under the Securities Act and will not be offered or sold in the United States without registration or applicable exemption from the registration requirements according to the Securities Act.

 This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy or subscribe for any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, sale, issuance or transfer would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.
