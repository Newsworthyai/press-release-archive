# New Amenities at Brinton Clubhouse Bring Residents Together at Maris Grove

By Julia Collins

 Maris Grove, an Erickson Senior Living community in the Brandywine Valley of Pennsylvania, has continuously evolved to support residents’ active lifestyle–and nowhere is that more evident than in the recent renovation of Brinton Clubhouse.

 The renovation included design updates as well as upgrades to the clubhouse’s amenities. As Executive Director Chad Couture explains, “We’ve added more fitness space, more programs, and more intimate restaurant spaces to dine in–all based on what residents tell us they value the most.”   Resident input The multiphase project began in 2023 with input from resident committees and staff members.

 “We presented the drawings and textile selections our design team had chosen and asked our Resident Advisory Council and its dining advisory committee to give us their feedback and ideas,” says Couture. When construction wrapped up at the end of 2024, the result was a space that’s not only beautiful but functional and full of energy.

 Fitness and friendship Resident Marty Saporosa, who moved to Maris Grove four years ago, is very impressed with the renovation, especially the upgraded fitness center.

 “It’s unbelievable! The fitness center is maybe two or three times bigger than the last center. It’s got all new equipment,” says Marty, who exercises three days a week in the new fitness center. He enjoys lifting weights and working with a personal trainer.

 He adds, “Everything is just perfect. It’s getting busier by the day, and the camaraderie in the fitness center is just amazing.”

 In fact, Couture notes that the goal of fostering camaraderie was central to the redesign. “The new fitness studio on the second floor allows for more group fitness classes to be offered,” he explains, adding that residents provided feedback on the layout and equipment for that space as well.

 Dining redefined Dining was another focus of the clubhouse’s transformation. A brand-new dining venue, Markham’s, was introduced as a “no reservation” option.

 “It features smaller plates and multiple courses. It meets the request we had from some who wanted smaller portions,” Couture explains. “Markham’s also offers bar seating, which has been particularly popular, as it encourages diners to meet others and socialize.” Marty is a fan. “The food at Markham’s is just to die for, and I like that you don’t have to make a reservation,” he says.

 Every Tuesday, Marty, his wife Nancy, and four other neighbors gather for dinner. They recently dined at Millstone, which was also redesigned.

 Spaces to gather Several common areas in the clubhouse were reimagined as well, creating fun new spaces for residents to gather for pre-dinner cocktails and late-night card games.

 “The newly added Longwood Lounge on the second floor offers a space to socialize before dinner. There’s a wet bar and space to store your personal wine or liquor,” says Couture.

 “And right outside the Markham’s bar, there’s a waiting area with a TV,” notes Marty. “Across the hallway, there is a seating area where people can put puzzles together. Usually, there’s one or two people who will play the piano at night. That’s very soothing.”

 Upstairs, residents are loving the new terrace, which overlooks the community’s beautifully landscaped grounds and features two billiards tables.

 Designed for everyone But the renovation wasn’t just about amenities–it was about enhancing experiences for both residents and staff members.

 “We redesigned the front desk for our communications team, we enhanced the space for our security dispatch team, and we completed an impressive renovation of the medical center,” Couture notes. “Employee engagement is very important to us. We did everything we could to listen to their requests and make changes with them in mind as well.”

 Residents have responded enthusiastically. “They love it!” Couture shares. “We’ve really enjoyed hearing that they love how it turned out. They are making the most of the new spaces, gathering with neighbors and making new friends through different activities.”

 A vibrant lifestyle Brinton Clubhouse’s transformation represents more than a renovation–it’s a reaffirmation of Maris Grove’s commitment to providing a vibrant lifestyle for today’s retirees.

 “We help people live better lives,” Couture says. “Change at Maris Grove is constant, as we are always looking for ways to improve–today’s new innovation is tomorrow’s expectation.”
