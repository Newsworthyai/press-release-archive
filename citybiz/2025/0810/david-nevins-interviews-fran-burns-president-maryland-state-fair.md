# David Nevins Interviews Fran Burns, President, Maryland State Fair

Fran Burns is a retired sales professional and passionate advocate for agriculture and Thoroughbred aftercare based in Maryland. She is a graduate of Garrison Forest School and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Fran spent 20 successful years in radio advertising sales with WFBR, WLIF, and WIYY, earning the Hearst Eagle Award during her tenure at WIYY. She later transitioned into dental sales with Dentsply, where she built a respected second career and was honored as a member of the President’s Club, recognizing her outstanding performance and leadership.

 Deeply committed to Maryland’s agricultural heritage, Fran currently serves as President of the Board of Directors of the Maryland State Fair and Agricultural Society, Inc., continuing a proud family tradition—her great-grandfather also held the same position. Her leadership reflects a lifelong passion for agriculture and a dedication to promoting education, community involvement, and the future of farming across the state.

 A tireless advocate for equine welfare, Fran is a long-time volunteer with MidAtlantic Horse Rescue, a Maryland-based nonprofit dedicated to rescue and aftercare for off-track thoroughbreds. Her unwavering commitment to thoroughbreds was recognized in 2022 with the Joe Kelly Unsung Hero Award, which honors individuals who selflessly support Thoroughbred racing and aftercare behind the scenes.

 Fran is also the Head Tour Guide for Sunrise at Old Hilltop Tours at Pimlico Race Track in Baltimore. She redesigned the tours 15 years ago to give the public a “behind the scenes” tour of Maryland horse racing and Historic Pimlico Race Track. With a staff of 14 tour guides, the tours enjoyed their largest attendance this past year, the 150th Preakness, with over 2500 guests. Tours ran Tuesday through Friday of Preakness Week from 6am until 9am and were free.

 Fran owns and runs a small boarding operation at her farm, Boxwood Farm, in Monkton, Md.
