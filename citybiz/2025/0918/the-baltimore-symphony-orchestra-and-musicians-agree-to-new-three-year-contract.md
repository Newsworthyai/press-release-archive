# The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and Musicians Agree to New Three-Year Contract

The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra (BSO) and its musicians, represented by the Musicians’ Association of Metropolitan Baltimore, Local 40-543 American Federation of Musicians, have reached a new three-year collective bargaining agreement (CBA), marking the most financially ambitious contract in more than a decade. This multi-year agreement increases minimum musician pay by 12 percent over three years, reaching $101,350 by the 2027-28 season.

 “This agreement reflects our deep appreciation for the artistry and dedication of our incredible musicians,” said Mark Hanson, president and CEO of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. “Just as we are honored to recognize their value with meaningful pay increases, we are deeply grateful to our musician colleagues for embracing important CBA changes that position us to expand audiences and strengthen revenue. Together, we can ensure the BSO remains a cultural cornerstone for generations to come.”

 Agreement was reached following months of open and positive dialogue, where increases in musician pay were a mutual goal for both parties from the beginning, demonstrating a shared vision for growth and innovation.

 “The musicians of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra have a deep and abiding commitment to our devoted audiences, not only in Baltimore, but across our entire state of Maryland,” said Jeremy Buckler, chair of the Players’ Committee. “This new contract empowers us to build on our legacy of world-class artistry, community, and economic impact, while enabling us to attract and retain the next generation of musicians. We look forward to moving ahead with the management and Board in this new era to create even broader access to the benefits of symphonic music for current and future generations.”

 The agreement also incorporates revised audition and tenure review processes that have the potential to become a new standard in the industry. Together, both parties redesigned the language from the ground up to develop a process that guarantees every candidate an equal opportunity to be selected.

 “From the outset, these negotiations were guided by respect, transparency, and an unwavering commitment to our shared aspirations,” said Board Chair Barry Rosen. “I want to extend my sincere appreciation to the elected members of the Orchestra’s negotiation committee and to all 85 members of the Orchestra, and to both our dedicated management team and the Board of Directors of the BSO for their unwavering support. And of course, none of this is possible without the incredible generosity of our donors and community partners.”

 The terms of the ratified agreement, effective from September 15, 2025, to September 10, 2028, include the following:

 * Steady annual increases in musician pay, totaling 12% over three years, with minimum annual salary growing from $92,811 in year one (FY2026) to $101,350 by year three (FY2028):
