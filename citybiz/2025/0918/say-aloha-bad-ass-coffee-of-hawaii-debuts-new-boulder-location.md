# Say Aloha! Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii Debuts New Boulder Location

Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii, a renowned coffee franchise recognized for its premium Hawaiian coffees, strong community connections, and adventurous spirit, will open its newest location on Thursday, Sept. 18. Located at 2850 Baseline Rd., the new location will offer handcrafted coffees with a kick, branded merchandise, and a craveable food menu with a Hawaiian twist. There will also be a festive Grand Opening Celebration with FREE giveaways and live Hawaiian entertainment, including music, hula, and burros, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 20.

 Bad Ass Coffee in Boulder is owned and operated by local entrepreneur Beth Deasy, with longtime teammates Andi Nakata (Chief Operating Officer) and Stephanie Hooper (Chief Experience Officer). Deasy is an experienced entrepreneur and multi-unit franchisee. The trio has previous experience working together at Deasy’s Denver-area gymnastics and cheer center and multiple Primrose Schools. Now, they are pouring their experience and heart into a welcoming Bad Ass Coffee shop with two patios, including a cozy upstairs outdoor fireplace, and a team of 24 local baristas – many Colorado University students. Steps from the dorms and campus, it is an ideal spot to study, meet up, host an event at the community table, and grab a daily dose of warm aloha. This badass Boulder team brings a proven, people-first culture to the new location that is set to make waves in the community.

 “We’re bringing the warm aloha spirit to Boulder! Craft coffee, friendly faces, and a welcoming spot between campus and the dorms where study sessions and hangouts for coffee lovers of all ages can share in our ‘ohana,” said Deasy. “This newest Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii cafe is about more than coffee it’s about creating a relaxing space for the Boulder community.”

 In addition to premium Hawaiian coffees, Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii serves up a full menu of popular blended drinks, signature lattes, cold brews, teas and innovative foods with a Hawaiian twist. Guests can enjoy an island-inspired experience with nods to Bad Ass Coffee’s Hawaiian roots, savoring signature offerings in a comfortable space. Those looking to take the taste of Hawaii home can purchase packages of Hawaiian blends and single-origin coffee beans including 100% Kona, single serve pods and flavored coffee, along with a variety of playful branded merchandise.

 “As a Colorado-based franchise company, I have always loved and appreciated the way that Boulder “shows up” as a community for each other,” said Scott Snyder, CEO, Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii. “With our origins from Hawaii, we too share that same commitment to ‘Ohana (family) and investment as an integral part of the community. That’s exactly the kind of energy we build into our cafés and with Beth, Andi, and Stephanie leading the way, I know this shop will feel like a true neighborhood spot where aloha is more than a word—it’s how you’re treated.”

 Guests are invited to join ‘Ohana Rewards, Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii’s loyalty program. New ‘Ohana Rewards members will receive $5 off and 89 Lei (points) after their first purchase as a member.

 Born on the Big Island of Hawaii in 1989, Bad Ass Coffee was founded on the dream of sharing American-grown, premium Hawaiian coffee with people everywhere. The brand invites guests to embrace their adventurous spirit, with its coffee beans sourced from the famous Kona region of the Big Island, Kauai and Maui. Its name pays tribute to Hawaiian coffee history – donkeys could often be heard bellowing as they carried precious loads of coffee beans down the steep mountains of the Big Island. The people of Kona named these hard-working donkeys the “Bad Ass Ones” because of their reliably strong, but stubborn nature in carrying their cargo.

 The legend of those stubborn donkeys lives on today at Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii, a company that is uncompromising when it comes to sourcing, roasting, and serving quality Hawaiian coffee with the Aloha spirit.

 Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii – Boulder will be open Monday – Sunday from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. For more information on Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii in Boulder, please visit Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii Boulder or call 720.821.3998. Mobile and delivery options coming soon!

 Deasy also plans to expand Bad Ass Coffee to Lakewood’s Belmar shopping center, with opening planned for the winter holiday season. With rapid expansion underway, the Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii brand has set aggressive expansion plans to open a multitude of new locations over the next five years, with territories available nationwide.
