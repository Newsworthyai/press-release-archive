“We are pleased with the results of the marketing and sale process as we reached value-maximizing transaction agreements that will allow certain areas of our business to continue operating under new ownership,” said Sue Buchta, Chief Executive Officer. “These agreements demonstrate the importance of our various business segments and create an opportunity for these brands to thrive going forward. I am deeply grateful for the support of our employees and partners throughout this process.”

 “Following a comprehensive, court-supervised marketing and sale process, we have determined that this outcome represents the best path forward to maximize value for DGA’s assets and minimize disruption for the Company’s valued customers and partners,” said Brett Anderson, Chief Strategy Officer. “The Court’s approval of these transactions affirms months of careful planning and constructive engagement with interested parties and sets the stage for a smooth transition.”

 The Company will work with the buyers to transition ownership of the businesses and/or related assets in connection with the closing of the Transactions, all of which are expected to occur by year end, subject to customary closing conditions. DGA remains focused on serving its customers during these transitions.
