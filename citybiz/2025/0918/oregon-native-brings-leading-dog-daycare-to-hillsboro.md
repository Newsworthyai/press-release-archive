# Oregon Native Brings Leading Dog Daycare to Hillsboro

Dogtopia, the nation’s leading dog wellness franchise, is opening a new location in Hillsboro on September 29th. Located at 7478 E. Main St, Dogtopia of Hillsboro will provide award-winning dog daycare, boarding and spa services to dog parents in the community. Beginning on September 29th and continuing through the weekend, Dogtopia of Hillsboro will host a grand opening for all dogs and pet owners to enjoy. Dogtopia of Hillsboro is offering a special offer of unlimited weekly daycare at just $79 per week for an entire year. On top of that, every enrolled pup receives a free DASH activity monitor at their Meet & Greet and a complimentary full-service bath during the first month of operation. This limited-time offer is available while spots remain.

 Providing personalized care for Hillsboro pups in a fun, enriching, and safe environment, Dogtopia sets the industry standard among daycares with a focus on socialization, exercise, and education. Dogtopia allows dogs to enjoy plenty of exercise, play with like-minded dogs, and learn important social skills, all under the supervision of professionally trained Canine Coaches. All dogs undergo a careful evaluation to ensure they’re ready for the high-energy, social play environment, including a thorough head-to-tail health check before entering and heading home. Strict vaccine and spay/neuter policies are enforced to keep everyone safe. Each of the indoor and climate-controlled playrooms includes dogs of similar size and play style and is built with compressed rubber flooring to reduce the impact on dogs’ paws and joints.

 Dogtopia of Hillsboro is owned by Jeremy Shidner, a serial entrepreneur, who previously owned and operated several fitness centers in and around Portland. After feeling burned out from the fitness industry, he decided it was time to pursue something new but still centered around health and wellness. Inspired by his own dog, Jeremy recognized the opportunity to combine his business expertise with a love for four-legged friends which ultimately led him to Dogtopia. The Hillsboro location is the first of five Dogtopias that Jeremy plans to open in the greater Portland metro area, bringing safe, high-quality dog daycare to pet parents across the region.

 “After years in the fitness industry, I was ready for a new challenge that still allowed me to make a positive impact every day,” said Shidner, “Dogtopia stood out because of the strong sense of community. Everyone shares a love for dogs, and it’s rewarding to build something local that pet parents can trust and pups can thrive in.”

 The 6,000-square-foot facility is expected to create 30 jobs, with the added perk of allowing team members to bring their dogs to work with them at no cost.

 Dogtopia also runs the Dogtopia Foundation, a nonprofit with the mission to enable dogs to positively change our world. The Foundation funds programs focused on three worthy causes: service dogs for veterans, therapy dogs for students, and employment initiatives for adults with autism. One hundred percent of funds raised are donated directly to the supported organizations. To learn more, visit www.dogtopiafoundation.org.

 Dogtopia of Hillsboro is open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. For more information on Dogtopia of Hillsboro, call (971) 332 8787 or visit https://www.dogtopia.com/portland-oregon-hillsboro/
