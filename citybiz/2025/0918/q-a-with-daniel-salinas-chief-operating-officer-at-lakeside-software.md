# Q&amp;A with Daniel Salinas, Chief Operating Officer at Lakeside Software

Daniel Salinas returns to Lakeside Software as Chief Operating Officer, steering global Sales, Customer Success, Customer Support, and Business Development. With over 25 years of enterprise IT leadership—from his early roots at IBM to today’s AI-driven tech landscape—Dan brings a strategic mix of deep technical insight and business execution. Dan began his career at IBM, dedicating 18+ years to technical, sales, and management roles, where he directed global sales initiatives around smart business desktop cloud solutions. He holds a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering from the University of Michigan, along with an MBA from the Ross School of Business.

 In 2010, Dan joined Lakeside Software as Vice President of Business Development, working directly with CEO Mike Schumacher and helping to position the company as a leader in digital experience and desktop analytics. After expanding his impact as Chief Revenue Officer at Relay Network and later at Nobl9, he is excited to return to Lakeside and lead the next phase of growth fueled by AI and edge observability.

 Lakeside has been a continual leader in digital employee experience. How are you evolving to meet the needs of today’s hybrid, fast-paced workplace?

 Lakeside has always been at the center of digital employee experience, and as the workplace becomes more hybrid and fast-paced, the role of the EUC administrator is evolving too. What used to be a reactive support function is now moving closer to the world of site reliability engineering, where success is measured by predictability, automation, and resilience. Our focus is on giving EUC teams the same kind of data depth, actionable insights, and trustworthy automation that SREs rely on so they can get ahead of issues instead of chasing tickets, and deliver the kind of seamless, reliable digital experiences employees expect in today’s workplace.

 What role does the COO play in helping a high-growth SaaS company scale effectively while staying close to the customer?

 That’s a great question. I think the COO’s role in a high-growth SaaS company is really about building the muscle to scale without losing sight of why customers bought into you in the first place. That means putting in place the right processes, systems, and talent so the business can grow efficiently, but also making sure those guardrails don’t distance us from the customer. At Lakeside, I see my job as connecting the dots between the operational engine and the voice of the customer, so we can execute at scale while still listening closely, adapting quickly, and elevating the customer’s outcomes at the center of every decision.

 IT is often seen as a behind-the-scenes function, but Lakeside flips that narrative. How are you helping IT become the hero of the business?

 I cut my teeth running desktop support at IBM. IT has always been the quiet backbone of the business, but in today’s digital workplace, every employee experience is an IT experience. Lakeside helps flip that narrative by giving IT the visibility and intelligence to not just react to problems, but to prevent them, optimize them, and deliver seamless digital experiences at scale. Just as importantly, we help IT visualize and explain the value of those decisions in terms the business understands — showing the impact on productivity, cost, and outcomes so they can secure the budget and support they need to be successful. That combination turns IT from a behind-the-scenes function into a true hero of the business.

 Can you share a moment or story where Lakeside helped an organization turn IT insights into a major business outcome?

 A major bank had a planned refresh of 7,000 laptops. Pretty standard, right? Well, it’s also pretty costly—so before they wrote a big check, they decided to look at the data from Lakeside’s endpoint sensors. That was a real eye-opening moment. Because based on their real-world usage data, they learned that only 600 out of the 7,000 laptops actually needed replacing. That’s less than 10%! So instead of a mandatory refresh, they just updated the 600 that needed it, and they ended up saving around $9 million that they could use on other projects.

 How is Lakeside using AI and automation to reduce tech friction for end users and increase productivity across the enterprise?

 The best solutions are what we call “invisible IT” because they work seamlessly in the background while employees do their jobs. We worked with one organization that used sensors and automation to prevent more than 205,000 help desk tickets every month by monitoring all of their device data, scanning for anomalies and other potential issues, and automatically deploying fixes. The IT might be “invisible” to the average employee, but the results are pretty obvious in terms of increased productivity and cost savings. Importantly, those are measurable outcomes that help justify IT budgets.

 What leadership lessons have shaped your approach to driving cross-functional alignment and resilience in a rapidly evolving tech environment?

 My [niece] ran track and field in high school, including the hurdles. To finish a race, you had to jump over these obstacles—you couldn’t go around them. It’s a great metaphor because when you’re trying to get people to work together or get through tough times, you’re always going to have some hurdles in your way. Maybe your budget is too small, or you’re dealing with a culture that’s built around silos… whatever the issue is, it’s your job as a leader to coach people over those hurdles. Some employees may need new skills, while others may just need someone cheering them on. I think that’s a great leadership lesson, and it’s something I keep in mind with every new challenge.
