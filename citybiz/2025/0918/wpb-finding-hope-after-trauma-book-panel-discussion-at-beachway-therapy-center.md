# WPB: Finding Hope After Trauma: Book Panel Discussion at Beachway Therapy Center

Beachway Therapy Center, located in downtown West Palm Beach, is hosting a powerful and uplifting panel discussion on Rescued: Hope for the Shattered Heart and Soul, a book by Tricia Youngs, LMHC. The event will be held on the Beachway campus on Friday, Oct. 24, from 11:30 a.m. – 2:00 p.m. The event is complimentary, but registration is required and can be made here. The event is open to the public but space is limited.

 Youngs’ book is more than a memoir, it’s a roadmap for healing. “This book is a guide for anyone ready to break free from the chains of trauma, betrayal, and emotional chaos,” says Youngs.

 Drawing from her own experiences with sexual abuse, addiction, narcissistic abuse, and profound loss, as well as over 26 years as a therapist and trauma recovery coach, she shows how even the deepest pain can be transformed into strength, resilience, and hope.

 The event will feature:

 * Author & Panelist: Tricia Youngs, LMHC
* Moderator: Eric Bricker, LMHC
* Panelists: Jill Bershad, Tim Roberto, Craig Robinson, and Kim Litton

 Together, they will share personal accounts of recovery, explore best practices in trauma treatment, and discuss the pathways to reclaim life after addiction and abuse. Attendees will leave with insights, tools, and inspiration for their own journeys, or to support those they love.

 Highlights:

 * Understand the basics of trauma psychology and emotional recovery
* Explore how early abuse and neglect impact current relationships
* Hear honest, heartfelt stories of recovery and resilience
* Learn expert perspectives on trauma psychology and healing
* Find strategies for rebuilding healthy relationships after abuse
* Complimentary lunch included
