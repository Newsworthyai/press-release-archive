# Dot Ai Scales Up: New Hardware Orders and Puerto Rico Plant Mark Next Phase of Growth

Dot Ai (Nasdaq: DAIC), an IoT and AI-based SaaS company at the forefront of Asset Intelligence technology, today announced it has secured $1.27 million in new orders for its hardware platform. These initial orders demonstrate continued momentum in the company’s growth trajectory and validates increasing market demand for Dot Ai’s innovative Asset Intelligence solutions.

 To fulfill this order influx and support sustained customer demand, Dot Ai will expand operations at its Barceloneta, Puerto Rico manufacturing facility by adding a second shift to increase production capacity. The company has also added additional capital equipment to support this order and future forecasted demand.

 “These new orders represent another important milestone as we continue to execute on our business plan and scale manufacturing of our innovative technology, validating the long-term vision of transforming how organizations manage their assets through in-process, AI-enabled solutions,” said Ed Nabrotzky, CEO of Dot Ai. “The continued momentum we’re experiencing reinforces our belief that we’re positioned at the forefront of a fundamental shift in asset intelligence and supply chain optimization. As we expand our Puerto Rico operations to meet this growing demand, we’re building the foundation for sustained growth and delivering on our commitment to revolutionize Asset Intelligence across industries.”

 The Puerto Rico facility, which began production earlier this year, serves as Dot Ai’s central manufacturing hub for its patent-pending Zero Infrastructure Mesh (ZiM) Bridge and industrial-grade smart asset tags. The facility is equipped with multiple production stations and has already created several full-time, highly skilled positions since becoming operational. This expansion marks the first step in Dot Ai’s broader manufacturing strategy, with plans to scale production across additional geographies over time.

 The new orders service multiple industry sectors where Dot Ai’s solutions are gaining traction, including logistics and manufacturing. The diverse order base reflects the broad applicability of Dot Ai’s Asset Intelligence platform across various industries.
