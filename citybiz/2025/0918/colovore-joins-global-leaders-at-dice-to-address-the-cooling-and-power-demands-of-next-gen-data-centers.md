# Colovore Joins Global Leaders at DICE to Address the Cooling and Power Demands of Next-Gen Data Centers

Colovore, the high-density colocation data center provider enabling AI, HPC, and enterprise workloads, announced today that Michael Fulkerson, Vice President of Facilities & Operations, will speak on a featured panel at the DICE Data Center Management, Operations & Cooling-West conference in Santa Clara, CA, taking place October 2, 2025.

 The panel, The Future of Data Center Cooling: How Will High Density Chips Impact Cooling and Power Infrastructure?, will explore the escalating technical challenges operators face as GPUs push toward 1000kW per rack. This exponential rise in density is forcing the industry to rethink every layer of facility design from heat rejection and cooling efficiency to power delivery and long-term scalability. Panelists will share how leading organizations are preparing for these near-term realities and what innovations are needed to sustain the next wave of digital infrastructure growth.
