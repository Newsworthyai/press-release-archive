# Mawson Infrastructure Group Shares Corporate Update

MIDLAND, Pa., Sept. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Mawson Infrastructure Group Inc. (NASDAQ: MIGI), a technology company that provides digital infrastructure for high-performance computing and digital assets, is hereby providing a corporate update to stockholders and the investment community regarding the Company’s current operations.

 Key Points

 * Operational Continuity. Mawson continues to operate normally across its U.S. footprint, with Midland, Pennsylvania remaining a cornerstone facility supported by long-term site tenure.
* Nasdaq Listing Compliance Plan. Mawson engaged advisors and presented a plan to Nasdaq to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing standards as it works to maintain the listing of its common stock. Mawson recently received from Nasdaq an extension of time to regain compliance and maintain its listing on Nasdaq.
* Progress on Legacy Matters. Mawson is advancing efforts to resolve certain legacy legal matters as part of a broader program to strengthen the Company’s balance sheet.
* Company Presentation. Mawson has updated the Company Presentation posted on its website at www.mawsoninc.com.
* Financial Flexibility Maintained (Form S-3 Refresh). Our leadership remains focused on executing the Company’s growth strategy while maintaining operational flexibility and improving its balance sheet. We believe having an effective shelf registration statement enables us to remain well-positioned to support our customers, pursue growth opportunities, and navigate the evolving capital markets efficiently. As our previous Form S-3 registration statement expired, the Company has filed a new shelf registration statement on Form S-3 to enable Mawson to offer and sell securities as needed. However, filing a shelf registration statement does not mean new shares of our common stock are being immediately issued nor does it represent a change in the Company’s business strategy or financial condition.
