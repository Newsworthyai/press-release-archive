# Bluebox Launches Ice-as-a-Service Enterprise Solution for Qualified Multi-Unit Convenience and Grocery Franchisees

Bluebox Smart Ice and Water announces today the expansion of its innovative Ice-as-a-Service (IaaS) solution to qualified multi-unit franchisees in the convenience and grocery sectors. This new enterprise-focused offering enables franchise operators to avoid the high capital expenditures and operational headaches associated with traditional packaged ice machines and delivery models, while providing sustainable revenue streams.

 Using an exclusive licensing agreement for the convenience store sector, Bluebox Ice as a Service utilizes Everest Ice and Water Systems’ VersaVendTM proprietary ice vending equipment. With machines operating nonstop, Bluebox eliminates inventory shortages, labor waste, customer complaints, after-hours sales restrictions, and environmental impact. This transforms what was once a costly problem into a profitable business solution.

 “Our mission with Bluebox is to transform a historically flawed supply chain into a profitable asset for multi-unit operators who qualify,” said Ben Gaskill, CEO of Bluebox Smart Ice and Water. “By providing zero capital expenditure, no maintenance costs, and guaranteed uptime, we empower multi-unit franchisees to increase ice and water sales without the risks, inefficiencies, or waste that have troubled this industry for decades.”

 Early adopters of the model during an Everest Ice and Water Systems pilot have already seen strong results. “Since bringing on-demand ice solutions into our locations, we’ve experienced more consistent uptime, happier customers, and a 100-200% increase in ice revenue,” said Matt Webb, a multi-unit franchisee partner with Circle K. “The ability to rely on Bluebox’s team without the cost and burden of managing ice delivery or equipment will be a game-changer for our operations.”

 Bluebox’s Ice-as-a-Service model and its strategic partnership with Everest position convenience and grocery franchisees to maximize profitability with no upfront investment through its Zero Requirements Agreement, which covers equipment, maintenance, and storage. Bluebox continues to lead the industry in innovation, uptime, and performance.
