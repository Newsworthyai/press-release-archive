# Kwikset Expands Smart Home Security Portfolio with Kwikset FLEX Garage Door Opener and Halo Select Plus Deadbolt

Kwikset®, a trusted leader in residential security and a registered trademark of ASSA ABLOY Americas Residential Inc., an ASSA ABLOY Group Company, today announced an expanded lineup of connected solutions launching this fall. The new products include the Kwikset FLEX Smart Garage Door Opener, the Halo Select Plus, and additional style variants of the Halo Select. Together, these innovations reinforce Kwikset’s commitment to making every entry point in the home smarter, convenient and more secure.

 The Kwikset FLEX Smart Garage Door Opener represents Kwikset’s first entry into the garage access category. Available in two models, Kwikset FLEX delivers connected convenience, robust security and flexible control backed by more than 75 years of trusted home protection. Homeowners can operate their garage doors remotely through the Kwikset app or from their vehicles using Apple CarPlay, Android Auto or HomeLink. The Kwikset FLEX 800 model features a three-quarter horsepower motor with long-lasting LED lighting, while the Kwikset FLEX 1000B offers a one-horsepower motor, brighter lighting and a built-in battery backup for uninterrupted operation. Both models include quiet operation, installer-friendly features and Kwikset’s patented anti-theft door release, which helps prevent forced entry.

 “Kwikset FLEX is an important extension of our single-family electronics portfolio,” said Jeff Sandoval, director of electronics marketing at Kwikset. “It complements our family of connected products to deliver a complete residential access control solution.”

 Kwikset is also expanding its popular Halo portfolio with the introduction of the Halo Select Plus, a smart lock with home key in Apple Wallet® and Matter support. With a simple tap of a home key on iPhone® or Apple Watch®, homeowners can unlock their doors quickly and securely, adding an extra layer of convenience to everyday living. Halo Select Plus is priced at $342.

 Halo Select Plus builds on the features of the original Halo Select released in fall 2024 with remote access via the Kwikset® app and built-in Wi-Fi, convenient keyless entry with schedulable access codes, and a discreet door status sensor. An event log and tamper alerts provide real-time phone notifications, giving homeowners confidence that their doors are secure. The lock also integrates with Amazon Alexa®, Apple Home® and Google Home® for voice commands and automations, with optional Matter over Thread connectivity for quick and reliable smart home communication.

 Halo Select Plus is offered in Satin Nickel and Matte Black finishes and features a sleek, low-profile look. Installation is simple and requires only a screwdriver.

 “Halo Select Plus brings a new level of convenience by letting homeowners unlock their doors the way that works best for them,” Sandoval said. “Whether through a home key in Apple Wallet, the Kwikset app, voice control or a personal code, it puts choice and security in the homeowner’s hands.”

 To give homeowners more design flexibility, Kwikset is also expanding the original Halo Select line. Halo Select will now be available in a Contemporary style, available through Amazon, Lowe’s, and other retailers, and a Soft Modern style, launching exclusively at The Home Depot. These join the existing Transitional style variant, giving homeowners even more ways to align smart security with the style of their homes. The new Halo Select variants will be priced at $298.

 The Kwikset FLEX Smart Garage Door Opener will begin rolling out in select U.S. markets in mid-October, followed by nationwide availability in November. Halo Select Plus and the new Halo Select variants will be available through major retailers this fall.
