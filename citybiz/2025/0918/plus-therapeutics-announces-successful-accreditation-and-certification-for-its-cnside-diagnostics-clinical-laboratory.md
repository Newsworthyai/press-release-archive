# Plus Therapeutics Announces Successful Accreditation and Certification for Its CNSide Diagnostics Clinical Laboratory

CNSide Diagnostics, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Plus Therapeutics, a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing targeted radiotherapeutics with advanced platform technologies for central nervous system (CNS) cancers, announces that it has received a certificate of accreditation from CMS for its lab located in Houston, Texas. Following the recent planned laboratory audit, successful certificate of accreditation deems the lab compliant with Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations enforced by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which are federal standards for laboratories performing testing on human specimens.

 “This is a key milestone on our trajectory to bring the CNSide cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assay platform to the broadest possible set of patients with or at risk for CNS cancers and simultaneously underscores our commitment to the highest quality standards,” said Russ Bradley, CNSide Diagnostics, LLC President and General Manager. “Furthermore, accreditation is the latest tangible accomplishment in our U.S. market access and launch strategy.”

 The certification ensures laboratories meet all requirements for proficiency testing, personnel qualifications, and quality control. Furthermore, achievement of this milestone is necessary to achieve a number of additional milestones such as:

 * Obtaining state licensure in 48 of 50 states
* Ensuring broad-based commercial insurance coverage: Lab accreditation is necessary to secure reimbursement for patient testing from the broadest possible set of private payors
* Accessing government payor coverage: Lab accreditation is a mandatory requirement for labs to enroll in Medicare and Medicaid programs and receive payments for testing services
* Expanding payment coding: Lab accreditation is a necessary step for broad pursuit and registration of unique reimbursement billing codes
