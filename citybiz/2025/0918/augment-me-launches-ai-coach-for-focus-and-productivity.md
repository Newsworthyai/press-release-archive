# Augment Me Launches AI Coach for Focus and Productivity

Augment Me, a self-described “cognitive alignment” startup, has introduced WotNow?!, a mobile AI agent that gives real-time prompts to help students and professionals regain focus, structure their day around peak energy windows, and support mental well-being. The app is available on iPhone and Android, and the company is also offering an API for enterprises.

 WotNow?! assesses users’ engagement and concentration by reading subtle biometric signals with a phone’s camera using privacy-first remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). When it detects a dip in attention, it responds with simple, actionable nudges designed to restore focus and flow. Over time, the agent maps each person’s Peak Performance Times so they can align demanding tasks with their natural rhythms.

 Founder and CEO Sameer Yami frames the product as a counterweight to both disengagement and the misuse of AI: “Disengagement is the hidden productivity killer,” he said, arguing that matching state-to-task is a better way to learn, teach, and work, an approach he says AI now makes practical.

 He readily acknowledges that AI is being used in ways that harm cognitive performance and productivity, particularly when it’s used to outsource tasks. He thinks it’s crucial that we rethink the paradigm, reorienting AI to be human-centric. While in some contexts AI can amplify our capabilities, it can also help us focus better and adapt thoughtfully, so we work and learn more effectively.

 The company says its methods were validated through pilots in schools and workplaces and a two-year study that included underserved Title I schools. According to Augment Me, the system boosted focus, reduced stress, and lifted standardized test scores, surpassing national growth benchmarks by 100–400+ points in some cases (CityBiz reviewed a pre-print of the forthcoming study).

 Beyond individual coaching, Augment Me is building room-level attention sensing. This includes contexts like reading engagement patterns across a classroom or conference room to give presenters real-time feedback on how well they’re holding the audience and how to re-engage those whose attention is drifting. The startup notes it was selected among the Top 200 at TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield, and its release of WotNow?! marks a milestone on its path to transform how humans and AI interact.
