# Streamline Scientific Launches Advanced PCR Reporting Service to Support Smarter UTI Care and Strengthen Antibiotic Stewardship

Streamline Scientific, a provider of advanced molecular testing and intelligent reporting services, today announced the launch of its enhanced PCR reporting service for urinary tract infection (UTI) testing, designed to help providers and reference labs reduce inappropriate antibiotic use and strengthen stewardship initiatives.

 Every year in the U.S., UTIs account for more than 10 million doctor visits. In many of those cases, antibiotics are prescribed before lab results are available – and as many as 30% turn out to be the wrong choice. That not only impacts patient recovery but also fuels the broader problem of antimicrobial resistance. Streamline Scientific’s enhanced reporting service addresses this by weaving CLSI M100 guidelines directly into PCR reports, giving providers clearer, more actionable information on the pathogens detected and their resistance markers. CLSI M100 is the leading industry guidance used for microbiology culture and sensitivity of UTIs. The mission of the CLSI M100 subcommittee is to provide useful information to enable laboratories to assist the clinician in the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for patient care.

 “Antibiotic stewardship is one of the most pressing challenges in healthcare today, and UTIs are a major contributor to inappropriate prescribing,” said Shawn Hood, president of Streamline Scientific. “Our enhanced PCR reporting service bridges the gap between lab results and treatment decisions, giving providers clearer insights based on the best available guidelines. It’s a cost-effective way to improve care while helping labs deliver greater value to their clients.”

 The enhanced reporting provides physicians with a more intuitive format that connects lab results to clinical guidelines. Instead of leaving providers to interpret raw PCR results, the reports connect each pathogen with relevant resistance markers and CLSI-based treatment guidance. For example, when E. coli is detected with sulfonamide or trimethoprim resistance, the report flags those drug classes as ineffective and points to better-supported alternatives. The result is faster, more confident prescribing that supports both patient care and antibiotic stewardship.

 “We designed this service with both labs and physicians in mind,” Hood added. “Labs get a way to deliver more meaningful results to their clients, and physicians receive reports that are easier to interpret and directly tied to treatment guidelines. It’s about making PCR more practical in everyday care.”

 The service offers clear benefits to both reference labs and medical practices. For labs, it provides a way to stand out in a crowded market, adding clinical value without requiring new equipment while giving their provider clients reports that directly support treatment decisions. For medical practices, it simplifies complex PCR data into actionable insights, making it easier to align with stewardship goals and strengthen relationships with patients and referring providers.

 Because it builds on existing PCR workflows, the service can be implemented quickly and without new investment in hardware or platforms. For more information, visit http://www.streamlinesci.com/reporting.
