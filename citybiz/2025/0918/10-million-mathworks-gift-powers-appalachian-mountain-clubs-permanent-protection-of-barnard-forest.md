# $10 Million MathWorks Gift Powers Appalachian Mountain Club’s Permanent Protection of Barnard Forest

The Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC), the nation’s oldest outdoor recreation and conservation organization, announced today that it has completed the acquisition of the Barnard Forest in Maine’s 100-Mile Wilderness thanks to a transformative $10 million gift from MathWorks, the leading developer of mathematical computing software. This acquisition secures nearly 29,000 acres of globally significant habitat and marks a major milestone in the Appalachian Mountain Club’s landmark Maine Woods Initiative, which now totals 127,710 acres.

 The gift from MathWorks, the second-largest philanthropic contribution in AMC’s history, enabled the organization to finalize its purchase of the Barnard Forest from The Conservation Fund and The Malone Family Land Preservation Foundation years ahead of schedule, accelerating conservation outcomes in one of the most ecologically important landscapes in the eastern United States.

 “This gift from MathWorks is more than generous — it’s catalytic,” said Nicole Zussman, President and CEO of AMC. “It enables us to safeguard an irreplaceable landscape, ensuring its health, access, and biodiversity are permanently protected. MathWorks has made a profound investment not just in land, but in climate resilience, community opportunity, and ecological continuity. I’m grateful they shared our vision and accelerated our ability to protect this landscape two years faster than we’d even hoped.”

 The Barnard Forest, a nearly 29,000-acre working forest in Piscataquis County, lies within the Pleasant River watershed, home to the last naturally reproducing population of landlocked salmon in Maine. The forest includes more than 70 miles of stream corridors, critical spawning grounds for endangered sea-run Atlantic salmon, extensive spruce-fir flats, and associated wetlands that provide cold-water habitat for native brook trout and landlocked smelt. The land protects an uninterrupted, undeveloped forest from the Appalachian Trail highlands to the main stem of the Pleasant River, a total continuous conserved land of over 750,000 acres, nearly the size of the White Mountain National Forest.

 This conservation milestone was made possible through AMC’s strategic partnership with The Conservation Fund. In 2023, The Conservation Fund and The Malone Family Land Preservation Foundation jointly acquired the southern portion of the Barnard property, giving AMC the time needed to raise funds for its permanent protection. The Conservation Fund’s share was purchased through its Working Forest Fund, with support from the Richard King Mellon Foundation. Today’s announcement brings together the shared vision of multiple partners focused on conservation to permanently protect the property well ahead of schedule.

 “This is precisely the type of meaningful, high-impact work The Conservation Fund was created to tackle,” said Tom Duffus, the Fund’s vice president and northeast representative based in Freeport. “Through swift and strategic action, we collaborated to successfully protect this vital place to create lasting benefits for the great state of Maine, local residents, and this region’s many visitors.”

 Under the Appalachian Mountain Club’s stewardship, the Barnard Forest will support restoration forestry, habitat connectivity, and climate adaptation. The property will be managed to Forest Stewardship Council standards, with plans to rebuild older forest conditions and expand carbon stocking, which is an integral part of the organization’s broader climate strategy. The forest also contributes to rural economic growth by helping support more than 50 forestry- and recreation-related jobs and reinforcing the AMC’s $8.39 million annual economic impact in the region. The property will remain on the tax rolls of Piscataquis County.

 “Barnard represents a true convergence of conservation opportunity, ecological importance, and public benefit,” added Steve Tatko, Vice President of Land and Conservation for the Appalachian Mountain Club. “This land was closed to the public for nearly 20 years. Thanks to MathWorks, The Conservation Fund, and countless donors and partners, it will now remain open to future generations for fishing, hunting, recreation, and cultural use, including tribal access. AMC is proud to live its values in a forest like this in service of ecology and people, for the benefit of both.”

 Initial funding for this project came from the Richard King Mellon Foundation, the EJK Foundation, and other lead individuals and foundations. AMC’s three-year campaign to protect and reopen Barnard Forest resulted in nearly $24 million in gifts, grants, and program-related investments to support the acquisition, perpetual stewardship, and capital necessary to re-establish public access to Barnard Forest. MathWorks completed the purchase of the Barnard Forest with a transformative $10 million donation, part of its commitment to sustainability and science-based climate solutions.

 “At MathWorks, we believe in solutions that scale, endure, and benefit both people and the planet,” said MathWorks SVP and CFO Jeanne O’Keefe. “Supporting the permanent protection of Barnard Forest reflects this commitment. We’re proud to help accelerate the Appalachian Mountain Club’s work in the Maine Woods and protect this extraordinary landscape for future generations.”

 The Barnard Forest acquisition is part of AMC’s Maine Woods Initiative, the largest multi-use conservation and recreation project in the eastern United States. With this addition, the initiative now encompasses nearly 130,000 contiguous acres — an area nearly three times the size of Acadia National Park.

 Since its founding in 1876, the Appalachian Mountain Club has led major conservation milestones, including advocacy for the creation of the White Mountain National Forest. Under Nicole Zussman’s leadership, the organization is building a bold new legacy, one rooted in science, scaled through partnership, and focused on lasting impact for the land and the people who depend on it.
