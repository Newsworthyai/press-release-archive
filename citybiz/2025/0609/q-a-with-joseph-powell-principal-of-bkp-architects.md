 A founding partner of BKP, Powell instilled in the firm his background in library design – he won the international competition to design the Evanston (Illinois) Public Library in 1991 – as well as his thoughtful, people-focused approach to architecture. Engaging with stakeholders is an important part of every project.

 Why did you choose to become an architect?

 I was planning to go to the University of Miami to study marine biology. But a required high-school career-aptitude test overwhelmingly said I’d be good at architecture. So, I switched my intended major and found I really liked the studio culture. It wasn’t a bold moment where everything clicked, but it felt like the right path. I transferred to Temple University and had a few really good professors who pushed me to learn and read more; they helped my interest in architecture snowball.

 Describe your career trajectory and the founding of BKP.

 My first few jobs were with Temple professors. I learned a gazillion little things in the early years that I still do today, from detailing millwork to being attentive to clients. I learned to believe that while not everything is a jewel box, you can approach it that way. Architecture can always be thoughtful, well-detailed, and deliberate, regardless of scope or budget. I had this in mind when I decided on a whim to enter the Evanston competition. With the winnings, I was able to start my practice and – with a lot of help from excellent collaborators – successfully complete that building.

 BKP describes its philosophy as advocating pragmatism in equal measure with creativity. Explain the relationship between these two.

 Creativity comes from pragmatism, from listening to what your client wants, what they need, and what makes them happy. Architecture is about problem solving, and the best way to find solutions is to understand the problems in the first place. Then you can get creative in ways the client never imagined.

 Your design work has focused on community-based architecture – from libraries and community centers to public recreation facilities and even zoos. What do these projects have in common?

 Everybody can visit or use these projects. It’s egalitarian in a sense that I’m always thinking about how different people will encounter the space. It’s important to me as a way of giving back. Lots of people have helped me get here, from parents to classmates to teachers to colleagues. I take what I know from interrelationships and my architectural experience and make buildings and spaces that will be enjoyable for all different kinds of people.

 What’s your personal approach to design?

 I don’t design in a vacuum. I want to talk to people. I want to listen and really try to understand the challenges they face and discover what they need. And then it’s my job to educate them on what’s possible. The conversational design development – discussing, drawing, refining – means that eventually, every stakeholder feels like they’ve contributed to the process. More importantly, this approach builds trust.

 What recommendations would you give to someone hiring an architect for the first time?

 Hire someone who won’t bring preconceived notions to the project, someone who will listen, truly understand, and come up with the best solution. Obviously, you want someone with experience, but not necessarily in the exact same building type. Sometimes the best architect is someone who hasn’t designed a very similar project in the past, because he or she will work hard to understand it.

 You’ve been involved with professional leadership, on the boards of AIA Philadelphia and AIA Pennsylvania and in organization such as the American Library Association. Why is it important for architects to be involved in their professional communities?

 We all have a voice and a point of view. If you want to really understand how issues affect business and practice, or if you want to effect change, you have to be part of industry leadership. You can’t sit on the sidelines and complain. It’s also good to get a firsthand look at how and why policies are made and how governance works. And the numbers mean something. When I was with AIA Pennsylvania, increasing membership helped to gain an additional voice on the national board; this made a difference for Pennsylvania architects. Even your personal involvement can make you a more well-rounded person, able to appreciate other people’s points of view. My volunteer work with Mount Airy Baseball and Plays and Players Theater have also informed my perspective.

 What advice do you have for young architects as they begin their careers?

 Listen and learn. Don’t come in thinking you know how to do everything, even things you’ve done before. The more you listen, the more your knowledge will grow. This goes beyond the office to getting involved in your professional and personal communities so you can broaden your perspective, build new relationships, and learn the nuance of the business of architecture. Find things you can do that no one else can do, especially if these further the goals of your firm. Through all of this, you’ll make yourself indispensable while building an enriching career for yourself and your clients.
