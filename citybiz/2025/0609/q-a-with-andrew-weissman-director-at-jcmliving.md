 Can you tell us the backstory about what brought you to the real estate industry?

 My grandfather was in the real estate business, and growing up, he was someone I looked up to deeply. I was always intrigued by the way he worked and the impact he had on people’s lives—providing homes, shaping neighborhoods. I remember walking door to door with him greeting tenants, giving out pieces of hard candy, telling people to have a sweet day. That early exposure is a beloved, standout memory and made an indelible mark, sparking my interest and setting me on this path. Over time, it grew into a real passion, and I knew I wanted to build a career that combined operational excellence with a sense of purpose.

 What’s the most interesting or amusing story from your career so far?

 Oh, there’s one I’ll never forget. Years ago, in a high-rise building we managed in Queens, we got a call about a mysterious leak. Turns out, a tenant had set up a full-sized 300-gallon inflatable pool in the second bedroom of their apartment. The pool was slowly leaking into the unit below. The real lesson there? Always make sure your leases are airtight—and when a resident reports something odd, take it seriously. You never know what you’ll find.

 Do you have a favorite life lesson quote?

 Author Jim Rohn once said, “You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” It reminds me to be intentional about who I surround myself with. One of the biggest reasons I decided to work for JCMLiving and the Schron family is the caliber of people I work with every day. I’m surrounded by folks who lead with integrity, and that influence shapes how I show up every day.

 Are you working on any exciting new projects now?

 Absolutely. Our flagship project, Rosera Wesmont in Wood-Ridge, NJ, has been years in the making (24 years to be exact!). It’s a luxury residential community built on the site of the historic Curtiss-Wright aircraft facility. We’ve transformed that industrial land into something really special—295 modern homes with a hospitality mindset including 35,000 square feet of coveted amenities. We have pool cabanas, a golf simulator, you name it. All within a short distance from New York City. It’s uplifting the standard of living in the area and creating a unique type of community.

 What makes your company stand out?

 What sets JCMLiving—and the broader Cammeby’s organization apart—is that we always put residents’ needs first. Years ago, during a massive heating upgrade, we basically hit a wall with a contractor who just wasn’t moving fast enough. It would’ve been cheaper to wait—much cheaper. But that meant the tenants would be without heat. Our leader didn’t blink. He said, “What’s it going to cost to get it done now?” The number was outrageous, but he approved it. No debate. Residents come first. Always.

 None of us achieve success alone. Who helped you along the way?

 My role models instilled in me that if you give back to the community, personal success will find you; I try to live by this maxim. Although, honestly speaking, my family has really been my biggest motivator. Having a wonderfully supportive wife, and the blessings of children, I found a new level of drive and motivation to ensure their bright future. My children are so inspiring to me, they’re why I do what I do.

 

What are 3 things that excite you about real estate?

 1. First, the variety—every day is different, and I’m constantly learning across disciplines: construction, finance, community management, design.
2. Second, the creative side—I love shaping environments and coming up with new ways to solve problems or enhance tenant experience.
3. And third, transformation. Seeing an undeveloped site transform into a vibrant community, that is now Rosera Wesmont, is incredibly rewarding.

 What are 3 things that concern you—and how would you improve them?

 Concern #1: The affordable housing system. It needs reform. Many people in these programs no longer meet the qualifications but remain in place, blocking access for those in true need. We need better vetting and policies to help successful tenants transition, making room for others.

 Concern #2: Real estate policies that understand economic realities like rising taxes, mortgage rates and insurance premiums. Fundamentally, having reforms that align rent caps with actual cost increases according to the surrounding economic circumstances, to keep buildings viable.

 Concern #3: Overregulation. Layers of zoning and permitting often delay good projects. Streamlining those processes would encourage innovation and support new housing supply.

 What advice would you give to leaders building strong teams and culture?

 Give people space to make decisions—and make mistakes. It’s the only way they’ll grow. I’ve seen our company flourish in unexpected ways simply because someone tried a new approach that worked even better than mine. Trust is the foundation of a great culture.

 What are 5 non-intuitive things one should know to succeed in real estate?

 1. Mutual respect and empathy – You’re dealing with people’s homes and lives. It’s not just business. I manage over 70 employees and 8,000 residents. You have to lead with empathy.
2. Patience is essential – Change doesn’t happen overnight. Real results come from small improvements over long periods.
3. Persistence matters –Most people stop trying at the cusp of success so I like to tell my team, don’t give up, success is around the corner!
4. Plan for the long term, starting now – You can’t wing it. Lay the groundwork today for what you want to build five years from now.
5. Real estate is a human business – It’s not about buildings. It’s about people and how they live, work, and thrive in the spaces you create.

 If you could inspire a movement, what would it be?

 I’d champion a movement to embed hospitality principles into residential living—where every building, regardless of rent level, operates with a culture of care. Everyone deserves to live in a place where they feel seen, safe, and supported. That mindset, in my opinion, could transform cities from the inside out.
