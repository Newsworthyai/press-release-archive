# Q&amp;A with Andrew Hitch, Kolter Homes’ Community Director for Cresswind at Spring Haven

With 25+ years of experience in the construction industry, Andrew Hitch is Kolter Homes’ Community Director for Cresswind at Spring Haven. His role is to shape the active adult neighborhood from the ground up. Focusing on site planning, design and construction, Andrew works to deliver state-of-the-art amenities and quality-built homes that stand the test of time.

 How did you get started in the building industry?

 I come from a family rooted in construction; my father and three older brothers were all in the industry. With five siblings, our summers were spent on hands-on home improvement projects led by my dad. After high school, I explored other interests, including IT and low-voltage home audio and video, but ultimately found my way back to construction. Over the years, I gained valuable experience working with a homebuilding supplier, a civil engineer, a low-voltage contractor and a power utility subcontractor. These roles built a strong foundation and led to an opportunity with a major production homebuilder, where I began as an Assistant Builder in 2005. Through these experiences, I discovered a genuine passion for building and shaping communities. There’s something deeply rewarding about creating lasting spaces that enhance people’s everyday lives.

 In 2014, I was ready to transition from the large production builder environment and sought a company that truly valued quality and innovation. When I reached out to a former colleague about an opportunity with Kolter Homes, I was initially hesitant. At the time, Kolter had only one community in Georgia, which presented some job security concerns for me and my family. However, after speaking with several contractors who had worked with Kolter, I was encouraged by the consistent praise for the company’s culture, commitment to excellence and thoughtful approach to community development. That gave me the confidence to take the leap, and it felt like the right opportunity to be part of something meaningful. I joined Kolter during its early expansion into the Atlanta market, starting as a Construction Manager at Cresswind at Lake Lanier. I later helped launch Cresswind Peachtree City as Director of Construction, and today, as Community Director, I’m proud to lead the development of another large-scale active adult community in Newnan, Cresswind at Spring Haven.

 What makes Cresswind at Spring Haven a unique active adult community?

 

 Kolter Homes’ dedication to creating neighborhoods where design, craftsmanship, and livability come together is evident in every aspect of the community. Cresswind at Spring Haven is designed specifically for active adults, offering a range of amenities that cater to their lifestyle needs.

 What does a “day in the life” as community director at Cresswind at Spring Haven look like?

 A typical day as Community Director at Cresswind at Spring Haven involves a dynamic mix of strategic oversight and hands-on leadership. I start by reviewing construction progress and coordinating with our sales, land development and customer service teams to ensure alignment with our overall community goals. Throughout the day, I monitor budgets, track key milestones and address any operational challenges that arise. I also meet regularly with project teams to provide guidance and ensure that we deliver a high-quality experience for our homeowners. Whether it’s walking the site, reviewing schedules or reporting to senior leadership, every day is focused on keeping the community on track, on time, on budget and built to the highest standards.
