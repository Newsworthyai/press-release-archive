# TBC Uzbekistan Launches Fully Digital Insurance, Enters New Segment to Further Expand Ecosystem

TBC Uzbekistan, the leading digital banking ecosystem in Central Asia, announces the full rollout of TBC Insurance, as it continues to broaden its product offering and enter new high-growth segments.

 Fully integrated into the wider TBC Uzbekistan ecosystem and available via the TBC UZ banking app, the new product is transforming the customer experience for insurance users in Uzbekistan by providing a seamless and a fully digital service. Beginning with credit life insurance, the offering will be expanded to provide a full suite of personal insurance products going forward.

 TBC Insurance was initially soft launched in April 2025, after obtaining a life insurance license from the National Agency of Perspective Projects of Uzbekistan in March 2025. There has been strong demand from consumers for this new offering, with over 140,000 policies delivered to date.

 TBC Insurance is led by Ekaterina Lotuashvili, a senior executive with 25 years’ experience in the sector across the UK and Georgia, including at Lloyd’s of London, the world’s leading insurance marketplace.

 This move comes as TBC Uzbekistan continues to broaden its product offering and strengthen its position as the leading digital banking ecosystem in Central Asia. Building on strong momentum, including a registered user base that now exceeds 50% of the country’s population and year-on-year growth that saw revenue and the loan book double in Q1 2025, the company has launched a series of new products over the past year. These include the Salom debit card, Osmon credit card, as well as SME banking and lending services, creating powerful synergies across the ecosystem and driving deeper customer engagement.

 Nika Kurdiani, CEO of TBC Uzbekistan, commented: “We see insurance as a natural extension of the TBC Uzbekistan ecosystem – a product that empowers customers to feel more secure and in control of their financial lives. With the launch of TBC Insurance, we’re continuing to thoughtfully expand our digital banking ecosystem, ensuring each new product complements the others and enhances the overall value we deliver to our customers. Insurance will be a key part of this journey, helping to deepen engagement and strengthen trust in the ecosystem.”

 TBC Uzbekistan is part of London-listed TBC Bank Group, a leading provider of modern, tech-enabled financial services in the Caucasus and Central Asia. In addition to TBC Uzbekistan, the Group operates TBC Georgia, the leading financial services provider in the South Caucasus nation with a 38% market share in customer loans and a 37% share of customer deposits.
