# Park Terrace Celebrates 25 Years of Southern California’s Spanish Heritage with a Festive Anniversary Event

Park Terrace, a distinguished Kisco Senior Living community, proudly marked its 25th anniversary on Friday, June 20th, with a vibrant celebration in the newly renovated Terra Sol Courtyard. This enchanting venue, characterized by its Spanish Colonial architecture and grand fountain, is surrounded by lush Magnolia trees and exquisite Crepe Myrtles, creating a picturesque backdrop for residents and families to enjoy al fresco dining, leisurely conversations, and serene strolls amidst nature’s beauty.

 The anniversary event not only commemorated the growth of the Park Terrace community but also introduced “Sabor,” an exciting new Spanish Tapas Restaurant set to open later this summer. The name “Sabor,” meaning “to savor” in English, reflects the community’s commitment to providing residents with delightful culinary experiences.

Highlights include marinated Castelvetrano olives, Manchego cheese, local white sea bass with heirloom tomato and saffron sauce, and beef short rib with red wine reduction and parsley salad. To conclude the evening, guests will indulge in Crema Catalana scented with orange and lemon.

 “We believe in offering our residents diverse dining options that enhance their quality of life,” said Geno Koehler, Executive Director at Park Terrace. “The addition of Sabor, with its relaxing environment and daily changing menu, provides yet another reason for families to visit and enjoy quality time together.”

 

 Sabor represents more than just a new dining option; it underscores Park Terrace’s ongoing commitment to fostering a sense of community where residents’ voices are heard and their needs prioritized. In response to resident feedback for casual dining with high-quality food and service, the team has transformed the former Luciano’s restaurant into a welcoming space that caters to residents and families during lunch and dinner. Both Luciano’s Italian Trattoria for lunch and Sabor for dinner offer indoor and outdoor dining experiences tailored to the community’s desires.

 “Residents are truly experiencing life here at Park Terrace,” Koehler added. “We take pride in providing outlets and experiences that allow them to relax, connect, and enjoy quality time together—not just with their families but with each other.”
