# YMCA of the Palm Beaches Launches ‘Summer Fun(d)’ with Donation from Publix Super Markets Charities

The YMCA of the Palm Beaches has announced it has launched a special Summer Fun(d) to help the community “shine brighter this summer.” The fund will benefit local, underserved families in its Palm Beach County service area by providing financial assistance and scholarships, making it possible for individuals and families across our community to access Y programs and services. This includes swim lessons, after-school care, summer camp, or wellness classes. Support for the fund helps ensure that no one ever has to be turned away from the YMCA and its two wellness centers located at Palm Beach State University’s Lake Worth Beach and Palm Beach Gardens campuses, and its aquatic center located on Lake Worth Road.

 Publix Super Markets Charities kicked off the Summer Fun(d) with a $17,000 grant to fund memberships for individuals and families in the Y’s service area. Publix Charities’ mission is to support nonprofit organizations that assist people in need within the communities in which they serve, so they have the opportunity to lead successful lives. Publix Super Markets was founded by George Jenkins, a profound advocate of giving back to a number of nonprofit organizations, a legacy that Publix Charities faithfully continues to support.

 “We deeply appreciate the generous support of Publix Super Markets Charities in fostering programs that nurture a healthy spirit, mind, and body,” said Tim Coffield, President and CEO of the YMCA of the Palm Beaches.

 Summer is a busy time at the YMCA of the Palm Beaches, as the organization hosts Summer Swim Camps, Weekends at the Y, and ongoing swimming lessons to kids and adults with all abilities. “This is an ideal time to make an investment in the futures of those who we serve in our community, particularly our children,” said Coffield.
