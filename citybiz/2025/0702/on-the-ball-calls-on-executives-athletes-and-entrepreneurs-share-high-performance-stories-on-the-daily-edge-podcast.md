# On the Ball Calls on Executives, Athletes and Entrepreneurs Share High-Performance Stories on The Daily Edge Podcast

On the Ball, a family-owned, award-winning sales and leadership coaching agency, is inviting athletes, entrepreneurs, executives, and builders who have earned their edge through lived experience to share their stories on The Daily Edge Podcast. The Daily Edge Podcast is a weekly show that explores business, sports and life within the perspective of performance.

 Hosted by Steve Nudelberg, Marc Nudelberg, and Jake Nudelberg, a father and two sons who built On the Ball, a multi-million-dollar, award-winning sales and leadership coaching company, The Daily Edge combines high-performance insights with real-world application, cultural relevance, and some family banter. This fast-moving, impactful show is designed to fuel personal and professional growth with lessons that listeners can apply immediately.

 The Daily Edge is a conversation about the pressure moments, the pivots, the wins that mattered, and the failures that taught more. The Nudelbergs want to hear from guests who built something, led through a challenge, showed up when it counted most, or have expertise on a timely topic that matters.

 “Our podcast is about helping people show up better in work, in life and in leadership with real, actionable conversations rooted in curiosity, coaching, and performance,” said Marc Nudelberg, president of On the Ball. “We’re looking forward to bringing on more powerful guests to feature stories that challenge, inspire, and deliver actionable takeaways for our driven audience.”

 Offering over 100 years of combined experience across business and sports, the hosts include:

 * Steve Nudelberg – Entrepreneur, sales coach, and boardroom closer. Built and sold multiple companies, now coaches CEOs and elite sales teams.
* Marc Nudelberg – Former D1 football coach (Florida State University, University of Cincinnati and University of Florida), now President of On the Ball and trusted advisor to top executives.
* Jake Nudelberg – Worked under Dan Mullen at University of Florida as a football assistant coach. He now leads brand and content at On the Ball and runs his own fitness brand, Get Jaked.

 Each Monday, two new episodes drop, starting with one powerful question and ending with practical takeaways so that guests can use them in their work, mindset, and life. The Daily Edge is distributed across YouTube, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major platforms.

 On the Ball is looking for guests with stories for real conversations, the kind that get under the hood of leadership, performance, failure, and growth. The podcasts are professionally produced and pre-recorded using audio and video in their in-person studio in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Each episode is about 15 to 25 minutes.

 Guests will receive full production support, personalized episode topics, professionally edited short form clips for social media, shares across all host and show social media channels, and most importantly, real conversation, real impact and real fun.

 Any athletes, entrepreneurs, executives, and builders who have earned their edge are welcome to apply by filling out this form: https://forms.gle/jBf3o3bMuAnXsrwV7.
