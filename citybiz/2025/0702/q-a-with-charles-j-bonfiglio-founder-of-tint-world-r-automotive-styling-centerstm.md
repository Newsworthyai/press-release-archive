# Q&amp;A with Charles J. Bonfiglio, Founder of Tint World® Automotive Styling Centers™

Charles J. Bonfiglio is the founder and CEO of Tint World® Automotive Styling Centers, the largest and fastest-growing automotive accessories and window tinting franchise in the U.S. A franchise industry veteran with over 40 years of experience, Charles has grown Tint World® from six independent automotive accessory and window tinting centers to a global brand known for high-performance services and strong franchisee support. Charles is passionate about helping entrepreneurs succeed through a proven business model, innovative marketing, and ongoing operational support.

 You started out as a franchisee and eventually built Tint World® into an international franchise brand—how did your experience on both sides of the franchise equation shape the way you lead today?

 Coming up as a franchisee with Meineke really gave me a deep understanding of what it feels like to be in their shoes. I wasn’t some corporate guy sitting behind a desk telling people what to do… I lived it. I built my own stores from the ground up, figured out how to grow, how to manage teams, how to survive when nobody else had the blueprint. I’ve always said, I’m just like you, only maybe I’ve been doing it a little longer. So when I work with franchisees today, I lead from that place. I understand their struggles, their goals, their family pressures. I make sure they know that I’ve got their back, and I push them to lead their own teams, build leaders, and not just get stuck in the day-to-day. That’s why our culture is different: it’s real and it’s personal. I bring my whole team to our conventions because I want everyone connected. We’re not some distant corporate machine; we’re all family.

 What role does technology play in staying competitive in the automotive services space, and how does Tint World® continue to innovate in that area?

 Technology’s huge. I’ve always been on the front edge of that, even back in the Meineke days when no one wanted computers, I jumped right in. I’m not a coder or anything, but I know how to design systems that make life easier for our franchisees. At Tint World®, we’re constantly evolving our tech stack because if you’re not growing, you’re falling behind. We’ve brought in platforms like Zoom Accelerator that help monitor and coach phone performance across all stores using AI, real-time data that helps franchisees get better. We are cautious though; I always make sure our data is protected, and don’t just jump on shiny new tech because it’s popular. It’s got to actually serve our franchisees and customers. The goal is to make things more transparent, more efficient, and give our stores that extra edge in customer service and operations.

 What are the key traits or mindsets you look for in a franchisee, and how do you help turn motivated individuals into successful business owners?

 When looking for the right franchisee, I look for people I like and trust… that’s number one. I’ve found that if I like you, chances are customers will like you, too. I’ve learned to watch out for people who just think this is a cool hobby. You’ve got to have heart, hustle, and you’ve got to want to build a real business. We talk about building leaders, if you just want to be in your store all day and not grow the people around you, you’re going to hit a ceiling. I like to tell my franchisees, if you ever need me, whether it’s business advice, leadership coaching, or even just life stuff, I’m here. I do coaching calls at 5:30 in the morning if they want it. I always say I want to get them to success four times faster than it took me. I’ve walked the road, so I try to help them avoid any potholes.

 As the automotive services industry evolves, what challenges do you foresee—and how is Tint World® preparing to stay ahead of those shifts?

 The automotive industry’s changing fast… electric vehicles, advanced driver systems, all of it. The challenge is staying relevant and offering services that today’s cars need. It’s about keeping the menu fresh and making sure our franchisees are trained to tackle new categories. Technology will keep pushing us, and we’ll keep leaning into it, but at the same time, we won’t ever lose the personal touch. I always tell my team that we can’t stand still. We have to stay nimble and ahead of what’s coming at all times. And we do just that.

 Looking back on your journey, what leadership lessons stand out as the most important in building a resilient, scalable brand that still feels personal?

 For me, leadership’s about building more leaders. I can’t, and shouldn’t, do it all on my own. I’ve learned to hire people that I trust, people who get it, people who have the heart. And I’ve learned the power of staying in your lane and focusing, no shiny object chasing. The culture we’ve built at Tint World® is special because it’s truly family-oriented and collaborative, and we really do care about each other. I’ve seen how the right vision attracts the right people. Even when I thought I was the worst at hiring, it turns out people joined because they believed in where we were going. I think keeping the personal touch even as you scale, that’s what makes the difference. You’ve got to love what you do and love the people you’re doing it with.

 Looking ahead to the future, what franchise development/growth goals do you have for the brand?

 We’ve got about 150 stores open now, another 100 in the pipeline, and I’m still just getting started. We slowed down a bit to make sure we were opening the right stores, helping the right people, and not just adding location for the sake of growth. But now we’re flipping the switch again towards growth. The goal is responsible franchising – making sure the franchisees that come in are all in, and if it’s not the right fit, we help them transition out the right way. I want Tint World® to keep growing smart, keep leading the industry, and I want every franchisee to have a real shot at success. It’s not just about getting rich quick, it’s about building something solid for the long haul.
