 What inspired your vision for EverLine Coatings Baltimore, and how has it evolved since opening?

 After retiring from the U.S. Army, I always knew I wanted to be a business owner. About 13 years ago, I started exploring franchise opportunities. My brothers owned restaurant franchises, and their advice was to stay away from food service. That led me to try a tax business, but it wasn’t the right fit. I spent the next decade in government contracting, all while continuing to research potential businesses.

 When my husband suggested we look into restoration franchises, we found the market was oversaturated. Through a veteran entrepreneur network, we discovered EverLine Coatings. What stood out to me was the backend support, the systems, and the marketing tools. I loved the professionalism of their proposals, the software platform, and the way the brand was structured for success. My husband had been an owner-operator in the trucking industry for 30 years, and we realized this would be the perfect opportunity to work together and build something of our own.

 We officially opened in Baltimore in July 2024. Since then, our vision has grown to not only provide expert pavement maintenance services but also to become a trusted and recognizable name in the community.

 What has been one of your most challenging moments so far, and how did you manage it?

 One of the early challenges was navigating a very competitive market. We had opportunities where we came in second on 13 different bids. That was tough, but it also taught us to sharpen our approach and better communicate our value. We’ve been working on strategies to stand out, including focusing on quality, safety, and compliance. Over time, we’ve started to gain traction with larger contracts and more recurring business.

 What is one lesson you’ve learned that you wish you had known earlier in your business journey?

 The importance of adapting to the market without compromising your standards. Early on, I thought the best proposal and most structured approach would always win. But I quickly learned that relationships and flexibility are just as important. Now, I balance structure with responsiveness so we can meet client needs without sacrificing quality.

 How has your military and tech background prepared you for this role?

 I spent 21 years in the U.S. Army, with deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Kuwait. My final roles included working at the Pentagon as a senior communications leader, managing teams that supported IT infrastructure and operations. After the military, I transitioned into government contracting and earned advanced degrees in business and process engineering.

 That experience has helped tremendously. I’m used to working under pressure, managing complex logistics, and creating efficient systems. Those skills directly translate to running this franchise, from proposal writing to scheduling and customer service.

 What are some of your proudest early wins in the business?

 We’ve had some amazing early projects. One was with the Veterans of Foreign Wars organization, which meant a lot to me personally. We also completed airfield marking at a military installation, which was a great way to bring my past experience into the work we do today. We’re currently preparing to support multiple Raising Cane’s locations, and we just received an incredibly meaningful request from the Make-A-Wish Foundation to build a custom basketball court for a young girl.

 What advice would you give to aspiring entrepreneurs, especially veterans or women entering franchising?

 Use your experience as a foundation, not a limitation. The leadership, adaptability, and strategic thinking developed in the military or in any structured field are incredibly transferable. Do your research, know your market, and choose a business model that aligns with your skills and values. And don’t be afraid to ask for help. There’s a network out there ready to support you.
