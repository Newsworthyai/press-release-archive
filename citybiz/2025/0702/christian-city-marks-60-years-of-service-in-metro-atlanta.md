# Christian City Marks 60 Years of Service in Metro Atlanta

Anniversary milestone coincides with major growth, including new programs and housing

 In 1965, Christian City built a small cottage for children in the foster care system, with the support of concerned neighbors. Sixty years later, the Union City nonprofit has grown into a 500-acre campus that continues to support the wellbeing of children and has widened its scope to include families, young adults and seniors across Metro Atlanta. As Christian City celebrates its 60th anniversary, the nonprofit is embarking on a monumental year of growth and transformation, bolstering key programs and expanding its capacity to serve.

 Christian City is the only nonprofit in the region to collectively care for and build community for children, youth, families and senior adults. Its continuum of care includes residential group homes for children, foster and adoption services, support for youth experiencing homelessness, housing and care for youth who have aged out of foster care and supportive independent living for neuro-diverse adults.

 “Christian City is home to more than 1,000 residents on our multigenerational campus, guided by a founding mission to love our neighbors and inspire through faith,” said Keith Horton, President and CEO of Christian City. “For six decades, we have passionately remained committed to caring for society’s most vulnerable. We look forward to growing our legacy in the years ahead.

 This year, Christian City is set to launch new initiatives to expand housing and deepen its rich list of services.

 Senior Housing Expansion: Over the next three years, 160 new residential units for seniors will be built, representing a 70% increase in housing capacity for adults 55+. Currently an 80-unit, mixed-housing community is under construction on the campus, in partnership with National Church Residences.

 Senior Health Care Access: To continue supporting seniors, a partnership with Southern Regional Medical Center has allowed Christian City to offer medical services for seniors living on campus. The on-site clinic is open weekly, bringing routine preventative care and treatment directly to residents on campus.

 THRIVE Program & Neurodiverse Housing: A new partnership with Fayette County nonprofit Two Sparrows, allows Christian City to support young adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities with housing, community and skills-based programming.

 Thrift Store Refresh: Christian City’s beloved Graceland Thrift Store is undergoing a summer renovation to enhance the shopping experience. Local artist and former Children’s Village resident Arshaad Norwood will paint a mural on the store’s exterior—celebrating Christian City’s legacy of transformation.

 Future Development: Looking ahead, construction will soon begin on a 15-acre mixed-use village on Christian City’s campus. The development will serve as a front door for Christian City, featuring retail, residential, community-oriented users and a public green space, connecting with Union City’s new multi-use trail and a golf cart path that leads to the Christian City campus.

 “With the help of our generous supporters, staff, and community partners, we have laid the groundwork for our most transformative year yet, ” continued Horton. “These investments in new programs reflect our commitment to be a safe haven for all ages. In a society where people’s needs are becoming greater each day, we are rooted in Christ’s love, offering hope, healing and community to all.”

 A detailed overview of the eight programs and services provided by Christian City is below:

 * Children’s Village – A collection of family-style residential group homes on campus that provide safety, stability and love to vulnerable children.
* Crossroads – A foster care and adoption program that places teens, large sibling groups and children with special needs, while providing specialized training and support for parents.
* THRIVE – A transitional program offering youth aging out of the foster care system or experiencing homelessness with access to housing, education, supportive services and life-skills.
* Safe Place – A 24/7 national youth outreach and prevention program for runaway and youth experiencing homelessness in need of immediate help and safety.
* Healthy Families – A program that connects working families with critical resources, including housing, food and therapy, to stabilize families and avoid the need for state intervention or homelessness.
* Two Sparrows Village – In partnership with Christian City, this program provides a supportive living environment and day program on campus for neurodiverse adults
* Affordable Active Senior Living – An active, caring community of affordable senior housing, including life-lease patio homes and subsidized apartments.
* Health Care Facility – PruittHealth operates the assisted living center and the skilled nursing center on the Christian City campus.

 About Christian City, Inc.

 Christian City is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit rooted in the belief that everyone deserves a safe place to call home and a community that feels like family.

 It was established in 1965 when the first cottage for homeless children opened in south metro Atlanta on 50 acres of donated land. Active senior living homes were soon added, followed by skilled nursing and rehab and assisted living. PruittHealth operates the assisted living and skilled nursing centers on campus, and National Church Residences operates four HUD-supported apartment buildings. Our programs for children and families have expanded to include five distinct areas: residential group homes for children, foster and adoption services, runaway and homeless youth services, support and homes for youth who have aged out of foster care, and building healthy families. Today, more than 1,000 residents—children, youth, and senior adults—live on our 500-acre campus. Through each of its programs, Christian City seeks to extend Christ’s call to love your neighbor.
