# GoVA Foundation Partners with U.S. Century Bank to Expand Financial Education Access for Low- and Moderate-Income Military Families in Broward County

GoVA Foundation announces a strategic partnership with U.S. Century Bank, one of the largest community banks headquartered in Miami, to provide free digital financial education to low- and moderate-income (LMI) military families through GoVA’s innovative platform, The Edge.

 Through a Community Development grant from U.S. Century Bank, the program will serve 10 qualified military households in Broward County, Florida. The Edge platform offers interactive courses, financial calculators, and other digital resources designed to build financial independence and literacy within the military community.

 “We’re excited to partner with U.S. Century to expand access to critical financial education resources for military and veteran families in Southern Florida,” said George Earhart, the Executive Director of GoVA Foundation. “Our Edge platform’s user-focused design ensures participants can easily engage with and apply financial knowledge in ways that create lasting positive impact.”

 Martha Guerra-Kattou, EVP and Director of Sales & Marketing at U.S. Century, said this about the partnership: “Investing in our community by partnering with GoVA Foundation to provide military families with the financial tools they need aligns with our mission at U.S. Century Bank. We are proud to support the success and financial empowerment of these families through this meaningful collaboration.”

 GoVA Foundation was able to immediately fulfill this grant request due to the high demand for financial education among military families. With over 6,600 membership requests nationwide, GoVA quickly identified qualified households in Southern Florida to benefit from this program. The partnership provides these families with unlimited access to The Edge platform’s resources for 12 months.

 The partnership demonstrates U.S. Century Bank’s commitment to supporting the military community in Southern Florida and reflects both organizations’ dedication to expanding financial education access.
