# Q&amp;A with Marty Bores, Devonshire’s New Resident Life Director

Devonshire, the Erickson Senior Living community at PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., is excited to announce that William “Marty” Bores has been promoted to resident life director.

 “Marty is the heart and soul of our community,” says Executive Director Brad Andrus. “Since joining Devonshire in 2007, he has had such a positive impact on our community members and the vibrant, engaging lifestyle they enjoy.”

 Bores most recently served as the community’s resident life manager. As resident life director, he will oversee the community resources team, the fitness and wellness team, and the Welcome Home program, which helps incoming community members settle in. He also wishes to expand the activities and programming available at Chatsworth, the continuing care neighborhood that provides additional levels of support for Devonshire community members.

 Recently, Bores sat down with the Tribune to discuss his 18-year career at Devonshire and the many ways he and his team hope to meet–and exceed–the needs of community members.

 What led you to Devonshire?

 Previously, I was the director of operations at a resort in upstate New York. It was there that I discovered my passion for working with seniors, as many would come and stay with us for a few weeks each summer. When the resort was sold, I took that as an opportunity to explore a new career in Florida–one where I could work with seniors for longer than a week or two. I answered an ad for a position at Devonshire and was invited to the campus for an interview and tour.

 The first thing that struck me was the people. While waiting for my interview, I sat in the lobby and began chatting with some residents. By the time I was called in for my interview, we were laughing and hugging goodbye. They said they hoped to see me soon, and they did, as I was offered the position!

 What do you enjoy most about working at Devonshire?

 It is the greatest privilege to work with seniors. Each person has their own story–how they got to Devonshire, what they did, where they came from, where they traveled. I consider myself lucky, having heard a library of stories. I love getting to know each person, and, with the help of my team, finding new ways to support their vibrant, active lifestyles.

 Each new community member brings new ideas, and our team considers every idea. For instance, last year, several new community members requested personal training, which we introduced earlier this year. They love being able to wake up and make a choice, from many options, on what to do that day. Between our community resources and fitness teams, we offer 130 different activities each month.

 What would surprise people about the resident life experience at Devonshire?

 The number of community members who have come up to me and said, “If I had known that it would be this much fun, I would have moved sooner,” is too many to count. If you’re thinking about a move, come and spend the day at Devonshire–take a tour and talk to some of our community members. It’s a great way to learn more about the community and the engaging lifestyle we offer. You might wish you had moved in sooner too!

 What would you like people to know about you?

 I was raised with a simple philosophy: Be kinder than you need to be. I put those words on the business cards that I’ve been handing out for more than 25 years. I believe in kindness and being a good person to everyone around you.

 Each year, Devonshire has a theme for the year. Last year was the Year of Kindness. This year is the Year of Gratitude. For us, it’s not just about coming to work. It’s about making a difference, whether that’s listening to or laughing with someone, sharing a story or memory, or introducing someone to a new friend.

 In fact, rather than celebrate the holidays with a lunch or party, the Devonshire executive team finds a way to help others. Last year, we prepared and served lunch for people staying at Quantum House, which offers temporary housing for families whose children are receiving treatment in Palm Beach County for a serious medical condition. I consider myself very lucky to work at a community with coworkers who believe in being kind.
