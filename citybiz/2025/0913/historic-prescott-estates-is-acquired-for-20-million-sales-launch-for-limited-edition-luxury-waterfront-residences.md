# Historic Prescott Estates is Acquired for $20 Million, Sales Launch for Limited Edition Luxury Waterfront Residences

Prescott Estates, a landmark waterfront single-family development parcel, has been acquired for $20 million and announces the launch of sales for one of Miami’s most anticipated luxury communities. Set along an irreplaceable stretch of open bay in the historic Bayside District, the project features a collection of only five ultra-luxury single-family estates, including the historic Prescott Mansion, set to be among South Florida’s most prestigious addresses.

 Procure Development, purchased the property and plans to begin construction of the estates in October. Chad Carroll of The Chad Carroll Group at Compass represented both sides of the transaction and will also lead exclusive sales and marketing for the development.

 “This is a true legacy project that will last for generations,” said Carroll. “Prescott Estates is a distinctive community where every home is connected through luxury and design integrity, yet each estate stands as a statement piece of its own.”

 The property itself is a once-in-a-lifetime canvas showcasing more than 1.4 acres of prime land in the heart of Miami with 345 feet of unobstructed water frontage, four deepwater docks designed for 100-foot yachts, and sweeping views of Biscayne Bay, downtown Miami, and Miami Beach.

 “Prescott Estates represents the only opportunity on Miami’s open bay to develop multiple estates side by side with a unified, elevated vision,” said Carroll. “The result is a rare community where each residence enhances the next, setting a new benchmark for waterfront living.”

 Brought to life by a world-class team including architects Ivan Kadey and Chris Fernandez, award-winning landscape designer Raymond Jungles, interiors by Stephanie Harroch at XID. The project preserves the neighborhood’s historic character while elevating it with visionary design and lifestyle.

 The development features five individually designed estates, anchored by the historic Villa Prescott. Originally built in the 1920s, the Mediterranean Revival-style Prescott Mansion is an architectural jewel that will be meticulously rebuilt and elevated on a stone plinth, preserving its historic elements while meeting modern standards. Spanning 8,280 square feet with six bedrooms and seven-and-a-half baths, the estate will stand as the crown jewel of the community.

 Four additional contemporary residences will range from 4,711 to 7,621 square feet with four- to six-bedrooms. The bespoke homes are inspired by Mid-Century Modern design principles, featuring elevated structures, dramatic “floating” living rooms that extend over the water, and expansive glass walls framing unobstructed views of Biscayne Bay. Each waterfront home will feature a private bayfront pool, summer kitchen and direct yacht access. The residences offer a range of thoughtfully curated features and amenities including double-height grand rooms, timeless design with meticulous finishes, elevator, lounge area, private office, gourmet chef’s kitchen, and staff suite.
