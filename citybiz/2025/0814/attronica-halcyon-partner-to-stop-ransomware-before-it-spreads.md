# Attronica + Halcyon Partner to Stop Ransomware Before It Spreads

Every two seconds, a business falls victim to ransomware. Today, Attronica, a trusted technology partner for over 40 years, announced a new partnership with Halcyon, the only cybersecurity platform purpose-built to stop ransomware before, during, and after an attack.

 This collaboration brings Halcyon’s advanced ransomware defense — trusted by the Department of Defense and Fortune 500 companies — to Attronica’s nationwide client base. Businesses of all sizes can now access protection that not only blocks attacks but also recovers operations quickly and may help reduce cyber insurance premiums.

 Why This Partnership Matters

 Ransomware attacks are evolving faster than traditional defenses can keep up. Legacy tools may detect threats too late, and cyber insurance policies increasingly exclude ransomware coverage altogether. Businesses need a multi-layered defense that goes beyond standard antivirus or endpoint security.

 Inside the Halcyon Platform

 Halcyon combines:

 * Behavioral AI to detect suspicious activity in real time
* Decoys to lure and neutralize attackers before they reach real assets
* File rollback to restore compromised files instantly
* A Zero-Ransom Guarantee for qualifying customers

 When paired with Attronica’s hands-on support, businesses can deploy these capabilities faster, strengthen their security posture, and minimize downtime.

 Executive Perspective

 “Ransomware is moving too fast for legacy tools,” said Neil Thakkar, CEO of Attronica. “Our clients need immunity, not just cyber defense — and that’s what Halcyon delivers.”
