# Massachusetts-Based Advisor Joelle Spear Launches Independent Firm with Osaic

Osaic, Inc., one of the nation’s largest providers of wealth management strategies, announced today that Joelle Spear, CFP has joined its growing network of advisors. Formerly a partner and financial advisor at Canby Financial Advisors, an affiliate of Commonwealth, Spear is launching her independent firm, Spear Wealth Management. Based in Framingham, Massachusetts, the firm oversees approximately $170 million in assets under administration (AUA).

 Spear chose to affiliate with Osaic and join IFG, one of Osaic’s leading offices of supervisory jurisdiction (OSJs), after evaluating seven platforms. Her decision was guided by the strength of Osaic’s technology, as well as its deep bench of business and planning resources. She was also drawn to the people-first culture at IFG, exemplified by the firm’s commitment to letting agents chart their own path, its unparalleled support and superior client service.

 “Osaic stood out as the right home to embark upon this next chapter,” said Spear. “From the flexibility of their platform to the day-to-day operational support provided by IFG, I now have the time and resources to focus squarely on clients and the transitions that shape their financial lives.”

 A Certified Financial Planner® (CFP) professional with over two decades of experience, Spear specializes in working with clients navigating major life transitions, such as retirement, divorce or the loss of a loved one. She has a reputation for delivering thoughtful, long-term planning rooted in deep personal connection. Before launching her firm, Spear built a successful practice at Canby Financial Advisors, where she served a wide range of individuals, business owners, and families with customized financial advice.

Spear’s move to independence reflects a growing trend among advisors seeking autonomy and tailored support to grow their businesses. As founder, she joins a growing number of women advisors launching their own firms and credits the IFG team with making the process seamless.

 “Joelle is a dedicated, growth-minded advisor, committed to meaningful client relationships, who will thrive on the Osaic platform” said Kristen Kimmell, executive vice president of business development at Osaic. “We’re excited to support her vision as she continues to build Spear Wealth Management.”

 Spear Wealth Management joins a growing list of independent firms aligning with Osaic. Other recent additions include PATH Financial Partners, bringing specialized planning to Florida’s public sector employees; BlueHaven Wealth Management, a $400 million firm launched by veteran advisor Daniel Leugers; and Innovative Wealth, a $700 million team focused on succession planning in which Osaic made a strategic majority investment. These moves underscore Osaic’s continued momentum in attracting entrepreneurial advisors seeking flexibility, scale and support.
