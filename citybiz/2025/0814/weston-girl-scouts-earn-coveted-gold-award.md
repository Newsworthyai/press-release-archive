# Weston Girl Scouts Earn Coveted Gold Award

Girl Scouts recognized for creating lasting change in their communities

 Weston residents Sophia Diaz, Anneliese Hsiao, Valerie Niksa, Julie Saff and Victoria Valdivieso have each earned the coveted Girl Scout Gold Award, the highest and most prestigious recognition attainable by Girl Scout seniors and ambassadors in grades nine through 12. This award highlights the creative and impactful projects these young changemakers have developed to address real-world challenges in their communities.

 Sophia Diaz With the 50th anniversary of the iconic film, Jaws, set for this summer, Sophia Diaz’s project, “Shark-In-A-Box” was timely. To transform misconceptions about sharks, Sophia designed and distributed Shark-in-a-Box specialized educational kits with a comprehensive curriculum tailored to different grade levels, ensuring age-appropriate engagement. The lessons covered shark anatomy, their ecological significance, common myths and the real threats they face. The program’s impact was significant in that every participant reported gaining new knowledge and nearly half of those who initially feared sharks experienced a positive shift in perception.

 Anneliese Hsiao Anneliese Hsiao’s project, “South Florida Pet Safety,” addressed the unique dangers facing pets in South Florida including extreme heat, hurricanes, bufo toads and alligators, by creating a comprehensive pet safety book to educate and empower local pet owners. Noting a lack of resources available to pet owners, she conducted extensive research, reviewing more than 50 articles and consulting with such experts as Dr. Cynthia Rodgers from the Humane Society of Broward County to ensure the accuracy and practicality of her guide. Hsiao structured the book into four key chapters — heat, wildlife, plants, and natural disasters — offering practical advice on recognizing, preventing and responding to pet safety threats. Through her fundraising efforts, she printed 500 copies, 470 of which were donated to the Humane Society of Broward County to be distributed with pet adoptions. Hsiao also created a digital version to ensure long-term accessibility and partnered with local businesses such as veterinary clinics and pet-friendly hotels. Beyond her book, Hsiao founded a Pre-Vet Club at her school to inspire future careers in animal care. By February 2025, her project had reached more than 4,000 pet owners, creating lasting impact and ensuring better protection for pets throughout the region. In recognition of her efforts, she was also awarded the $1,500 Barbara Ann Turner “Service from the Heart” Scholarship presented to her during the Gold Award ceremony.

 Valerie Niksa Valerie Niksa’s project, “Looking Forward, Looking Back,” addressed the issue of declining self-esteem in young girls, particularly during their transition from elementary school to high school. According to the Girl Scouts of Florida State of the Florida Girl Report, 52% of Florida high school girls report feeling sad or hopeless for two or more weeks in a row. Studies indicate that between the tween and teen years, a young girl’s perception that others like them drops by nearly half, with many feeling pressured to be perfect in their appearance, academics and hobbies. To promote self-acceptance and resilience among girls at different stages of adolescence and remind girls of the confidence they often lose as they age, Niksa created a multi-faceted initiative. She produced an original video featuring high school and elementary school girls answering questions about their self-image, insecurities and happiness and organized a photoshoot that paired older girls with younger lookalikes, encouraging them to reconnect with their earlier sense of self-worth. The photos were compiled into a book with original text emphasizing the importance of self-acceptance and fun over perfection. The book has been distributed to schools across multiple states, and the video was featured at a prominent local event. Niksa’s project also included reflection exercises where participants responded to questions about their self-esteem.

 Julia Saff For her project, Julia Saff established the “Memory Lane Music Program,” an initiative that addresses the issue of loneliness and social isolation among elderly residents in nursing homes and care facilities. Recognizing that isolation in older adults is linked to serious health risks such as increased rates of depression, hospitalization and even early mortality, Saff set out to create meaningful connections through the power of music with her Gold Award project that provides free live music concerts for residents in nursing homes, assisted living centers and memory care facilities. The performances featured familiar and upbeat music to help alleviate loneliness, improve memory and encourage social engagement. Partnering with local musicians, including fellow high school students, Saff brought music directly to those who needed it most.

 Victoria Valdivieso Through her project, “Normalizing Medical Experiences for Children through Engaging Stories,” Victoria Valdivieso identified the fears and anxieties children experience when undergoing routine medical procedures. She identified a lack of engaging and reassuring resources available to young patients, which often led to heightened fear surrounding hospital visits. While pediatricians and child-life specialists work to alleviate these concerns, Valdivieso saw the need for a child-friendly educational tool that could help children feel more comfortable and informed about their medical experiences. Valdivieso wrote and illustrated a children’s book featuring animated animal characters who undergo common medical procedures such as getting an IV, having blood drawn and interacting with doctors and nurses. By using engaging storytelling and reassurance techniques recommended by a child-life specialist, her book helped young patients understand what to expect and ease their fears. She donated copies of her book to hospitals locally, nationally and internationally, including Holtz Children’s Hospital and medical centers in Peru. She also translated the book into Spanish to expand accessibility to a broader audience. For her impactful and creative work, Valdivieso was also awarded a Silver Knight Award in the English and Literature category by the Miami Herald.
