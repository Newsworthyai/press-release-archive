# Dog Park-Bar Hybrid Bark Social Reopens in Baltimore Under New Ownership

Bark Social, the dog-friendly beer garden and play space, is reopening its Baltimore location Thursday after a nine-month hiatus, now under the leadership of new owner Brad Notaro. The Canton resident acquired the brand’s Baltimore and Columbia, Md., sites earlier this year through We Love Pets which paid $500,000 for both. The Columbia location is slated to reopen this fall.

 The rebranded operation maintains its familiar open-air beer wall, “Bark Ranger” staff, and pet-friendly design, but has added new touches, including healthier menu options, dog-themed beverages, and upgraded dog suites for day campers. Notaro, 32, previously worked at cybersecurity company ZeroFox before deciding to take over the struggling chain. “It just seemed like the perfect opportunity — and less than five minutes from my house,” he said.

 Bark Social’s revival follows a turbulent period for the business. Founded in 2019 in Bethesda, Md., the company expanded rapidly to five locations across the Mid-Atlantic before filing for bankruptcy last November. Customers and staff were given little notice, memberships as high as $365 went unrefunded, and all locations were shuttered “until further notice.”

 Rumors of a revival began circulating earlier this year as locals spotted renovations at the Canton site. Roughly half of the reopened location’s staff are returnees from the pre-bankruptcy days, including new general manager Angelic Cruz, who previously served as assistant GM. “We are back, and we are better,” she said. “It was a family, a community here within Bark Social.”

 Pricing has shifted slightly under the new ownership. Entry remains free for humans, but annual dog memberships have risen from $365 to $385, monthly memberships from $40 to $45, and daily passes from $10 to $12. Notaro said the new rates were set after surveying former members during a series of soft-launch events this summer.

 Early turnout suggests the community is eager to return. “They couldn’t get into the gate quick enough,” Cruz said of opening events. “It felt good, like a homecoming.”
