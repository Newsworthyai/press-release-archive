# Disrupting the Desk and the Drink: Go Fund Yourself Episode 2 Spotlights KorTime and Smart Cups

On August 14, 2025, Cheddar TV’s Go Fund Yourself returns for Episode 2 of its third season, offering investors and entrepreneurs an inside look at two high-potential innovations poised to challenge massive industries.

 This week’s founders—Kory Segnit of KorTime and Chris Kanik of Smart Cups—brought more than just clever concepts to the stage. They brought scalable solutions targeting billion-dollar markets, backed by early traction, intellectual property, and strong value propositions for consumers and partners alike.

 

 KorTime: Capturing the Work-From-Anywhere Fitness Market

 With hybrid work now the norm, the demand for accessible wellness solutions is booming. Kory Segnit’s KorTime aims to capture that momentum with a patented resistance-band system that attaches to any desk, table, or countertop, enabling a full-body workout without leaving your workspace.

 Compact enough to fit in a desk drawer and priced under $100, the KorTime Pro Kit offers core, cardio, and strength exercises for busy professionals. Early reviews cite convenience, ease of use, and seamless integration into the workday as key selling points. The fitness equipment market is valued at more than $20 billion, and Segnit’s focus on the intersection of productivity and health positions KorTime to secure a competitive foothold in this growing segment.

 Smart Cups: Rethinking the Beverage Supply Chain

 In a world increasingly focused on sustainability and cost efficiency, Smart Cups delivers both. Founder Chris Kanik introduced a patented printed-beverage technology that transforms an empty cup into a ready-to-drink product—just add water.

 This innovation eliminates the need for liquid transport, cutting shipping volume and costs by up to 50%, according to early pilot programs. It also drastically reduces packaging waste, aligning with corporate ESG goals. With applications ranging from coffee and energy drinks to sticktails and nutritional supplements, Smart Cups is positioned to disrupt a $400 billion global market.

 The Titans Behind the Table

 One of the show’s core strengths is the caliber of its on-air decision-makers. Each week, founders pitch directly to three business heavyweights:

 * Rory Cutaia – Founder and creator of Go Fund Yourself, Cutaia is a seasoned entrepreneur and dealmaker. He brings deep expertise in scaling ventures and securing strategic capital.
* Jayson Waller – Award-winning founder, investor, and podcast host, known for building multi-million-dollar businesses from the ground up.
* David Meltzer – Chairman of the Napoleon Hill Institute, bestselling author, and globally recognized speaker who has advised and invested in hundreds of startups.

 For founders, access to these three titans means more than potential funding—it’s an opportunity to receive high-level mentorship, gain credibility, and open doors to partnerships.

 Why Go Fund Yourself Delivers Value Beyond the Stage

 Unlike traditional pitch shows, Go Fund Yourself integrates real-time audience engagement with actionable funding opportunities. Startups don’t just compete for the attention of the judges—they pitch to a national audience of viewers, investors, and industry leaders.

 The combination of media exposure, investor access, and business advisory from Cutaia, Waller, and Meltzer makes GFY a uniquely valuable platform for early-stage and growth-stage companies.
