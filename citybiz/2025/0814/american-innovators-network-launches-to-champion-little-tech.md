# American Innovators Network Launches to Champion Little Tech

Today, the American Innovators Network (AIN) launched as the alliance of advocates and builders solely committed to representing America’s Little Tech ecosystem—the startups, entrepreneurs, and risk-takers leading the next era of innovation and economic growth. Together with partners Andreessen Horowitz, Anyscale, Exowatt, Sourcegraph, Y Combinator, and a growing coalition of Little Tech companies, AIN is committed to advocating for forward-thinking regulations that foster industry growth and promote American innovation and competition.

 “Little Tech has always been—and will continue to be—the backbone of American greatness,” said Vanessa Day, Executive Director of AIN. “Our mission is not only urgent, but long overdue: to ensure that the next generation of entrepreneurs building AI startups will have a seat at the table and a voice to advocate for policies that will allow them to innovate, build, and disrupt.”

 “Andreessen Horowitz is on the side of Little Tech. For too long, startups and entrepreneurs have been shut out of the rooms where innovation policy gets made.” said Collin McCune, Head of Government Affairs for Andreessen Horowitz. “We’re excited to join the American Innovators Network alongside a growing coalition of startups and advocates to give Little Tech a voice and ensure the policy environment supports entrepreneurs’ ability to innovate and compete.”

 “We’re thrilled to be joining forces with other Little Tech champions to advocate for policies that allow early-stage companies to compete on a fair playing field,” said Luther Lowe, Head of Public Policy for Y Combinator. “Six or so huge companies can’t be the ones dictating policies in Washington and statehouses across the country. Little Tech needs a seat at the table.”

 AI will unlock countless good-paying American jobs and opportunities while simultaneously countering China’s attempts to control the next technological revolution. As a nation, it is imperative that we not only win the AI race, but dominate. Little Tech companies are poised to unleash AI’s significant opportunities across industries – from education, medicine, and healthcare to manufacturing and entertainment. AIN will advocate for policies that harness AI’s potential, prioritize American competitiveness, and allow Little Tech to flourish and succeed with a fair shot to compete on a level playing field.
