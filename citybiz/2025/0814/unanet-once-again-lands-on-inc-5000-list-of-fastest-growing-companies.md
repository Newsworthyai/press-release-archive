# Unanet Once Again Lands on Inc. 5000 List of Fastest-Growing Companies

For the eighth year in a row, Unanet, the leading provider of project-based enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) software for the government contracting (GovCon) and architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industries, has earned a spot on the prestigious Inc. 5000 list of the fastest-growing private companies in America. This award reflects Unanet’s continued momentum and the rising adoption of its modern, purpose-built solutions as more businesses upgrade away from outdated legacy software.

 “There is no comparison to our AI-enabled solutions, intuitive customer interface, or industry-leading customer support,” said Craig Halliday, CEO, Unanet. “In this dynamic and rapidly shifting marketplace, GovCon and AEC companies do not have the time or ability to reconfigure their entire business to implement an expensive, decades-old ERP or CRM solution with bolt-on upgrades. They need modern, scalable solutions that deliver fast results and real ROI. We’re proud of Unanet’s growth, and we have no plans to slow down.”

 The list provides a data-driven snapshot of the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Past honorees include companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Chobani, Under Armour, Timberland, Oracle, and Patagonia.

 This year’s Inc. 5000 honorees have demonstrated exceptional growth while navigating economic uncertainty, inflationary pressure, and a fluctuating labor market. Among the top 500 companies on the list, the median three-year revenue growth rate reached 1,552%. Additionally, those companies have collectively added more than 48,678 jobs to the U.S. economy over the past three years.

 “Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” says Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm—they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”

 Other Unanet honors for 2025 so far include ranking first for customer satisfaction and usability among mid-market ERP systems for project-based organizations In G2’s Spring 2025 Grid Report; earning two Gold Stevie® Awards in the 2025 American Business Awards® for its CRM GovCon solution; and, being recognized by CUSTOMER magazine with the prestigious CRM Excellence Award for the Unanet Growth Suite.
