# Palm Beach Gardens and Royal Palm Beach Girl Scouts Earn Coveted Gold Award

Girl Scouts recognized for creating lasting change in their communities

 Palm Beach Gardens residents Isabella Avallone and Marina DiMarzio and Royal Palm Beach resident Mailee Minitello have each earned the coveted Girl Scout Gold Award, the highest and most prestigious recognition attainable by Girl Scout seniors and ambassadors in grades nine through 12.This award highlights the creative and impactful projects these young changemakers have developed to address real-world challenges in their communities.

 Isabella Avallone, Palm Beach Gardens Isabella Avallone’s project, “Fix Her,” came about when she realized how many of her peers were unprepared for life after high school when it came to maintaining their own living spaces. Recognizing this practical knowledge gap and the broader gender gap in the construction industry, where only 10% of workers are women, Avallone developed a series of instructional videos covering basic tasks including painting, fixing toilets and changing smoke detectors to empower teen girls by teaching essential home repair skills to foster independence and gain confidence. She created the “Fix-Her” Instagram account, sharing tutorials and insights into careers in construction, and as a culminating activity, participants applied their new skills to build benches, which were donated to a local high school’s special needs department. Through Isabella’s online platform, future generations of girls can develop essential life skills and explore career opportunities in construction, breaking down barriers in a traditionally male-dominated field.

She wrote “What Happened to Grandma?,” a book designed to help children understand the changes brought on by Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. She explained the causes and symptoms of dementia in simple, age-appropriate terms and provided guidance on how children can maintain meaningful relationships with grandparents affected by the disease. Targeting children ages 9 to 11, DiMarzio distributed her book to libraries, schools and memory care facilities and expanded her reach with the book through sales on Amazon and a read-aloud video on YouTube. Pre- and post-surveys conducted with readers showed a significant increase in understanding, with knowledge improving from 45% to 77% on average. Her goal is to enlighten future generations, so they are more compassionate and better informed about the disease.

 Mailee Minitello, Royal Palm Beach Mailee Minitello’s project was the launch of “Mind Your Faith: Creating the Bridge from Struggle to Success,” a podcast and YouTube series addressing the growing mental health crisis among today’s youth. Recognizing the role of social media, pandemic isolation and societal pressures in contributing to issues such as anxiety, depression and eating disorders, Minitello created a faith-based platform where individuals could share their personal stories of overcoming adversity. Each weekly episode offers listeners support, hope and spiritual tools for healing. Her project provides an ongoing, accessible resource that empowers young people to take control of their mental well-being through faith.
