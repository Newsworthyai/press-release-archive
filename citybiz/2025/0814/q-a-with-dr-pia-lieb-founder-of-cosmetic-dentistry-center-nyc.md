# Q&amp;A with Dr. Pia Lieb, Founder of Cosmetic Dentistry Center NYC

Dr. Pia Lieb is an internationally celebrated cosmetic dentist renowned for creating some of the most natural, radiant, and camera-ready smiles in the world. With over 30 years of experience, her precision, artistic vision, and aesthetic instinct have made her the trusted expert for royalty, supermodels, Oscar-winning actors, musicians, CEOs, and discerning individuals who view their smile as their ultimate signature.

 Nicknamed the “Michelangelo of Dentistry,” Dr. Pia is revered for blending clinical excellence with an artist’s eye. Her Park Avenue practice, Cosmetic Dentistry Center NYC – Dr. Pia, is a by-referral-only destination for patients seeking discretion, innovation, and ultra-personalized care.

 You’re often called the “Michelangelo of Dentistry.” What does that title mean to you, and how does artistry play a role in your work?

 Being a general dentist or even a prosthodontist can become a purely mechanical profession if you lack the ability to see the artistic side of dentistry. My work demands the same principles a painter would consider: the patient’s facial proportions, harmony, and the precise balance of shape and size when designing porcelain restorations. It’s about mastering the nuances of size, contour, and color layering translucency, subtle shade variations, and surface texture so that the final result is indistinguishable from nature itself. Dentistry, in my hands, is as much sculpture as it is science.

 Your ultra-conservative, handcrafted veneer technique goes against the trend of aggressive filing and 3D printing. Why is preserving the natural tooth so important in your approach?

 The question I always ask is: Why would anyone choose to have their teeth shaved down when we can achieve a better, more natural result without sacrificing healthy enamel? My veneers are as thin as a natural fingernail and can transform a smile without irreversible damage. Once enamel is filed away, it never grows back. My philosophy is to maintain the full integrity of the tooth at all costs enhancing what nature gave you rather than erasing it.

 You’ve pioneered specialized treatments like Menopause Makeovers and Ozempic Smile Restorations. What inspired you to develop these offerings, and how have patients responded?

 The rise of Ozempic use has brought new oral health challenges. Many patients experience vomiting as a side effect, which accelerates enamel erosion and leads to sensitivity. My non-drilling porcelain veneer approach allows me to rebuild these teeth to their natural or even better state while preventing further wear.

 Menopause presents a different set of issues: reduced hormone levels lead to dry mouth, impairing saliva’s natural ability to neutralize acids, wash away bacteria, and aid remineralization. Gum recession also exposes sensitive root surfaces rich in nerve endings. By placing veneers directly over natural teeth without removing enamel, I can shield those roots, restore aesthetics, and dramatically reduce sensitivity. Patients are often shocked by how quickly comfort and confidence return.

 As someone trusted by celebrities, royalty, and CEOs, how do you ensure a discreet yet highly personalized experience for each patient?

 Privacy is non-negotiable. I only see one patient at a time. No two patients will meet in my office. Every appointment is designed around exclusivity, allowing me to focus entirely on that individual’s needs without distraction.

 After 18 years as a Clinical Assistant Professor at NYU and now as Professor Emerita, how has teaching shaped your perspective on dentistry and innovation?

 Teaching at NYU kept me on the cutting edge of research, techniques, and technology. It reinforced that dentistry must constantly evolve but without losing sight of the fundamentals of preservation, precision, and artistry. Innovation should serve the patient’s long-term health, not just the industry’s desire for speed or convenience.

 What are the most exciting advancements in cosmetic dentistry today, and where do you see the field heading in the next decade?

 Thankfully, we’re seeing a return to the natural look. The over bleached “Hollywood smile,” oversized opaque veneers, and overfilled lips are on their way out just like “Spock” brows from overuse of neurotoxins. The next decade will be about creating the best version of yourself bespoke, individual, and timeless. Each smile will be custom crafted for the person, not 3D-printed in a one-size-fits-all template.

 Your Park Avenue practice is known for being both luxurious and patient first. How do you balance the science, artistry, and emotional aspects of creating a life-changing smile?

 It begins with listening. My consultations last a minimum of one hour, because communication is everything you need to fully understand each patient’s desires, insecurities, and vision. Then I apply The Dr. Pia Method: a handcrafted, temporary smile placed directly over the patient’s existing teeth. Instead of showing a 2D rendering, I give them a live 3D preview—like trying on a new hairstyle or wearing a wig for a few days. This lets them feel the change, test it in real life, and give feedback before the final work begins. The result is a smile that isn’t just beautiful, it’s deeply personal and exactly what they dreamed of.
