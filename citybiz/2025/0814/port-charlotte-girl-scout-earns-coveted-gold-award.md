# Port Charlotte Girl Scout Earns Coveted Gold Award

Girl Scout recognized for creating lasting change in her community

 Port Charlotte resident Hannah Dickinson has earned the coveted Girl Scout Gold Award, the highest and most prestigious recognition attainable by Girl Scout seniors and ambassadors in grades nine through 12. This award highlights the creative and impactful projects these young changemakers have developed to address real-world challenges in their communities.

 For her Gold Award project, “Kindness Counts,” Dickinson tackled the issue of bullying and negativity in school bathrooms, spaces often marked by hurtful graffiti and derogatory messages that contributed to anxiety, low self-esteem and an unwelcoming environment for students. According to the State of the Florida Girl report, 52% of Florida high school girls report feeling sad or hopeless for two or more weeks in a row and 1 in 4 girls seriously considered attempting suicide, showing a troubling rise of more than 60% in the last 10 years. Additionally, one in eight girls miss school due to feeling unsafe, with girls being one and a half times more likely than boys to stay home after experiencing bullying. One in eight girls miss school due to feeling unsafe, with girls being one and a half times more likely than boys to stay home after experiencing bullying. Determined to transform these areas into safe, encouraging spaces, Dickinson collaborated with school administrators, counselors and custodial staff to remove harmful markings and replace them with colorful murals promoting kindness and self-worth.

 To further build a culture of compassion, Dickinson introduced a “positivity wall” where students could post uplifting notes and messages of support to one another. The initiative quickly became a centerpiece of the school’s efforts to combat bullying and reinforce positive peer interactions. Through her role as a peer mentor, she also facilitated discussions on the impact of words and the importance of empathy. Dickinson extended her project’s reach by partnering with the district’s strategic planning committee, allowing her message to influence other schools in the area.

 “We are so proud of all of our Gold Award Girl Scouts whose projects are insightful, impactful and relevant,” said Lisa Johnson, CEO of Girl Scouts of Southeast Florida. “With their projects, these young ladies tackle some of today’s most pressing challenges with compassion, innovation, and leadership. They are change agents that are making a true impact in their communities and beyond.”

 This Girl Scout was among 27 young female leaders in the region to earn the Gold Award during the 2025 Annual Gold Award Ceremony, with sponsorship support from Amazon, Fiserv, Florida Power & Light, Great Charity Challenge, HCA Florida Healthcare, and Publix Super Market Charities.
