# YogaSix Bentonville to Host “Back to School, Back to Routine” Event August 15–17

YogaSix, a modern fitness boutique offering a fresh take on one of the world’s oldest practices, will host a “Back to School, Back to Routine” event at its Bentonville studio (1110 SE 28th St, Suite 20) from August 15 to 17. To thank the community, teachers, and school staff for their support and to celebrate the new school year, the three-day event will feature free classes all weekend, Lala Links Permanent Jewelry offering bracelets, necklaces, and rings, and Woodhouse Spa Rogers providing chair massages before or after class.

 Having served the community for over a year, the studio provides members with a spa-like, welcoming environment to experience the health and wellness benefits of yoga.

 YogaSix Bentonville is owned and operated by Gracie Lively, a local entrepreneur, marketing professional, and mother of three who was born and raised in Northwest Arkansas. When exploring business opportunities, Lively knew she wanted to bring something to her hometown that was inclusive, accessible, and genuinely impactful. Though not a yogi by trade, she saw YogaSix as the perfect fit – a modern, approachable take on yoga designed for every body and experience level.

 With young kids of her own, Lively understands how hard it can be for parents to carve out time for themselves. YogaSix offers a space to unwind, recharge, and enjoy an hour of self-care, which inspired the upcoming “Back to School, Back to Routine” event.

 “Back to school is such a chaotic time for both kids and parents, and it’s harder than ever for moms to find time for themselves,” said Lively. “That’s really what inspired this event – to give parents and teachers a chance to decompress, move their bodies, and connect with others through our group classes. We’re hoping to see a strong turnout of people who just need a break from the back-to-school rush.”

 A variety of yoga classes are offered at YogaSix to encompass everything from deep stretching, to stress relief, to cardio and strength. Offering 7 core formats: TRX, Y6 Mobility, Y6 Restore, Y6 Slow Flow, Y6 Hot, Y6 Power and Y6 Sculpt & Flow, each class caters to every fitness level and strengthens the mind-body connection.

 The studio has already left a strong impression on the Bentonville community over the last year with its unique, modern version of yoga and full sensory experience featuring a state-of-the-art heating system, sound and lights, high-quality cushioned performance flooring, cool eucalyptus towels, aroma-therapy, and a chic retail boutique featuring high quality apparel, yoga mats, towels and more.

 Particularly notable is the use of modern language instead of Sanskrit to describe poses, as the traditional language can be intimidating to newcomers. The studio provides class options for everybody, from beginners to athletes seeking recovery to more advanced students, in a judgement-free, welcoming, and supportive environment. New students are always greeted by a wellness advisor when they enter the studio to educate and empower them before they engage in a YogaSix experience.

 YogaSix Bentonville is open Monday through Thursday from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., Saturday from 7:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., and Sunday from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Monthly memberships are available for four, eight or unlimited visits per month, as well as drop-in options. More information about the new studio can be found at www.yogasix.com and the studio can be contacted by email at bentonville@yogasix.com, or by phone at (479) 364-0298.
