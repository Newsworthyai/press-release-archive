# Fort Lauderdale Girl Scout Earns Coveted Gold Award

Award recognizes projects resulting in lasting change in local communities

 Fort Lauderdale resident Lilly Gonzalez has earned the coveted Girl Scout Gold Award, the highest and most prestigious recognition attainable by Girl Scout seniors and ambassadors in grades nine through 12. This award highlights the creative and impactful projects these young changemakers have developed to address real-world challenges in their communities.

 For her project “Garden of Growth,” Gonzalez addressed the critical issue of food waste and its far-reaching environmental, economic and social consequences. She identified several contributing factors, including consumer confusion about expiration dates, the rejection of imperfect produce and waste generated by restaurants and supermarkets. To address these issues, she built a self-sustaining compost bin at First Presbyterian Church in downtown Fort Lauderdale and led interactive workshops for more than 90 preschoolers, church members and event organizers. Using engaging children’s books, compost-themed activities and hands-on “compost cups,” she helped participants understand how composting can reduce waste and enrich the soil. In addition, Gonzalez trained kitchen volunteers in composting practices and implemented a system for donating excess food to a local soup kitchen. To ensure her project’s lasting impact, she developed an educational composting guide, established a team of trained volunteers and partnered with Feeding South Florida to promote ongoing food redistribution.

 “We are so proud of all of our Gold Award Girl Scouts whose projects are insightful, impactful and relevant,” said Lisa Johnson, CEO of Girl Scouts of Southeast Florida. “With their projects, these young ladies tackle some of today’s most pressing challenges with compassion, innovation, and leadership. They are change agents that are making a true impact in their communities and beyond.”

 This Girl Scout was among 27 young female leaders in the region to earn the Gold Award during the 2025 Annual Gold Award Ceremony, with sponsorship support from Amazon, Fiserv, Florida Power & Light, Great Charity Challenge, HCA Florida Healthcare, and Publix Super Market Charities.
