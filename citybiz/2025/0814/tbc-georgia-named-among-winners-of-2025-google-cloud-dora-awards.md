# TBC Georgia Named Among Winners of 2025 Google Cloud DORA Awards

TBC Bank, the leading financial institution in Georgia and the South Caucasus region and part of London-listed TBC Bank Group, announces today that it has been recognized by the Google Cloud DORA Awards for its continued global tech leadership.

 TBC Bank, which has a dominant market position in Georgia with an almost 40% share of loans and deposits, was crowned the winner in the “Loosely Coupled Teams” category, one of DORA’s most critical focus areas. Winning this award highlights TBC’s continued excellence in building high-performing teams that work independently, can deploy, test and change code or infrastructure autonomously and that collaborate effectively without being blocked by other departments or approvals.

 The DORA Awards are Google Cloud’s most expansive, long-running research-based recognition program, assessing what truly fuels software delivery and operational performance. This recognition by Google underscores the best-in-class nature of TBC’s team structure, tech infrastructure and software architecture, while affirming the Bank’s continued commitment to aligning with DevOps best practices.

 TBC Bank is part of London-listed TBC Bank Group, a leading provider of tech-enabled modern financial services in Central Asia and the Caucasus. In addition to TBC Bank in Georgia, the Group operates TBC Uzbekistan, the leading digital banking ecosystem in Central Asia with 21 million users.

 Bidzina Matsaberidze, TBC Bank CIO: “As the country’s largest fintech company, our goal is to use technology to craft accessible, hassle-free products and services for our users. We are always striving to be more effective and move faster, which is why we invest heavily in both tech health and organization design. We are honoured to be recognized by Google’s DORA Awards – our inclusion in this key global benchmark confirms the effectiveness of our approach and highlights our continued tech leadership in Georgia and beyond”

 Giga Shubitidze, TBC Bank SDLC Governance Lead: “This award affirms our recent strategic transformation, which has seen us make significant strides in increasing the effectiveness of our tech infrastructure and teams. We have accelerated how quickly new features reach users by introducing product-aligned teams, minimized inter-team dependencies, modernized monolithic systems into microservices, automated infrastructure provisioning and CI/CD entirely, launched real-time monitoring and alert systems, and cultivated a strong DevOps culture. As a result, we have shortened software delivery time from months to days and boosted deployment frequency by over 600%. This recognition from Google provides us with immense motivation to continue evolving and delivering faster, more reliable, and innovative digital services to our users.”
