# Ace Pickleball Club Serves Up Its First Kansas Location, Ushering in a New Era of Social Fitness

Ace Pickleball Club (APC), a rapidly expanding national pickleball franchise with a community-based approach, is excited to open its first Kansas location in Olathe at 1445 S. Mahaffie Street. The Club is set to officially open on August 30 and will bring together community and competition to meet the growing local demand for pickleball.

 APC Olathe is owned and operated by longtime friends and pickleball enthusiasts Alex McCarty and Mitch Morse, both of whom graduated from the University of Missouri in 2016. After college, McCarty joined the Peace Corps in Panama, working with a farmers’ cooperative for two years. Meanwhile, Morse pursued a career in finance, specializing in taxes, mergers, and acquisitions. In 2018, seeking a new challenge, they co-founded Premium Outdoor Grills, an online store offering high-quality grills, grill parts, heaters, and patio accessories

 After trying pickleball for the first time, the duo quickly saw the sport’s wide appeal, attracting players of all ages and skill levels. Realizing a gap in their hometown, McCarty and Morse decided to expand their business portfolio. They saw that Olathe lacked a dedicated pickleball space where players could enjoy the game on their own time in a controlled environment. With pickleball growing rapidly in the community, they knew it was the perfect moment to bring an Ace Pickleball Club to Olathe.

 “What drew us to Ace Pickleball Club was the focus on community and accessibility,” said McCarty. “We knew Olathe needed a space where people could play every day, meet others who love the game, and truly feel part of something.

 APC offers Members hassle-free flexibility through a single monthly membership that allows for unlimited, all-day play on professional-grade courts. The state-of-the-art facilities offer climate-controlled conditions and designated courts for beginners, intermediate, and advanced players, making it optimal for all skill levels and ages.

 To show our appreciation for the Olathe community, Ace Pickleball Club Olathe is excited to offer 30 days of free Membership starting from the day the new Club opens on August 30.
