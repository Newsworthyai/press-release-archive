# Boca Raton and Delray Beach Girl Scouts Earn Coveted Gold Award

Girl Scouts recognized for creating lasting change in their communities

 Boca Raton resident Lilly Nguyen and Delray Beach resident Ronica Deshmukh each earned the coveted Girl Scout Gold Award, the highest and most prestigious recognition attainable by Girl Scout seniors and ambassadors in grades nine through 12. This award highlights the creative and impactful projects these young changemakers have developed to address real-world challenges in their communities.

 Lilly Nguyen, Boca Raton Nguyen’s project, “Heart to Heart,” addressed the life-threatening realities of heart disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S. With cardiac arrest claiming hundreds of thousands of lives annually, Nguyen focused on the importance of CPR education as a vital, yet often inaccessible, life-saving skill. She discovered that many individuals lacked proper training or confidence due to financial and informational barriers. As a certified CPR instructor, Nguyen provided free hands-on training to high school students and community members in public spaces, including schools and libraries, equipping them with both the knowledge and confidence to act in emergencies. To extend the reach of her work, Nguyen developed a website and social media platforms that featured CPR tutorials, music-based pacing guides and heart health tips. She also trained future instructors to ensure the classes would continue beyond her direct involvement.

 Ronica Deshmukh, Delray Beach For her project, Deshmukh focused on “Shattering Stereotypes: Empowering Asian Voices in Media.” Recognizing how the media shapes identity and aspirations, particularly among the younger generation, Deshmukh sought to challenge cultural expectations and amplify diverse Asian voices in creative industries often overshadowed by traditional career paths. She interviewed successful Asian professionals in media, including actors, journalists and artists, most notably Rushi Kota, known for his role in Netflix’s “Never Have I Ever.” These interviews highlighted the challenges of typecasting and the need for authentic representation. By sharing these stories through social media, Deshmukh ignited conversations around visibility, breaking cultural norms and pursuing creative passions. Her YouTube channel continues to inspire viewers, encouraging future generations to see themselves not just in the story, but as lead characters. In recognition of her impactful work, Deshmukh was also awarded the inaugural $2,500 GSSEF Board of Directors Gold Award Scholarship.
