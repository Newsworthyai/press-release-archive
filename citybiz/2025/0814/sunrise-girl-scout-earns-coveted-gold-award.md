# Sunrise Girl Scout Earns Coveted Gold Award

Award recognizes projects resulting in lasting change in local communities

 Sunrise resident Amelie Prodhomme has earned the coveted Girl Scout Gold Award, the highest and most prestigious recognition attainable by Girl Scout seniors and ambassadors in grades nine through 12. This award highlights the creative and impactful projects these young changemakers have developed to address real-world challenges in their communities.

 Prodhomme’s Gold Award project, “Girls on the Go: Helping Teen Girls Navigate Car Care with Confidence,” tackled the widespread lack of car care knowledge among teen girls, a gap she noticed firsthand through her sister Elisa’s reliance on their father for vehicle-related issues. To address this, Prodhomme created a comprehensive car care education program designed specifically for teen girls. She hosted hands-on workshops and developed an easy-to-follow pamphlet outlining essential car maintenance tasks, from checking tire pressure to responding to a flat tire or minor accident. The pamphlet included a QR code linking to instructional videos she created, allowing for visual, on-the-go learning. Prodhomme also launched a YouTube channel and promoted her content on social media, providing an ongoing, accessible resource for teen drivers.

 “We are so proud of all of our Gold Award Girl Scouts whose projects are insightful, impactful and relevant,” said Lisa Johnson, CEO of Girl Scouts of Southeast Florida. “With their projects, these young ladies tackle some of today’s most pressing challenges with compassion, innovation, and leadership. They are change agents that are making a true impact in their communities and beyond.”

 This Girl Scout was among 27 young female leaders in the region to earn the Gold Award during the 2025 Annual Gold Award Ceremony, with sponsorship support from Amazon, Fiserv, Florida Power & Light, Great Charity Challenge, HCA Florida Healthcare, and Publix Super Market Charities.
