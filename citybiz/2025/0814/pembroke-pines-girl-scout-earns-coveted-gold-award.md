# Pembroke Pines Girl Scout Earns Coveted Gold Award

Award recognizes projects resulting in lasting change in local communities

 Pembroke Pines resident Elise Schaub has earned the coveted Girl Scout Gold Award, the highest and most prestigious recognition attainable by Girl Scout seniors and ambassadors in grades nine through 12. This award highlights the creative and impactful projects these young changemakers have developed to address real-world challenges in their communities.

 Recognizing a critical need at Pines Middle School, Schaub launched “Building the Future Through STEM,” a project to encourage student engagement and prevent the school from closing due to declining enrollment. According to the State of the Florida Girl report, fewer girls are entering STEM fields, although women make up 52% of Florida’s college-educated population, only 32% pursue careers in science or engineering, underscoring the need to spark interest early. By establishing a robotics team, she sparked a new interest in STEM education and created a space where students could build skills in collaboration, problem-solving and critical thinking. Her initiative became a key factor in the school remaining open and laid the foundation for its potential transformation into a Collegiate Academy.

 Under Schaub’s leadership, the robotics team competed in the First Lego League (FLL), where students tackled real-world challenges such as deep-sea exploration using underwater drone technology. In addition to the competition, Schaub hosted workshops that introduced students to STEM careers, from biomedical research to nuclear engineering, broadening their aspirations and building excitement around science and technology.

 Schaub’s project has had a lasting impact, inspiring the formation of additional STEM-focused programs such as VEX Robotics and Sea Perch. These clubs continue to thrive, providing students with hands-on learning opportunities and exposure to in-demand fields. Her work has helped transform the academic environment at Pines Middle, ensuring students are not only excited about learning, but also better prepared for the future.

 “We are so proud of all of our Gold Award Girl Scouts whose projects are insightful, impactful and relevant,” said Lisa Johnson, CEO of Girl Scouts of Southeast Florida. “With their projects, these young ladies tackle some of today’s most pressing challenges with compassion, innovation, and leadership. They are change agents that are making a true impact in their communities and beyond.”

 This Girl Scout was among 27 young female leaders in the region to earn the Gold Award during the 2025 Annual Gold Award Ceremony, with sponsorship support from Amazon, Fiserv, Florida Power & Light, Great Charity Challenge, HCA Florida Healthcare, and Publix Super Market Charities.
