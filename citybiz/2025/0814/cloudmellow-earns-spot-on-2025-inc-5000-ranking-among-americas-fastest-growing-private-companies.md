Inc., the leading media brand and playbook for the entrepreneurs and business leaders shaping our future, today announced that CloudMellow has been named to the 2025 Inc. 5000 list, ranking among America’s fastest-growing private companies. This recognition marks CloudMellow’s third appearance on the prestigious list, with an impressive 222% three-year revenue growth.

 The Inc. 5000 list offers a data-driven look at the most successful independent businesses across the U.S. economy. Many household names — including Microsoft, Meta, Chobani, Under Armour, and Patagonia — first gained national attention as Inc. 5000 honorees.

Our B2B expertise, agility and commitment to being a trusted advisor have allowed us to build long-term partnerships that fuel sustainable growth for our clients and for CloudMellow. This third appearance on the Inc. 5000 list reflects not just our momentum, but our mission to help brands stay ahead in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.”
