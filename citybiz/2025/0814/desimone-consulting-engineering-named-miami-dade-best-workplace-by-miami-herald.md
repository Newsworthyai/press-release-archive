# DeSimone Consulting Engineering Named Miami-Dade Best Workplace by Miami Herald

Recognition adds to firms growing list of top workplace honors globally

 DeSimone Consulting Engineering has been named one of Miami-Dade’s 2025 Best Workplaces by the Miami Herald, expanding a list of best workplace honors that includes USA Today, Crain’s New York, amNYmetro, and The Sunday Times of London. This latest honor reflects the strength of its workplace culture, which fuels the firm’s impact in engineering excellence across the globe.

 The Miami Herald partners with Best Companies Group (BCG) to identify the region’s top workplaces through a dual‑track process through which companies self-report their culture and policies and employees share their workplace experiences through a robust survey. BCG benchmarks the results to rank and recognize outstanding employers.

 At the heart of the recognition are the voices of DeSimone’s Miami-based staff, who gave the company exceptional scores in categories that speak directly to employee well-being, long-term commitment, and job satisfaction.

 “Since opening our Miami office in 1975, we’ve been incredibly proud of the contributions that our engineers have made to the skyline of South Florida,” said Stephen V. DeSimone, PE, Chairman and CEO of DeSimone Consulting Engineering. “We support the excellence, professional development, and well-being of our team through the work environment we create, and we’re humbled by their appreciation and respect in earning DeSimone the honor of being named a Miami Herald Best Workplace.”

 Of the DeSimone Miami staff polled, 93% indicated they enjoy their work. Nearly 90% reported a strong sense of meaning and purpose in their work, with a majority expressing that they feel part of a team working toward shared goals. DeSimone teammates also gave company supervisors and leaders high marks for treating them with respect and encouraging and supporting staff at all levels to develop professionally.

 Led by Managing Principals William O’Donnell, PE, and Luis Ramirez, PE, SECB, DeSimone’s Miami team has lent its structural engineering and façade and building envelope expertise to some of Florida’s most innovative, high-profile, and challenging developments. These include the award-winning MSC Cruises Terminal in PortMiami and the Aston Martin Residences—a luxury waterfront tower that marks the auto company’s first expansion into branded residences.

 The DeSimone team is currently providing structural design and façade and building envelope consulting for the nearly complete Osvaldo N. Soto Miami-Dade Justice Center in Miami, as well as structural design for Broward County Convention Center Hotel and Expansion, with the hotel slated to open in 2026.

 Having completed over 13,000 projects in some 60 countries around the world, DeSimone is committed to providing work-life balance and growth opportunities, cultivating a world-class environment where its talent is empowered to deliver superior work to clients.
