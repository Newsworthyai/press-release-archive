# CUDDLY Debuts East Coast Rescue Rover, in Operation with New York City Second Chance Rescue, to Save Animals from Overcrowded Shelters

The for-good animal welfare organization will utilize the new transport van to relocate vulnerable animals at risk of euthanasia

 CUDDLY®, a mission-driven company dedicated to supporting animal welfare organizations through innovative fundraising tools and a pet food line that gives back to shelters and rescues with every purchase, announced the launch of its East Coast CUDDLY® Rescue Rover van. In collaboration with New York City Second Chance Rescue (NYCSCR)—an organization that proudly feeds its animals CUDDLY® Food–CUDDLY has launched the second Rescue Rover in its growing fleet of vans. The East Coast CUDDLY Rescue Rover seeks to save vulnerable shelter animals across the New York metro area and play a key role in addressing critical animal shelter congestion.

 CUDDLY’s Rescue Rover is a transport vehicle for shelter animals who are at the highest risk, bringing them from overwhelmed shelters to rescues with more space and resources to deliver essential care. Funded by CUDDLY’s do-good subscription program, CUDDLY Club, the Rescue Rover will be based in NYC and operated by NYCSCR to transport animals from overcrowded New York City shelters in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn, and transport them to NYCSCR’s new rescue center location in Long Island City. The CUDDLY Club pools together monthly or one-time donations to make a bigger impact, such as sending supplies directly to shelters in need or funding a new Rescue Rover.

 The new Rescue Rover will support efforts to alleviate congested animal shelters in NYC, which receive an influx of animals due to summer heat, summer vacations, hurricane season, and other factors that drive the rate of pet surrenders and strays on city streets. On September 6th, CUDDLY and NYCSCR will debut the Rescue Rover in NYC with a special welcome party for dogs being pulled from the local shelter. The mission will bring adoptable pups to safety—and straight into a celebration filled with treats, photo ops, and new beginnings.

 “Our Rescue Rover initiative makes it more accessible to save the growing number of shelter animals at risk of euthanasia, and give them a fighting chance to find their forever families,” said Amy Peterson, Director of Event Marketing at CUDDLY. “Partnering with New York City Second Chance Rescue has allowed us to have an even more hands-on approach to helping struggling NYC animal shelters and make a true community impact.”

 “CUDDLY’s new Rescue Rover aligns seamlessly with our mission by helping us rescue and rehabilitate animals at risk in overcapacity shelters, adding to the 16,000+ lives saved since our founding in 2009,” said Jennifer Brooks, President and Founder of NYC Second Chance Rescue. “These animals matter, and working together with CUDDLY will help as many animals as possible get their second chance at a life beyond the shelters.”

 CUDDLY launched its first Rescue Rover in Austin, TX, in 2022, in partnership with Austin Pets Alive!, to rescue animals through relocation and transport those animals in urgent need of help outside of Texas to save more lives. The company is now expanding its Rescue Rover initiative to NYC, with plans to introduce a third van later this year.
