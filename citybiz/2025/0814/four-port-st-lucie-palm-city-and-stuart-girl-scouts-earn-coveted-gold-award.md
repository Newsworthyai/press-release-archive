# Four Port St. Lucie, Palm City and Stuart Girl Scouts Earn Coveted Gold Award

Girl Scouts recognized for creating lasting change in their communities

 Port St. Lucie residents Autumn Wilson and Michelle Donohue, Palm City resident Ruby Miller and Stuart resident Hannah Stefanovic have each earned the coveted Girl Scout Gold Award, the highest and most prestigious recognition attainable by Girl Scout seniors and ambassadors in grades nine through 12. This award highlights the creative and impactful projects these young changemakers have developed to address real-world challenges in their communities.

 Autumn Wilson, Port St. Lucie For her project, “Safe Aquatics for Everyone,” Autumn Wilson focused on drowning prevention by increasing water safety education and awareness. Wilson hosted a Water Safety Expo, gathering experts including lifeguards, swim instructors and pool safety professionals to provide hands-on information and demonstrations. With sponsorship from the city manager of Fort Pierce, she secured a venue and distributed goody bags packed with resources to families. Her outreach extended to local organizations including Children’s Services Council and Boys and Girls Club, where she shared educational handouts and interactive coloring pages to engage children in learning about water safety. To ensure long-term impact, Wilson partnered with local libraries and nonprofits to host readings of “Stewie the Duck Learns to Swim,” further reinforcing drowning prevention strategies.

With the decline of traditional educational courses such as home economics and financial literacy, Donohue identified a need for accessible, real-world knowledge on topics including home maintenance, automotive care and budgeting. She created a free, comprehensive website to serve as a digital learning hub for essential life skills and included additional resources for users to deepen their knowledge and improve their preparedness for adulthood. The site reached more than 100 users and received positive feedback from young people eager to gain independence and confidence. With ongoing updates, Donohue’s platform remains a relevant resource that empowers the next generation with practical tools for navigating daily life.

 Ruby Miller, Palm City Ruby Miller’s project, “Gardening for Good,” combined sustainability and service to address food insecurity in her community. She transformed a neglected garden space at the Immanuel Lutheran Church soup kitchen into a thriving source of fresh herbs and vegetables. Leading 20 volunteers, Miller rebuilt garden beds, installed irrigation and planted a variety of crops to enhance the nutritional quality of meals served to those in need. The garden also became a hub for education and camaraderie, with Miller organizing tours and sessions to raise awareness about food justice and sustainability. By inviting soup kitchen guests to participate in maintaining the garden, she fostered empowerment and community engagement. The church has committed to continuing the project, ensuring the impact grows along with the garden.

 Hannah Stefanovic, Stuart Hannah Stefanovic sought to raise awareness about how everyday human behaviors affect Florida’s waterways with her project, “Marine Education to Improve Our Florida Waterways.” Concerned by the deterioration of waterways and its impact on marine life including manatees and seagrasses, she launched an educational campaign combining digital resources and physical signage. Working with environmental experts, she developed a website and installed QR-coded signs at the U.S. Sailing Center to offer guidance on sustainable boating, pollution prevention and marine safety. Her outreach helped more than 100 individuals make informed choices to protect waterways, and her project inspired the addition of a new map at the Sailing Center to guide boaters through environmentally sensitive areas. Through her efforts, Stefanovic has sparked a culture of environmental responsibility and left behind a lasting toolset for preserving Florida’s aquatic ecosystems.
