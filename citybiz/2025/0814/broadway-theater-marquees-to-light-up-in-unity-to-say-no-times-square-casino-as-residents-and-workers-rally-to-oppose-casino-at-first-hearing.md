# Broadway Theater Marquees to Light Up in Unity to Say “No Times Square Casino” as Residents and Workers Rally to Oppose Casino at First Hearing

Photos and videos of 16 theatre marquees lit up in solidarity with the Broadway community’s opposition to the casino can be seen here.

 People from across the theater community, neighbors and local non-profit organizations gathered and rallied Wednesday, August 13 at 9am to oppose plans for developer SL Green’s casino that promises to hurt Broadway and the economic activity it supports, prey on vulnerable New Yorkers and generate fresh quality of life problems for residents.

 In solidarity with the Broadway Community’s opposition to the casino, Times Square billboards and marquees at 16 Broadway theatres including the Majestic, the Palace, the Samuel J Friedman and the St. James lit up with the “No Times Square Casino” message from 8:00-10:30am and from 4:00-5:30pm Wednesday urging members of the public to visit NoTimesSquareCasino.com to contact their local elected officials and voice their concern about the proposal.

 The rally and marquee action come as the Community Advisory Committee (CAC) for the Times Square proposal holds its first public hearing Wednesday, where the 71 percent of the community opposing the casino will have its first chance to be heard by the people deciding the project’s future.

 What: Rally to OPPOSE a Times Square casino before public hearing

 When: Wednesday, August 13, 9am

 Where: Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets, Manhattan (location of the public hearing, which begins at 10am)

 Who: Dozens of residents, Broadway union members and other members of the No Times Square Casino Coalition

 The Times Square casino proposal has generated massive opposition, with 71 percent of Midtown residents opposed in a recent Tulchin Research poll. The grassroots coalition of opponents to the casino has grown to 35 organizations, including IATSE—the largest union on Broadway representing 7 locals and 168,000 workers across North America— the United Federation of Teachers, social service providers like the Ali Forney Center and Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, as well as resident groups like the Hell’s Kitchen Neighborhood Association and Westside Neighborhood Alliance. Broadway’s recent record-breaking season is further evidence that the pandemic-era casino proposal is out of touch with the neighborhood and its resurgence
