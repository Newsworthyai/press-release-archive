# Q&amp;A with Graham Beasely, COO, Arcitecta: Simplifying Data Management to Drive Innovation and Value

Graham Beasley is the COO of Arcitecta, Inc. Graham brings more than 30 years of experience and a degree in Computer Science to his role. Prior to joining Arcitecta in 2015, Graham held engineering and management roles in Computer hardware, software, and services companies. He worked at SGI (Silicon Graphics Inc.) where he received two patents for innovative work in computer graphics. He has also worked in the Defence and Intelligence areas specializing in satellite imagery. In this area, Graham worked closely with customers collecting and processing satellite data, creating down-stream product and disseminating it to the user community. These areas continue to push the envelope in terms of the processing and management of “Big Data”.

 Arcitecta’s core product, Mediaflux, is built to simplify complexity. Where other solutions require stitching together multiple tools for storage, metadata, movement, security, and automation, Mediaflux does it all in one platform.

 Graham has a passion for metadata and its use in simplifying and exploiting the use and re-use of big datasets. He enjoys travel for business and leisure and meeting customers worldwide and learning from their specific use cases.

 Tell us a little bit about yourself and your background – and what drew you to Arcitecta.

 My major in college was Computer Science in the 1980’s and I worked as a software engineer for about 20 years before moving into management with increasing levels of responsibility. Denver is the world’s leading area for commercial satellite imagery, so I moved here from Silicon Valley in 2000 to work in the industry. One of the challenges the industry faces is managing the tremendous amounts of data these satellites create. In 2014, Arcitecta, a company based in Melbourne Australia, was starting a contract managing data for Longmont-based DigitalGlobe and I came on board as a consultant to support that effort. What immediately drew me to Arcitecta was their innovative approach to data management, something I recognized had the potential to be applicable to many industries in addition to satellite imagery. That realization let me to become their first U.S. employee, and we went on to found Arcitecta, Inc., the U.S. subsidiary, which I still manage today.

 It’s clear that data is the lifeblood of modern organizations. What are the biggest data management challenges faced by these organizations today?

 Organizations today are drowning in data, often spread across silos, clouds, and geographies. Managing this sprawl while keeping data discoverable, secure, and cost-effective is a growing challenge. In addition, as data sprawls many teams lack visibility into what data they have, where it resides, and how it’s being used. That’s not all, storage costs are climbing as redundant or obsolete data accumulates. Compliance and changing privacy laws add pressure and complexity to managing and safeguarding an organization’s data holdings. Ultimately, the biggest challenge is not just storing data—it’s turning it into a governed, accessible, and trusted asset that can drive innovation and increase the wealth of an organization versus a liability where an organization can’t find the data or it falls into the wrong hands.

 Data management in today’s world is a complex challenge. How does Arcitecta set itself apart?

 Arcitecta’s core product, Mediaflux, is built to simplify complexity. Where other solutions require stitching together multiple tools for storage, metadata, movement, security, and automation, Mediaflux does it all in one platform. It’s metadata-native at its core, enabling organizations to manage data based on context, not just location. This approach means one can automatically move and protect petabytes of data without losing control or provenance. It also removes technical debt and accelerates time-to-value by giving enterprises a unified system that adapts to their specific workflows, rather than requiring them to adapt to the system.

 The Mediaflux data management platform powers a lot of synergetic capabilities. Can you tell us more about its features and various capabilities?

 Mediaflux is a single, integrated platform that combines data management, storage orchestration, metadata modeling, and advanced automation. One can search across billions of files instantly using rich metadata. Petabytes of data can be moved between storage tiers or sites with policy-based automation. Sensitive information is securely managed with fine-grained access controls and full audit trails. Custom workflows that tie together, ingest, move, or curate data for analysis are easily created. And with Point in Time recovery, one can roll back the entire environment to any previous state with minimal effort. It’s a platform designed for scale, flexibility, and security.

 With demand for AI-ready data on the rise, how is Arcitecta addressing AI data requirements?

 AI isn’t just hungry for data—it’s hungry for the right data: curated, high-quality, and accessible. Arcitecta helps organizations build AI-ready data ecosystems by making metadata the foundation. One can tag, classify, and enrich data automatically, making it easier to discover and feed into AI pipelines. Mediaflux supports the automation of data preparation and movement, reducing the manual overhead of wrangling large, distributed datasets. Successful AI initiatives all start with ready access to trusted, context-rich data, whether training models or deploying them in production.

 The Point in Time solution offers a fascinating paradigm shift for data security – what was the driving force behind its creation?

 Point in Time addresses the increasing risk of data loss—especially from ransomware and insider threats. Traditional backups are too slow and limited. One needs the ability to recover everything, instantly, including the metadata and access controls that make data usable. With Point in Time, one can easily restore their entire environment to a specific moment with confidence and precision. It’s not just about getting files back; it’s about restoring full operational continuity. This capability gives enterprises a powerful safety net while significantly reducing recovery time and risk.

 For internal data security, is multifactor authentication enough to thwart inside threats?

 Multifactor authentication (MFA) is essential, but it’s not enough. Internal threats often come from users who already have credentials. That’s why we take a layered approach. Mediaflux lets organizations define fine-grained permissions, log every interaction, and enforce data access policies dynamically. They can trace exactly who did what, when, and why. This level of observability and control makes it much harder for misuse to go undetected. Security isn’t just about blocking threats; it’s about visibility, accountability, and resilience. Arcitecta helps achieve all three.

 Looking ahead, what are Arcitecta’s priorities over the next few years to drive innovation in the rapidly changing data technology and management landscape?

 Our vision is to help organizations manage and leverage data at scale as simply as possible, all the while keeping their options open for new technologies. We’re investing heavily in automation, metadata intelligence, and hybrid-cloud capabilities. We’re enhancing our AI integrations, enabling more powerful data pipelines with less friction. And we’re continuing to push the boundaries of what’s possible with data movement, protection, and governance. Our focus remains on giving enterprises complete control over their data, wherever it lives so that they can innovate faster and with confidence.

 Anything else to share?

 Data is an organization’s most powerful asset, but only if it’s usable, trustworthy, and secure. However, data in the wrong hands can become an organization’s worst nightmare. Our goal is to help an enterprise leverage its data as a competitive advantage while mitigating its wrongful use. Whether one is supporting AI, scientific discovery, media production, or mission-critical operations, we’re here to help organizations get the most value from their data now and into the future.
