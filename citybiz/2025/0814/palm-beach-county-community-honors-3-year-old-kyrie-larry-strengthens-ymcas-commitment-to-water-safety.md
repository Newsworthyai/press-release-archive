# Palm Beach County Community Honors 3-Year Old Kyrie Larry, Strengthens YMCA’s Commitment to Water Safety

On Tuesday, August 12, community members gathered at the YMCA of the Palm Beaches’ Aquatic Center where the Boca West Children’s Foundation presented the YMCA with a sizable adaptive swim instruction grant in honor of the life of Kyrie Larry, a three-year-old boy with autism who tragically drowned earlier this year.

 During the heartfelt ceremony, YMCA President and CEO Timothy Coffield presented a commemorative plaque of Kyrie to his grandfather, Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office Deputy Kenneth “Coach T” Torrence. An identical plaque now hangs inside the entryway of the Aquatic Center, serving as a lasting reminder of the YMCA and Boca West Children’s Foundation’s dedication to preventing such tragedies.

 Boca West Children’s Foundation Executive Director Pamela Weinroth presented a $10,000 donation in Kyrie’s honor to benefit the Y’s Adaptive Swimming Program — a specialized initiative that equips children with physical and cognitive challenges, including autism, with life-saving water safety skills. For children on the autism spectrum, who are naturally drawn to water and often face heightened drowning risks, learning to swim can mean the difference between danger and safety.

 “Kyrie’s memory will forever be a part of the YMCA of the Palm Beaches’ Adaptive Swim Program” said Coffield. “His story reinforces why our commitment to adaptive swim instruction is so essential. Every child deserves the skills, confidence, and respect for water that will keep them safe — no matter their abilities. We are deeply grateful to Boca West Children’s Foundation for helping us continue this life-saving work.”
