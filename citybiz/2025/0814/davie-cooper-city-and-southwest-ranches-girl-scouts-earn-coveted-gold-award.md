# Davie, Cooper City, and Southwest Ranches Girl Scouts Earn Coveted Gold Award

Girl Scouts recognized for creating lasting change in their communities

 Davie residents Claire-Anya Likhachyov and Mia Medrano, Cooper City residents Ellen Huang and Lauren Rinella, and Southwest Ranches resident Kylin Reynolds have each earned the coveted Girl Scout Gold Award, the highest and most prestigious recognition attainable by Girl Scout seniors and ambassadors in grades nine through 12. This award highlights the creative and impactful projects these young changemakers have developed to address real-world challenges in their communities.

 Claire-Anya Likhachyov, Davie  For her project, Claire-Anya Likhachyov founded “STEM MENTORS CLUB,” a club at her high school that connects younger students with older peers who provide guidance, encouragement and academic help. According to the State of the Florida Girl report, fewer girls are entering STEM fields, although women make up 52% of Florida’s college-educated population, only 32% pursue careers in science or engineering, underscoring the need to spark interest early. The group offered free math tutoring, organized engaging educational events and developed a virtual career symposium featuring professionals from various technical fields. By sharing their experiences, the high school mentors helped younger students build perseverance and confidence. She also developed Girls Can STEM,” a virtual STEM symposium for girls that addressed the underrepresentation of women in fields requiring strong math and science skills. She recognized that a lack of female role models and early support often leads to decreased interest and confidence in these subjects. To ensure the longevity of her project, Likhachyov successfully established STEM MENTORS as a SWENext (Society of Women Engineers) charter club, giving future members access to valuable resources and networking opportunities.

 Mia Medrano, Davie  Mia Medrano combined her love for the environment and passion for education with her Gold Award project “Managing Mangroves,” to raise awareness about the critical role mangroves play in Florida’s ecosystem and the threats they face. She explored the impacts of climate change, coastal development and pollution on mangrove habitats, highlighting how their destruction not only harms the environment but also disrupts marine life and the health of local waterways. To bring the issue to life, Medrano filmed herself paddleboarding through local waterways, collecting trash and showing firsthand the damage caused by human impact. Her engaging videos explained how small, everyday actions, such as properly disposing of waste, can help preserve these vital ecosystems. She amplified her message into an accessible, ongoing educational resource for the public through a dedicated YouTube channel, MangroLife, Medrano continues to inform, educate and engage future volunteers and promote environmental stewardship.

 Ellen Huang, Cooper City Ellen Huang’s Gold Award project, “Eco Crafts Campaign: A Sustainable Future,” tackled the growing issue of food waste and its environmental impact. She recognized the need to educate others about the consequences of food waste and encourage more sustainable habits. Acknowledging how discarded food contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, pollution and rising food costs, Huang launched an educational campaign that included interactive workshops for children and a digital platform for teens and adults. She hosted workshops at Hawkes Bluff Elementary School and Camp Live Oak, where children learned about food waste and participated in hands-on crafts designed to reduce waste, including making reusable grocery bags, fabric food storage covers and egg carton vegetable gardens. For a broader audience, Huang created a website and social media page, @ecocraftscampaign, which provided information on food waste, sustainable habits and DIY tutorials for repurposing everyday items. Through her campaign, she educated others on meal planning, composting, proper food storage and other practical steps to minimize food waste.

 Lauren Rinella, Cooper City  The loss of her troop leader to cancer due to a late diagnosis led Lauren Rinella to her project, “BeYOUtifully Aware: Women’s Health & Cancer Prevention” to empower teenage girls and young women with crucial knowledge about women’s health, focusing on cancer prevention, early detection and the importance of regular health screenings. She hosted virtual workshops led by professionals in oncology, OB/GYN and nutrition, where participants learned about self-breast exams, mammogram guidelines and early warning signs of cancer. The sessions also introduced attendees to careers in the medical field, inspiring future paths in healthcare. The impact was measurable: participants’ knowledge of self-breast exams rose by 81.8%, understanding of mammogram screenings by 85.7% and confidence in health advocacy by 57.2%. To extend the reach of her project, Rinella launched a YouTube channel and encouraged attendees to share what they learned with others, multiplying the impact. In recognition of her work, Rinella was also awarded with the $2,500 Gina Rose Montalto Memorial Scholarship during the awards ceremony.

 Kylin Reynolds, Southwest Ranches  Kylin Reynolds’s project “Let’s Get Physical! Promoting Healthy Lives and Well-Being,” tackled the growing issue of youth inactivity by using the power of storytelling to encourage children to embrace movement as a fun and rewarding part of daily life. Aware of the physical and mental health consequences of sedentary lifestyles, such as poor muscle and bone development, increased obesity risk and lower academic performance, Reynolds wrote a children’s book featuring short stories about kids discovering the benefits of physical activity. She collaborated with a fellow Girl Scout to illustrate the book and worked with students to record audiobook versions, making her stories widely accessible on YouTube and Instagram. Initially aiming to reach 75 students, she quickly surpassed that goal, engaging nearly 200 students in just one month through partnerships with schools and youth organizations. Survey feedback revealed that 98% of participants learned something new about physical activity and many expressed excitement about finding new ways to get moving. To ensure her project’s continued impact, Reynolds donated books to school libraries and classrooms, and her online resources remain available for future readers. In recognition of her leadership and community impact, Reynolds was honored with the $3,000 ECHO Scholarship during the awards ceremony.
