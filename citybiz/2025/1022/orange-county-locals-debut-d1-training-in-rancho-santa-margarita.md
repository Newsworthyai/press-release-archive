# Orange County Locals Debut D1 Training in Rancho Santa Margarita

D1 Training, a leading fitness enrichment concept utilizing the five core tenets of athletic-based training, will be opening a new location in Rancho Santa Margarita at 29851 Aventura on October 25. The new group fitness facility employs a sports-science backed training regimen led by certified trainers to help people of all ages achieve their sport and fitness goals.

 In celebration of the new location’s launch, Rancho Santa Margarita neighbors and residents are encouraged to stop by and meet the facility’s team at its grand opening event on Saturday, October 25.

 Giang Ma and Merrick Miranda will join a roster of impressive existing franchisees, including professional athletes like Kylie Fitts and Jordan Gay. Additional D1 partners include NBA star Chris Paul and Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow.

 Giang and Merrick are longtime friends and former chemical engineers, who have always shared a passion for health, fitness, and community. Both began their careers in the oil and gas industry as consultants before moving into leadership roles, with Giang transitioning into pharmaceuticals and Merrick into business development and sales within the construction industry. As parents of young athletes, they were immediately drawn to D1’s structured, goal-oriented training model and its focus on building character through athletics. They love how D1 combines a team environment with individualized coaching, creating a space where people of all ages can train like athletes.

 “We see D1 as a place where hard work meets purpose,” said Merrick. “It’s not just about physical training—it’s about helping people push past limits, stay accountable, and become the best version of themselves. That’s what makes this so meaningful to us.”

 D1 Training offers four age-based programs including Rookie (ages 7-11), Developmental (ages 12-14), Prep (ages 15-18) and D1 Adult. Each fitness program is based on the five athletic-based tenets: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down. Outside of group workouts, D1 Training offers group, semi-private, and one-on-one training with world-class coaches. The goal is simple: to continue to train athletes who are dedicated to their sport or fitness goals, regardless of age, or athletic background.

 “Giang and Merrick are the ideal candidates to bring the D1 Training experience to Rancho Santa Margarita,” said the brand’s Chief Operating Officer, Dan Murphy. “We’re thrilled to welcome them to the D1 family and are confident in their ability to show the Rancho Santa Margarita area what they’ve been missing out on. D1 is a one-of-a-kind fitness experience that’s built around the individual and meant to help people meet their athletic goals. Our strong network of franchisees embodies our core values to bring the D1 Training vision to life, and we know they will do just that in Orange County and its surrounding communities.”

 Strategically expanding across the nation through franchising, D1 Training has more than 100 performance centers open with over 100 additional locations in various stages of development. The brand is currently seeking financially qualified business builders, former athletes, and entrepreneurs, who share a passion for fitness and youth sports, who are ready to make a positive impact on their community.
