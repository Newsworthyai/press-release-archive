# Stevens-Leinweber adds DJ Peterson as Business Development Lead

Phoenix-based Stevens-Leinweber Construction (SLC) has hired DJ Peterson as Business Development lead, tasked with supporting and expanding the company’s network within a quickly evolving metro Phoenix commercial real estate market.

 Peterson’s responsibilities include establishing and nurturing SLC client relationships and identifying new opportunities to drive growth by applying the company’s more than 40 years of ground-up and tenant construction expertise.

 “Phoenix has changed dramatically over the decades, and we’ve succeeded by growing in step – prioritizing our current relationships and responsibilities while seeking out new ways to serve our clients and a market that now includes advanced manufacturing, ultra-sophisticated logistics and highly creative office environments,” said Stevens-Leinweber Construction President and CEO Jamie Godwin. “DJ is a seasoned relationship manager, collaborator and continuous learner who is equally committed to honoring our past while embracing the future.”

 “Strong relationships start with understanding and then evolve into strategies that drive meaningful results,” said Peterson. “I’ve known and respected the SLC leadership team for years and am excited to do just that for our company, applying our core values and expertise for the benefit of our clients and the communities where we build.”

 Peterson is a former baseball agent and player who spent nearly a decade in the minor league with the Mariners, Reds, White Sox and Rockies before transitioning into the construction industry. He is a member of the Arizona Chapter of NAIOP, Greater Phoenix Economic Council and ULI. He holds a bachelor’s degree in Humanities from the University of New Mexico.
