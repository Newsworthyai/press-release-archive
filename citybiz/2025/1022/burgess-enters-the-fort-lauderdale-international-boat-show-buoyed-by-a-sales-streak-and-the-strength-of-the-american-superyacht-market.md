# Burgess Enters the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show Buoyed by a Sales Streak and the Strength of the American Superyacht Market

With the American superyacht market continuing to demonstrate record-breaking strength, Burgess, the global leader in luxury yachting, is heading into the 2025 Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show (October 29 – November 2) with strong wind in its sails. The company recently achieved three major sales in succession, underscoring the vitality of U.S. demand and reinforcing Burgess’ growing presence across the Americas.

 “As confidence in the U.S. luxury market continues to rise, we’re seeing unprecedented enthusiasm from American clients seeking both new builds and brokerage opportunities,” said Jonathan Beckett, CEO of Burgess. “The Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show remains one of the world’s premier stages for yachting, and this year we look forward to continuing that momentum with a truly standout fleet and an energized team.”

 With five decades of industry leadership and 18 offices worldwide, Burgess continues to expand its U.S. operations, leveraging a surge in American ownership and charter activity. At this year’s show, the firm will present a dynamic lineup of yachts that reflect the depth of today’s market – from cutting-edge catamarans to classic Northern European builds – each representing the Burgess standard of excellence in design, performance, and pedigree.
