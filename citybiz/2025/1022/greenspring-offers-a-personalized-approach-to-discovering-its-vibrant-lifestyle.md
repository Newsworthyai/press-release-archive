# Greenspring Offers a Personalized Approach to Discovering Its Vibrant Lifestyle

By Kelly Shue

 When it comes to researching a retirement community, there’s nothing quite like seeing it for yourself. At Greenspring, an Erickson Senior Living community in Springfield, Va., there are countless ways to do just that!

 From personalized appointments to informational events and group tours, Greenspring invites prospective residents to explore the community at their own pace–with no pressure.

 “I’m grateful for the many opportunities I had to spend time on campus,” says Mary Ann Munn, who conducted her due diligence before moving to Greenspring in June. “I made sure to attend all the events that were offered to me, including seminars and open houses.”

 She adds, “I asked a lot of questions. The sales team answered all my calls and emails. And, at no time did I ever feel pressured to make a decision.”

 “We want to give people all the information they need to help them determine whether Greenspring is the right fit for them,” notes Sales Director Franklin Funes. “That’s the most important thing!”

 Exploring her options When Mary Ann started exploring her senior living options, Greenspring was on her radar, as it’s only five minutes from her son Larry and his family.

 “My oldest grandson even has several friends working on campus,” says Mary Ann, “but I knew I needed to look at several communities before making my decision.”

 She continues, “In addition to finding a safe and secure community, I wanted a place with a pool– because I love water aerobics–and a home with a patio or balcony.”

 To learn more about the community, Mary Ann scheduled a visit to Greenspring and met with Sales Counselor Arzo Haider.

 “Arzo is lovely. She asked questions that helped her learn about me, so she could best direct her efforts,” says Mary Ann. “What impressed me early on is that Greenspring has a college campus feel, unlike some of the high-rise communities I visited. I also learned that Greenspring has several doctors working on-site. I think that’s a really big deal.”

 Priority List perks Because Greenspring checked all her boxes, Mary Ann took the next step and joined the Priority List. In addition to saving a spot in line for a residence, Priority List members receive invitations to exclusive informational events and gain access to planning and moving support.

 Mary Ann found the educational events to be very helpful.

 “I made a point to come to everything I could,” she says. “When I came to seminars, I appreciated hearing other people’s questions, because their questions would often spark a question in my own head. And I always asked a lot of questions, too. I wanted to make sure I was making the right decision.”

 Mary Ann found Greenspring’s Parade of Homes to be especially impactful, as it was a great way to explore the community’s residences. “Seeing as many floor plans as possible was very helpful, as was talking to people who lived in the homes,” she explains.

 Another benefit of her frequent visits to Greenspring was the opportunity to interact with current residents.

 “Each time I visited, I felt comfortable going around campus and talking with residents,” she says. “Often, they would stop me and say hello. I could tell that people are happy at Greenspring.”

 Living the life Mary Ann also had the chance to sign up for a Live the Life stay–another perk exclusive to Priority List members. The program allows members to stay overnight in a furnished guest suite, utilize amenities, join club meetings, dine at on-campus restaurants, and chat with current residents.

 Mary Ann brought a friend for her Live the Life stay, during which they participated in a Latin dance class, joined a sing-along with the Troubadours, and shared meals with residents.

 “It was a very good experience. It’s like when you want to buy a new car and you go out for a test-drive,” she says.

 Now, Mary Ann is enjoying those same activities and much more as a resident, including water aerobics classes and dinners with neighbors on her floor.

 “My biggest piece of advice is to come for a visit,” Mary Ann says. “It’s the best first step while conducting your research. Also, talk to as many people as you can, both residents and staff. Everyone is so friendly.”

 She adds, “It’s so important to move when you are able to enjoy all there is to do here. Life is very good!”
