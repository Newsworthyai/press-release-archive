# The Best Ways to Learn About Senior Living

By Gregory J. Alexander

 When Roger Heinrich and Beverly Lukas were planning on selling their house and moving to a retirement community, they initially considered relocating closer to their son, who lives in Philadelphia, Pa.

 “I looked online at communities near Philadelphia because a lot of people move closer to their children and grandchildren. Then, I thought, ‘What are we going to do there?’ We’d be starting all over, and our children have lives of their own,” recalls Beverly.

 So, the couple looked at Lantern Hill, an Erickson Senior Living community in New Providence, N.J., which was just 10 minutes away from their former house in Scotch Plains, N.J.

 “We could keep our own doctors, attend the same church, and only be 10 minutes from our longtime friends,” says Roger.

 But, when it comes to researching a retirement community, there’s nothing quite like seeing it for yourself. That’s why Roger and Beverly took advantage of the variety of ways to explore Lantern Hill’s vibrant lifestyle firsthand.

 “The Lantern Hill sales team offers personal appointments, educational events, and group tours, all designed to help prospective residents get familiar with the community and gain the information they’re looking for,” explains Sales Director Kate Tanis.

 Roger and Beverly’s first step was scheduling an appointment with a sales team member. Tanis and her team see each appointment as an opportunity to share information about the community’s amenities, finances, floor plans, and lifestyle.

 “These introductory appointments help us find the right home for you. We want to find out what’s important to you and what your priorities are. It’s also a great way to get to know you as a person,” says Tanis.

 Live the Life Impressed with everything they saw and heard during their appointment, Roger and Beverly decided to join Lantern Hill’s Priority List.

 Priority List members receive invitations to exclusive informational and social events, save their spot in line for a future residence, and can sign up for a Live the Life stay–an overnight experience in a furnished suite stocked with guests’ favorite snacks and beverages.

 Members can utilize amenities, join club meetings, dine at on-campus restaurants, and spend time with current residents.

 “I highly recommend the Live the Life program,” says Roger. “We stayed at Lantern Hill for two nights, and it made us more comfortable with the community before we made the move.”

 Beverly adds, “We had six meals with different residents and went to some exercise classes. We got to live in the community; I felt more comfortable navigating the community.”

 Sold on the vibrant lifestyle and range of services, Roger and Beverly knew that Lantern Hill was the community for them.

 A home with a view When it came time to choose their new home, they were specifically looking for a two-bedroom residence with a nice view.

 “Now, we’re on the third floor and back up to the woods behind the building–a very comforting setting,” says Beverly.

 Roger notes that the second bedroom makes it even easier for their kids to visit. Unlike the couple’s former split-level house, where they grew tired of climbing stairs, having all rooms on one level better suits their current lifestyle. The elevator just steps from their front door helps them access any amenity on campus.

 “When we show homes to prospective residents, we are continuously taking notes on what is important to them, such as space, view, and morning or afternoon sun exposure,” notes Tanis.

 So much to do Although they are still relatively new to the community, Roger says he is looking forward to swimming in the pool as well as joining the Bogey Bunch, a golfing group that plays nine holes of golf nearby. The couple also plans to continue taking the bus to New York City to enjoy Broadway theater performances.

 “I also love how the meals are structured at Lantern Hill. We can dine at the restaurants or we can order takeout. We already have had two couples come over and have dinner with us at our place,” Roger says.

 “Not long ago,” adds Beverly, “I ran into a woman that I had known for years from Scotch Plains. She and her husband were one of the first people who moved into Lantern Hill. So, I said, ‘Well, come and have lunch with us!'”

 Most of all, Roger and Beverly appreciate the peace of mind that Lantern Hill offers them–and their family. “Our kids don’t have to worry about anything,” says Roger. To learn more about the ways you can explore senior living, request more information today.
