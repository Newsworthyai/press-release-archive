# Fox Run Offers a Personalized Approach to Discovering Its Vibrant Lifestyle

By Michele Wojciechowski

 When George and Ellie Nosky received a postcard inviting them to a lunch and tour of Fox Run, an Erickson Senior Living community in Novi, Mich., they gladly accepted.

 Impressed with everything they saw, the couple was eager to explore the community further, so they joined the Priority List. In addition to saving their spot in line for a residence, Priority List members receive invitations to exclusive informational and social events as well as the opportunity to stay overnight on campus.

 “We took advantage of the Priority List program, but there was no pressure from sales staff,” says George.

 “There are lots of ways for prospective residents to explore Fox Run, including joining the Priority List,” says Sales Director Allison Murphy. “We want to give people all the information they need to help them determine whether Fox Run is the right fit for them.”

 Thanks to their research, George and Ellie knew–without a doubt–that Fox Run was the right place for them.

 “We wanted to gather information before we totally committed, and everyone here was so helpful,” says Ellie. “We are definitely happy about coming here!”

 See for yourself Those interested in learning more about Fox Run can schedule a personal appointment with a sales team member or attend an introductory event.

 “Scheduling an appointment allows us to offer insight into pricing and answer any questions you have,” explains Murphy. “When someone comes in for the first time, our goal is to inform them about all their options and help them understand how exciting modern-day senior living really is.”

 She continues, “Attending an event–like a luncheon, for example–is a great opportunity to tour the community, learn more about our vibrant lifestyle, and mingle with current residents.”

 Priority List perks Priority List members gain access to even more events and opportunities that highlight the community’s offerings.

 “We host anywhere from eight to ten educational and social events each year, exclusive to Priority List members,” notes Murphy.

 George and Ellie attended several informational events, which included presentations from the Finance and Resident Life departments. They also heard about the medical center and its services, provided by full-time health care professionals.

 “We took advantage of all of them,” says Ellie. “We would get invited to other retirement communities, [so the events allowed us] to go there and see the differences. For us, it was very beneficial.”

 Murphy notes that the social events often include outdoor barbecues, pickleball games, outdoor concerts, and more. “There’s something fun for everyone!” she says.

 Live the Life Thanks to the Live the Life program, Priority List members also have the opportunity to experience Fox Run’s vibrant lifestyle firsthand. Members can book an overnight stay in a furnished guest suite, utilize amenities, join club meetings, dine at the community’s restaurants, and chat with current residents.

 During their Live the Life stay, George and Ellie visited Fox Run’s TV studio and participated in discussion groups on diverse topics.

 “We had coffee and cookies and then chatted with the residents,” recalls Ellie. “We really had a good time talking with them and getting to know each other a bit.”

 George visited the woodworking shop and joined a model railroad club meeting. “They included me and took time to explain what they were doing,” he says.

 Ellie explored the fitness center, where she tried out the exercise machines, and stopped to visit with the mah-jongg group.

 Now, they’re enjoying these activities–and more–as residents themselves, as they moved into a two-bedroom, two-bath home with a patio at Fox Run in November 2024.

 Join today! Murphy and her team look forward to meeting more prospective residents in 2026 and offering a range of fun, engaging ways to learn more about the community.

 “Everyone has different priorities when exploring their options. Some people find comfort in the company’s financial stability. Others want to know they can build relationships with neighbors and have fun,” she explains. “We provide a variety to meet each person’s needs.”

 She urges anyone considering Fox Run to join the Priority List, not only because it’s a great way to learn more, but because the community currently has a high occupancy rate.

 “It’s your best chance of getting the floor plan you want!” she says.

 Request more information today to learn more about all the different ways you can explore the vibrant lifestyle at Fox Run.
