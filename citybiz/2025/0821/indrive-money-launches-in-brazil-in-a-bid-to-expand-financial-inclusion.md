# inDrive.Money Launches in Brazil in a Bid to Expand Financial Inclusion

inDrive, a global mobility and urban services platform operating across 48 countries, announced today the launch of inDrive.Money in Brazil. The offering aims to support financial inclusion for drivers by offering quick and convenient access to cash loans within the inDrive app, the world’s second-most downloaded ride-hailing app.

 inDrive.Money is partnering with EmpreX, a Latin American fintech specializing in financing for small businesses and service providers, enabling drivers to apply for the loans and repay them directly in the inDrive app.

 “At inDrive, our mission is to empower people with fair choices. Brazil is one of our most important markets globally, with hundreds of thousands of driver partners who depend on the platform for income. By launching inDrive.Money here, backed by our experience in Mexico, Colombia, and Peru, we are offering a proven financial tool that strengthens their economic independence and supports their daily livelihoods,” said Alexander Kurchin, Head of Growth at inDrive.Money.

 Initial results show that drivers who accessed financing have become more engaged. Satisfaction is high: 86% said they would take out another loan if needed and are willing to recommend the product. The goal is to expand the product to all cities where inDrive operates in Brazil. Currently, the solution is available in approximately 90 locations, including larger cities such as Manaus, Fortaleza, Salvador, Belo Horizonte, and Florianópolis, as well as mid-sized ones like Campinas and Marabá.

 

 “Brazil’s service providers power the country every day, but many are forced to resort to loans with exorbitant terms. By integrating EmpreX credit directly into the inDrive app, we’re transforming complex workflows into just a few taps, putting real working capital in the pockets of inDrive’s partner drivers and delivery people exactly when they need it. The integrated loan gives them freedom, flexibility, and the ability to stay on the road without interruption,” added Silvan Roth, CEO of EmpreX.

 Through the inDrive app, drivers on the platform in Brazil can check available offers and apply for credit in just a few clicks. EmpreX manages the entire assessment process — from analysis to financing, including scoring, repayment terms and loans disbursement — with regulatory compliance supported by its partnership with BMP SCD, a licensed Brazilian financial institution.

 Incorporating financial services into its app in Brazil is part of inDrive’s continued expansion and diversification beyond its core ride-hailing product. It is aligned with the company’s mission to improve the lives of 1 billion people by 2030, including by providing fair services and helping expand financial inclusion.
