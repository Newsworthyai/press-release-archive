# Q&amp;A with Ken Haines, CEO of Wrench Group

Ken Haines was appointed CEO of Wrench Group in 2016, transitioning from his position as CEO of Coolray, which he held since 2003. Ken brings with him more than 40 years of experience in the home services industry. Since 2016, Ken’s leadership of the Wrench Group has guided the company to become the second-largest, non-franchised home services company in the United States, partnering with operations in key markets across the country.

 Ken’s leadership philosophy is anchored in four core principles: partner with market-leading companies and cultures; attract and retain the best team members; enable cross-market collaboration, and deliver exceptional customer service experiences. Ken believes in accelerating existing local growth through industry-leading people, technology, marketing, and operations resources and support.

 You have been in the home services industry space for 40+ years, and you were appointed Wrench Group CEO in 2016. Can you provide a brief background about your experience and how you ended up at Wrench Group?

 My journey in this industry really started with curiosity and a drive to build something of my own. At just 19 years old, I launched Haines Air Conditioning & Appliance Repair. That experience taught me what it means to roll up your sleeves and build a business from scratch. It was hard work, but it gave me a deep appreciation for the impact a local home services company can have on its community.

 After selling that business, I moved to Florida and spent time getting to know a new market. That eventually led me to BlueDot in 1997, where I had the chance to lead acquisition and development efforts across the country. It was eye-opening to see the different ways strong local businesses were run and to learn what helped them thrive.

 Later, I took another leap and purchased Coolray, a residential HVAC company. We grew it from $6 million to $60 million in revenue, and that growth reinforced a belief I’d carried with me all along — that the real strength of this industry lies in local businesses and the people who lead them.

 That belief came full circle in 2016, when I saw an opportunity to bring together some of the best companies in the space — Coolray, Berkeys, Abacus Plumbing, and Parker & Sons – to form Wrench Group. The vision was simple but powerful: create a platform that gives local businesses the resources to grow while preserving what makes them unique. With the support of private equity, we built a collaborative model that lets companies expand without losing their identity.

 That’s how I became CEO of Wrench Group, and it’s still the most rewarding part of my career – helping great local businesses grow, while staying true to their roots.

 What first drew you to the home services industry and what’s kept you here all this time?

 From the time I was 15, I knew I wanted to be an entrepreneur, and I found my path in air conditioning and appliance repair. There was something so rewarding about being able to fix something for a family and know that you’d made their day a little easier. That feeling of solving real problems for real people is what first drew me in.

 What’s kept me here all these years is that the industry is about so much more than just the technical work. It’s about the people, both the customers who trust us in their homes and the teams of hard-working professionals who take pride in their craft. That combination of purpose, problem-solving, and people has made this not just a career for me, but a lifelong passion.

 Skilled trades are gaining traction with younger generations. What is Wrench Group doing specifically to attract and engage Gen Z talent in HVAC, plumbing, and electrical careers?

 At Wrench Group, we believe that “by investing in our teams, we build a stronger future together.” That mindset really drives how we think about recruiting and workforce development. For us, training and education aren’t just add-ons, they’re central to how we grow and how we give people real career opportunities.

 Gen Z is already making up a significant share of new hires in the trades, so we’ve been intentional about creating pathways that meet them where they are. One of the ways we do this is through our three academy programs, which serve as true talent pipelines. These academies are designed not only to teach technical skills and keep people up to date on certifications, safety, and new technologies, but also to give younger employees a clear sense of purpose, value, and long-term growth.

 What makes our approach unique is that we don’t just recruit based on experience. We recruit for mindset. If someone has mechanical aptitude, good communication skills, and the drive to learn, we’ll invest in developing the rest. That’s especially appealing to Gen Z, who often want structured learning, mentorship, and the chance to build a meaningful career.

 It’s also why Wrench Group today has the largest network of W-2 technicians in the industry. We’ve built a culture of continuous improvement that resonates with the next generation of skilled professionals.

 Recent studies show 42% of Gen Z are pursuing skilled trade careers. Why do you think they’re turning away from the traditional college route and how does Wrench Group fit into that shift?

 Gen Z is rethinking the traditional college path for several reasons. Rising tuition costs and uncertain returns on investment are making many question whether a degree truly guarantees a stable, well-paying career. At the same time, they’re drawn to work that’s practical, hands-on, and meaningful, where they can see the impact of their efforts and start building a career quickly. Skilled trades, like HVAC, plumbing, and electrical work, check all those boxes, offering competitive pay, growth opportunities, and lower barriers to entry.

 Wrench Group fits into this shift by providing structured, accessible pathways through our academy programs. These programs combine hands-on training with real-world experience, giving young people the skills, confidence, and career opportunities they need, without the burden of college debt. By creating clear paths to long-term success, we’re helping Gen Z see that a fulfilling and financially rewarding career in the trades is not only possible, but within reach.

 Wrench Group companies like Morris Jenkins and Coolray offer immersive, in-house training with modeled residential homes. Why is that hands-on education model so critical especially for Gen Z?

 Hands-on, immersive training is critical, especially for Gen Z, because it gives them the practical experience and confidence they need to succeed from day one. At Wrench Group, our academy programs, led by Morris-Jenkins, Service Champions, and Coolray, blend classroom instruction with real-world, field-based experience. This approach ensures consistency in skills, safety, and company culture while building a steady pipeline of trained technicians.

 For example, our Service Champions’ Champions University combines technical training with life skills like communication, time management, and professionalism, preparing technicians to deliver not just on the job, but in the customer experience. Coolray pairs classroom instruction with on-the-job mentorship to guide trainees toward certifications in HVAC, plumbing, or installation, emphasizing candidates who show a commitment to learning and personal growth. Meanwhile, Morris-Jenkins’ Build-a-Plumber program is an eight-week paid course that mixes classroom learning, hands-on labs, and in-field experience, graduating technicians fully prepared to launch a successful career in residential plumbing.

 By combining structured learning with immersive, real-world experience, these programs meet Gen Z where they thrive – learning by doing, seeing immediate results, and building a career with confidence.

 Can you tell us a little more about Wrench University and how it is helping to develop the company’s workforce?

 Our industry’s traditional focus has always been on developing skilled technicians. However, our challenge lies in cultivating those technicians into effective leaders by assessing their willingness to assume leadership roles and, subsequently, ensuring they possess the requisite skills and resources to fulfill these roles. Leadership requires a different skill set, such as managing people, budgets, and business outcomes. Historically, the skilled trades haven’t provided a clear path or support system to make that leap.

 As a result, Wrench University was created to target senior field technicians and mid-level management with the essential skills to lead effectively. The program provides practical education on the fundamentals of management and leadership, with the curriculum covering Servant Leadership, Navigating the Multi-Generational Workforce, Interviewing Talent to Stick, Big Picture Thinking, Leveraging Knowledge, Conflict Management, Building Teams, Empowering and Inspiring Others, and more.

 Delivered through convenient online micro-learning formats, Wrench University supports field technicians and leaders on the go. Wrench plans to expand this initiative into a comprehensive Leadership Institute focused on developing a robust leadership pipeline, with intensive training from running a profitable business to advanced leadership, ensuring strong bench strength at the senior and executive levels.

 How has Wrench Group adapted its recruiting and marketing strategies to connect with tech-savvy, digital-first Gen Z job seekers?

 Wrench Group has adapted its recruiting and marketing strategies to better connect with tech-savvy, digital-first Gen Z job seekers by fully embracing a digital-first approach. Our recruiting teams actively seek talent on the online platforms and digital channels where younger candidates spend their time, focusing less on traditional job boards and more on search, display, texting, and engagement platforms like Glassdoor. In fact, by 2024, approximately 60–70% of our technicians were from Gen Z, highlighting the importance of meeting this generation where they are. We showcase career development opportunities through social media, digital campaigns, and interactive content, emphasizing growth, learning, and advancement. And since Gen Z values authenticity, we prioritize transparent communication that reflects our company culture, connects leadership directly with younger talent, and underscores our commitment to workforce development.

 Where do you see Wrench Group headed in the next 5-10 years, particularly as the workforce and home services landscape continue to evolve?

 Over the next 5-10 years, I see Wrench Group continuing to innovate and grow alongside the evolving home services and skilled trades landscape. We plan to expand our academy programs nationwide to build a stronger, more sustainable talent pipeline and invest in technology that improves both service delivery and recruitment.

 Just as important is fostering a workplace culture focused on continuous learning, adaptability, and long-term growth. By aligning our strategies with Gen Z’s expectations and leveraging scalable training models, we aim to set the standard in talent retention, performance, and employee satisfaction, helping shape the future of skilled trades across the country.
