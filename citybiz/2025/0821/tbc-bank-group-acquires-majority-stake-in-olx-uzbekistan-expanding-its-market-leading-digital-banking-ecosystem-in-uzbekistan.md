 For the OLX UZ acquisition, TBC Bank Group formed a joint venture (JV) with Titan Investments, an international investment holding company backed by top-tier international institutional investors, family offices and sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East. The JV acquires 100% of OLX Uzbekistan, with TBC Bank Group owning 50% + 1 share and Titan Investments owning the remaining stake in the JV. The deal is subject to standard regulatory approvals.
