# Priority Capital Advisory Arranges $12.75 Million Loan for the Refinance of a Specialty Retail Property in Fremont, California

Zachary Streit, Founder and President of Priority Capital Advisory, has arranged $12.75 million in senior debt financing for the recapitalization of Newark Auto Plaza on behalf of the borrower, Nearon Enterprises. Situated on 14.8 acres, the multi-tenant automotive dealership complex is located at 39700-39750 Balentine Drive and 5623-5633 John Muir Drive in Fremont, Calif.

 “The timing of the financing posed unique challenges, as the client was pursuing a non-recourse loan from a regional bank for a specialty retail property—specifically, an auto dealership—while navigating changing macroeconomic conditions shaped by recent tariff announcements and growing trade tensions,” said Streit. “After a thorough process involving multiple proposals from regional banks, we ultimately chose a lending partner well-positioned to support the client long-term.”

 The three-building property totals 110,540-square-feet, features both showrooms and service/repair centers, and is fully occupied by Fremont Ford, Winn KIA of Fremont, and Cruise America RV. The property is approximately 20 minutes from San Jose and Silicon Valley, 40 miles southeast of downtown San Francisco, and is situated directly adjacent to the I-880 Freeway with 800 feet of frontage.

 “We were really appreciative of Priority Capital’s patience in taking the necessary time to find the right lender during the process,” said EVP/CFO Blaine Emmons of Nearon Enterprises.

 Since its inception just over a year ago, Priority Capital Advisory has closed more than $500 million in debt financing across 23 transactions. Over the past four months alone, Streit has led the closings of six retail loans totaling $131.25 million. The firm continues to earn a reputation for moving quickly, working tirelessly, and delivering liquidity solutions for sophisticated sponsors in challenging capital markets.
