# Lynkwell Celebrates Fourth Year on the Inc. 5000 List and New Executive Team Member

Lynkwell, a leading energy infrastructure provider, announces its fourth consecutive year on the Inc. 5000 list of fastest-growing private companies in America. Demonstrating three-year revenue growth of 268 percent, Lynkwell’s comprehensive suite of U.S.-based energy related hardware, software, and service solutions continues to find market validation in a dynamic industry.

 Fourth Consecutive Year on the Inc. 5000 List

 The Inc. 5000 list recognizes those independent companies who successfully navigate the rigors of entrepreneurship to achieve outstanding financial performance. Lynkwell’s 3-year growth rate of 268% outpaced the 169% median growth rate of the 2025 class.

 Contributing to this year’s success is the launch of several exclusive offerings designed to deliver the charging infrastructure performance demanded by the burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) industry. Portfolio highlights include Lynkwell’s EVSE-360 charging infrastructure protection plan, its QuickLynk automated charger onboarding solution, and the Lynkwell Upgrade charger replacement program. These offerings, combined with Lynkwell’s existing comprehensive suite of hardware, software, and service solutions, is why Lynkwell remains one of the top ten public charging networks in the United States.

 “We are always honored to be recognized by Inc., but this year means something much more,” commented Jason Zarillo, president of Lynkwell. “In an industry as dynamic as electrification infrastructure, keeping pace is not enough. This past year, Lynkwell has proven that it can outpace and deliver on the demands of an industry both growing at tremendous speed and navigating unprecedented pressures. Our team and technology are recognized as the leaders they are, and I could not be prouder.”

 “Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” says Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm—they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”

Lynkwell Appoints New Chief Financial Officer

 As Lynkwell continues to expand its offerings and invest in AI-driven automations to drive performance, it is bolstering its executive leadership team with the appointment of Frank Kosky as chief financial officer. With more than two decades of executive financial leadership experience, Kosky brings proven expertise in corporate finance and operational transformation, and strategic growth that will help accelerate Lynkwell’s expansion in the rapidly evolving EV sector. In his role as CFO, Kosky will oversee financial strategy and planning to support Lynkwell’s mission of advancing clean energy adoption through accessible and reliable EV charging solutions. He has a strong record of building high-performing finance organizations, strengthening operational efficiency, and driving long-term value creation for stakeholders.

 “Frank’s financial expertise and leadership skills make him an excellent addition to our executive team,” shared Schuyler Poukish, chief executive officer of Lynkwell. “His ability to align financial strategy with operational execution will be critical as we continue to scale and expand our impact nationwide.”

 “I am excited to join Lynkwell at such a pivotal time for both the company and the industry,” said Kosky. “Lynkwell’s mission to transform clean energy access and EV infrastructure aligns with my own passion for building sustainable, high-growth businesses. I look forward to working closely with the team to deliver on this vision.”

 By cultivating the most comprehensive and integrated suite of solutions, Lynkwell positions itself as the one partner any stakeholder needs to thrive in the EV charging ecosystem.
