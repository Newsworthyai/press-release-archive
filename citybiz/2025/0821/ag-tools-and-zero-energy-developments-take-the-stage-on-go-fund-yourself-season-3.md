# AG Tools and Zero Energy Developments Take the Stage on Go Fund Yourself Season 3

Cheddar TV’s Go Fund Yourself continues to spotlight founders tackling some of the economy’s most pressing challenges. Season 3, Episode 3 featured two ventures at the intersection of technology, sustainability, and scale: AGTools, a data intelligence platform reshaping the global food supply chain, and Zero Energy Developments, a pioneer in climate-resilient housing.

 A Platform for High-Growth Entrepreneurs

 Now in its third season, Go Fund Yourself has evolved into more than a televised pitch competition. The series gives startups national visibility, access to seasoned titans including Rory Cutaia, Jayson Waller, and David Meltzer, and exposure to equity crowdfunding opportunities. By aligning entertainment with capital formation, the show is creating a unique pipeline for investors seeking early-stage opportunities with both market traction and cultural relevance.

 AGTools: Bringing Data Discipline to Agriculture

 

 Agriculture remains one of the least digitized industries, yet it represents more than $1.3 trillion of the U.S. economy. AGTools, led by CEO Martha Montoya, is addressing this gap with a real-time platform that aggregates government and institutional data on more than 500 fruits, vegetables, and commodities.

 The tool enables growers, distributors, and retailers to reduce spoilage, forecast demand, and improve pricing decisions. Early adopters are already reporting multi-million-dollar gains. With the specialty-crop market facing volatility from climate change and supply chain pressures, AGTools positions itself as a critical infrastructure play for the $5 billion ag-data market.

 Zero Energy Developments: Scaling Climate-Resilient Housing

 Rising energy costs and climate volatility are accelerating demand for sustainable housing. Zero Energy Developments, founded by Armando and Anita Ortega, is building homes designed to operate fully off-grid. Each residence integrates solar power, battery storage, and AI-driven energy management systems, exceeding both Zero Energy and Energy Star standards.

 The model offers recurring revenue potential through energy optimization services while meeting urgent housing demand in markets where resilience and efficiency are increasingly non-negotiable. For investors, Zero Energy Developments represents an early entry into a sector poised for double-digit growth over the next decade.

 Why It Matters

 What sets Go Fund Yourself apart is the combination of visibility, validation, and capital access it provides. Founders aren’t only pitching for investment—they’re demonstrating proof points in front of a national audience and gaining insight from industry leaders who understand the demands of scaling.

 By showcasing companies like AGTools and Zero Energy Developments, the series underscores where investor capital is flowing: into data-driven efficiency platforms and sustainable infrastructure. Both categories reflect broader macro trends—digitization of legacy industries and decarbonization of the built environment—that are reshaping global markets.
