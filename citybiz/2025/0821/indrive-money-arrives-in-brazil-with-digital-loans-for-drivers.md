# inDrive.Money Arrives in Brazil with Digital Loans for Drivers

inDrive, a global mobility and urban services platform operating across 48 countries, has announced the launch of inDrive.Money in Brazil. The offering aims to support financial inclusion for drivers by offering quick and convenient access to cash loans within the inDrive app, the world’s second-most downloaded ride-hailing app.

 inDrive.Money is partnering with EmpreX, a Latin American fintech specializing in financing for small businesses and service providers, to unlock loans of up to R$3,000 (USD 548) for drivers in Brazil. inDrive.Money enables drivers to apply for the loans and repay them directly via the inDrive app.

 Approved borrowers can obtain credit with an average term of five months until the first payment. Approximately 10% to 14% of the value of each ride is automatically allocated towards loan repayment, allowing for a smooth process without fixed daily commitments. Drivers can also make payments directly to EmpreX if they wish, giving them the freedom to manage their cash flow across multiple platforms.

 Alexander Kurchin, Head of Growth at inDrive.Money, commented:

 “At inDrive, our mission is to empower people with fair choices. Brazil is one of our most important markets globally, with hundreds of thousands of driver partners who depend on the platform for income. By launching inDrive.Money here, backed by our experience in Mexico, Colombia, and Peru, we are offering a proven financial tool that strengthens their economic independence and supports their daily livelihoods.”

 Globally, drivers and gig workers often face challenges accessing fair financial services. In Brazil, despite the country’s leadership in fintech innovation, many remain underserved by traditional banks that require extensive credit history, while informal loans often have punitive interest rates. To address this gap, inDrive and EmpreX are launching a transparent and integrated lending solution, ensuring partners have access to financing when they need it most, whether for vehicle repairs, fuel, or unexpected expenses.

 

 Stefano Mazzaferro, Country Manager of inDrive in Brazil, added:

 “inDrive.Money goes beyond financial inclusion: it’s about offering, through our app, access to the right product at the right time. The initiative’s arrival in Brazil, a digitally advanced market, reinforces our purpose of fighting injustices and expanding the freedom of choice for partner drivers, offering a more financially advantageous alternative. Unlike credit card-based solutions, such as those offered in the market, our model operates with low-interest loans, representing an important differentiator in the country’s current mobility landscape.”

 Through the inDrive app, partners across Brazil can check available offers and apply for credit in just a few clicks. EmpreX manages the entire assessment process — from analysis to financing, including scoring, terms, and loans — with regulatory compliance supported by its partnership with BMP SCD, a licensed Brazilian financial institution. After the application, and based on the driver’s information and earnings history, EmpreX conducts a full assessment to verify that the candidate meets the required criteria.

 Initial operations show that drivers who accessed financing have become more engaged. Satisfaction is high: 86% said they would take out another loan if needed and are willing to recommend this solution. With inDrive.Money, the goal is to expand the product to all cities where the platform operates in Brazil. Currently, it is available in approximately 90 locations, including larger cities such as Manaus, Fortaleza, Salvador, Belo Horizonte, and Florianópolis, as well as mid-sized ones like Campinas and Marabá.

 

 Silvan Roth, CEO of EmpreX, said:

 “Brazil’s service providers power the country every day, but many are forced to resort to loans with exorbitant terms. By integrating EmpreX credit directly into the inDrive app, we’re transforming complex workflows into just a few taps, putting real working capital in the pockets of inDrive’s partner drivers and delivery people exactly when they need it. The integrated loan gives them freedom, flexibility, and the ability to stay on the road without interruption.”

 By incorporating financial services into its app in Brazil, inDrive continues to combat injustices and expand the freedom of drivers in the country, while strengthening financial inclusion and contributing to the national economy.
