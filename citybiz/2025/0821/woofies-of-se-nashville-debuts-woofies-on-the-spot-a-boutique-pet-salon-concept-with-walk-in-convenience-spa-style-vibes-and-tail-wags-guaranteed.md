# Woofie’s of SE Nashville Debuts “Woofie’s on the Spot”, A Boutique Pet Salon Concept with Walk-In Convenience, Spa-Style Vibes, and Tail Wags Guaranteed

After a year of bringing top-tier mobile grooming, dog walking, and pet sitting directly to local doorsteps, Woofie’s® of SE Nashville is unleashing its latest innovation: Woofie’s on the Spot — a boutique-style pet salon concept combining spa-worthy pampering with walk-in convenience for Nashville’s four-legged friends.

 Parked in the vibrant, dog-loving shopping district of The Nations (at 5704 Ohio Avenue), Woofie’s on the Spot offers everything from quick touch-ups (nail trims, blowouts, facials, and more) to full-on grooming glow-ups, all delivered in a calm, one-on-one setting that’s as relaxing for pets as it is for their humans. Clients can stroll the local shops, grab lunch, or hit the local dog bar while their pets enjoy a little “me time.”

 “We created Woofie’s on the Spot because our clients wanted the best of both worlds,” said Eric Wanner, local owner of Woofie’s of SE Nashville. “We’re proud to offer mobile pet care that comes to you — and now a central spot to drop in when you’re already out and about. Whether you’re swinging by for an express grooming service or booking a full spa experience, we’ve got you covered.”

 The new location expands on the business’s successful mobile service, which launched last year and quickly became a favorite among busy pet parents in metro Nashville and surrounding communities. Woofie’s of SE Nashville has already earned a 4.9-star Google rating with over 100 glowing reviews, thanks in large part to its skilled, AKC S.A.F.E.®-certified grooming team and a deep commitment to pet safety, care, and comfort.

 About the Owner

 Owner of Woofie’s of SE Nashville, including Woofie’s on the Spot, Eric Wanner, is a longtime Mt. Juliet resident, proud pet parent, and no stranger to entrepreneurship. With experience ranging from scrappy startups to Fortune 500 leadership roles, Eric brought Woofie’s to SE Nashville with a mission to combine his business savvy with his family’s love for animals. He shares his home with his twins Callaway and Channing, their five-year-old Cavapoo Cece, two tree frogs named Greenie and Deuce, and a leopard gecko named Lizzo.

 “Launching the first-of-its-kind Woofie’s on the Spot salon is a proud milestone,” says Eric. “We’ve seen incredible demand for pet services that feel both high-end and approachable. Through using resources and equipment already available to us, this new concept lets us meet pet parents where they are — whether that’s at home or out shopping with their pup.”

 Services Offered

 Woofie’s on the Spot offers both appointments and walk-ins, with a 30-minute pickup window and a firm commitment to personalized, one-on-one grooming care. Whether you’re stopping by for a glow-up or planning your pup’s next spa day, the Woofie’s team is ready to pamper your pet.

 The business is also actively hiring grooming and pet care professionals. Interested applicants can apply here.
