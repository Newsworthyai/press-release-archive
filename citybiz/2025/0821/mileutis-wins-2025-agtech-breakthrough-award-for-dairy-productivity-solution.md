 “This recognition is a milestone for Mileutis and a testament to the power of science-driven innovation in agriculture,” said David Javier Iscovich, CEO of Mileutis. “With IMILAC, we’re not only helping farmers produce more and better-quality milk, we’re also tackling the urgent global challenge of antimicrobial resistance. This award underscores the potential for solutions that benefit animal health, human health and the planet.”

 The AgTech Breakthrough Awards honor excellence and innovation across agricultural technology, recognizing companies and products that are transforming the industry through sustainable, impactful solutions.

 “IMILAC has more than a decade of research into naturally occurring milk peptides and their ability to activate the cow’s immune defenses,” added Dr. Jose Iscovich, Chief Scientific Officer at Mileutis. “By replacing antibiotics with a natural, residue-free solution, we can protect animal health, slow the spread of resistant bacteria and drive sustainability within the dairy industry – all without compromising productivity.”
