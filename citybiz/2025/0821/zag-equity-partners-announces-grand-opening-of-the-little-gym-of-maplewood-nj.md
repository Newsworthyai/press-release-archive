# ZAG Equity Partners Announces Grand Opening of The Little Gym of Maplewood, NJ

ZAG Equity Partners, a privately held investment firm focused on consumer, real estate, and fitness ventures, announced today the grand opening of The Little Gym of Maplewood, a best-in-class children’s enrichment and physical development center. The new location will officially open on September 15th, bringing world-class programming to families across Essex County.

 Located at 1807 Springfield Avenue, The Little Gym of Maplewood spans 4,000 square feet and is expected to create 10 new local jobs. Its programs are designed to be a springboard for life’s adventures—using movement-based learning, imaginative play, and hands-on instruction to help children build confidence, coordination, and social-emotional skills. Popular offerings include parent/child classes, enrichment programs for preschool and school-age children, and Awesome Birthday Bashes featuring themed activities and music-led fun.

 The location is owned and operated by ZAG Equity Partners, a private investment firm led by principals George and Andrea Wilson, longtime advocates for child development and community-rooted businesses. As parents and Essex County residents, the Wilsons saw firsthand the positive impact The Little Gym had on their own child. They recognized an opportunity and need to bring those same benefits to families in the Maplewood area.

 “At ZAG Equity Partners, we invest in mission-driven businesses that create lasting value for families and communities,” said George Wilson. “The Little Gym of Maplewood aligns perfectly with that vision—providing a nurturing, fun, and enriching environment that helps children grow physically, socially, and emotionally.”

 To oversee day-to-day operations, ZAG Equity Partners has selected Ashley Downey as General Manager of The Little Gym of Maplewood. Ashley brings deep experience in early childhood programming and team leadership and will be responsible for delivering the brand’s high standards of service, safety, and instruction. While Maplewood is the firm’s first Little Gym location, ZAG Equity Partners is actively evaluating opportunities to expand the brand’s presence throughout the region.

 The opening of The Little Gym of Maplewood marks a key milestone in ZAG Equity Partners’ commitment to building community-rooted businesses that improve the lives of families through thoughtful, high-quality offerings.
