# Brightview Senior Living Named to the 2025 PEOPLE Companies that Care List

Great Place To Work® and PEOPLE magazine have honored Brightview Senior Living as one of the 2025 PEOPLE® Companies that Care. This marks Brightview’s third time on the prestigious list, with the company climbing to No. 77, up four spots from its previous ranking of 81. Earning a spot means that Brightview Senior Living has surpassed rigorous benchmarks, establishing itself as one of the best companies to work for in the country.

 The PEOPLE Companies that Care list is based on over 1.3 million employee survey responses and data from companies representing the experience of more than 8.4 million employees. Of those surveys, more than 1 million responses came from employees at companies eligible for this year’s list, and these rankings are based on that feedback.

 “It is an honor for Brightview Senior Living to once again be recognized on the prestigious People Companies That Care® list,” shared Doug Dollenberg, President & CEO of Brightview Senior Living. “This award reflects the extraordinary commitment of our associates, who create a culture of warmth, hospitality, respect, and belonging for one another and for our residents. Caring for people is at the heart of everything we do, and I am incredibly proud of the way our team lives out our mission each day.”

 Companies also submit essays that are validated by employee survey data to give a complete picture of the way an organization cares for its employees, its community, and the planet. To be considered for the list, companies must be Great Place To Work Certified and have at least 10 U.S. employees.

 The Companies that Care list is highly competitive. Survey responses reflect a comprehensive picture of the workplace experience. Honorees were selected based on their ability to care for employees, families, and the communities where they operate.

 “Businesses are vital pillars in the communities where they operate,” says Michael C. Bush, CEO of Great Place To Work. “Caring for your people and your community isn’t something you do after you build a successful business; it’s how to make your business successful.”

 “Witnessing the innovative spirit with which these companies invest in their employees, communities, and the world is truly invigorating,” says Charlotte Triggs, PEOPLE GM and editor-in-chief. “Their commitment reflects our mission, to feature what happens when ordinary people do extraordinary work.”

 This award follows Brightview’s recent accolades: Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For® 2025; Best Independent Living, Assisted Living, and Memory Care by U.S. News and World Report (various communities) 2025, and Fortune Best Workplaces in Aging Services 2024.
