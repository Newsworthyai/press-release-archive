# Houston Area Women’s Center Opens One Safe Place Houston

The Houston Area Women’s Center) officially opened One Safe Place Houston, a transformational 5.5-acre campus designed to offer safety, dignity, and wraparound support to survivors of domestic and sexual violence and sex trafficking through comprehensive, trauma-informed services all in one location. The site brings together mission-driven partners who have thoughtfully shaped every element of the environment to reflect respect, resilience, and renewal.

 This new temporary supportive housing will triple HAWC’s capacity, increasing in phases – ultimately providing safety and support for up to 350 survivors. One Safe Place Houston isn’t just a facility – it’s a collective vision. One Safe Place Houston is a bold response to the urgent need for integrated, survivor-centered services in Houston. It is a place where healing is made possible not only through programs, but through architecture, design, and community investment.

 An Environment Built for Healing and Renewal

 The campus includes 135 supportive housing apartments for survivors and their families, alongside comprehensive on-site services such as behavioral health counseling, legal advocacy, medical forensic care, childcare, a Houston ISD elementary school, community gathering spaces, workforce readiness, and financial literacy programs – all within a highly secure, thoughtfully designed environment. At One Safe Place Houston, healing begins in one location supported by a coordinated and compassionate team.

 “Safety is the first step—but healing, empowerment, and rebuilding are what make lasting change possible,” said Sonia Corrales, Interim President & CEO at HAWC. “One Safe Place Houston reflects our community’s deep commitment to survivors and our collective belief that everyone deserves to heal with dignity.”

 Designed by GSMA Architects with Survivors in Mind

 GSMA Architects, a Houston-based architecture firm known for its civic and community-centered work, led the design of the campus. Their vision prioritized dignity, safety, and healing—transforming traditional shelter models into a restorative and empowering environment.

 From the earliest sketches to the final walkthroughs, GSMA Architects brought a deep intentionality to the design of One Safe Place Houston. Every apartment, corridor, and shared space was imagined in partnership with survivor advocates and frontline staff. The result: a trauma-informed, welcoming campus that balances privacy with connectivity and centers the dignity of every survivor.

 “Spaces tell stories,” said Ann Rosenwinkel, AIA, LEED BD&C. “This one tells survivors that they matter—that they are safe, supported, and surrounded by a community that sees their strength. We’re proud to help bring that message to life.”

 Furnished for Function, Comfort, and Respect by CORT Furniture Rental

 CORT Furniture Rental partnered with HAWC to furnish the entire campus, ensuring that every residential, counseling, and common area is equipped with high-quality, multi-functional furnishings that meet the needs of residents and staff alike. As a valued vendor, CORT’s contributions help make One Safe Place Houston feel like a home—not just a facility.

 “Our goal is to help create spaces that uplift and support people,” said Todd Shell, CORT National Director of Supportive Housing. “We’re honored to play a part in a project that will have such a lasting impact on families and on Houston as a whole.”

A Collective Investment in Houston’s Future

 One Safe Place Houston is a public commitment to the safety and wellbeing of survivors in our city. At a time when intimate partner violence and sexual assault remain deeply rooted public health and safety issues, this space offers a bold and coordinated response.

 Its creation reflects what’s possible when organizations, design experts, community partners, advocates, corporate and civic leaders, and community members come together – not just to build a shelter, but to build a future where one does not have to choose between silence and survival.

 “Thoughtful architecture and furniture design are not just aesthetic choices—they are part of a public health strategy that fosters safety, dignity, and healing for everyone who walks through the doors of One Safe Place Houston,” Corrales said.
