# Ace Pickleball Club to Open in Knoxville — Coming Soon

Ace Pickleball Club (APC), a rapidly expanding national pickleball franchise with a community-focused approach, is announcing the upcoming opening of its new location in Knoxville. Located at 11130 Kingston Pike, Suite 6, the new 47,000-square-foot club will feature 15 competition-sized courts and one dinking court, making it the largest climate-controlled indoor pickleball club in Tennessee. The club is expected to bring 10 new jobs to the local community and will cater to the growing demand for pickleball locally, offering Members the flexibility to play whenever their schedule allows for a flat monthly Membership fee.

 No more competing to reserve a spot or waiting in long lines for a chance to play – APC’s offering of open play all day, every day lets Members get their games in without the hassle of coordinating with others, or any additional fees.

 In appreciation of the Knoxville community, Ace Pickleball Club is excited to offer the first month of Membership for free leading up to its grand opening. Sign up for the email list to get notified once this offer launches.

 The Knoxville club will be brought to life by Don Jacobson III, a fourth-generation spring manufacturer and Robotics Teacher whose family business has been a cornerstone of American industry since 1890. A lifelong enthusiast of racquet sports, from tennis, racquetball, and paddle tennis to ping pong and squash, Don discovered a new passion in pickleball for its fast-paced play and inclusive spirit. What makes the sport especially meaningful to him is its ability to bring generations together. Whether rallying with his three kids or enjoying a match with his parents, pickleball has become a way for Don to stay active and connected with those he loves most.

 Don first visited Ace Pickleball Club’s Roswell location as a player, not an investor. After speaking with members about what they loved most, the welcoming atmosphere and ease of meeting new people, he felt inspired to open a club of his own.

 As a Robotics Teacher, Don’s passion for teaching and helping students grow aligns perfectly with Ace Pickleball Club’s motto: “Start now, play forever.” His vision for the Knoxville location is to create a space where families and friends can unplug, get active, and connect through one of America’s fastest-growing sports.

 “Bringing Ace Pickleball to Knoxville is about more than just opening a club,” said Don Jacobson III. “It is about creating a space where families like mine can connect, grow, and enjoy a healthy, active lifestyle together. Watching my children gain confidence and joy through pickleball has shown me the power of this sport to bring people closer together.”

 Ace Pickleball Club prioritizes its Members, delivering a seamless and optimal playing experience with state-of-the-art facilities and cushioned professional-grade courts. Unlike other Clubs, APC offers a simplified Membership model with a single monthly payment, like a traditional gym, to allow for a hassle-free experience for every age and skill level. At APC, Members become part of a fun and inclusive community filled with unlimited open play, clinics, Club-coordinated tournaments, social events, and court and ball machine reservations. With unlimited paddle demos included, Members can test out all the newest paddles from a wide variety of brands to find their favorite. New to the sport? Ace Pickleball Club – Knoxville will offer free introductory pickleball clinics to go over the rules of the sport and feel more comfortable as they learn about the game. Whether it is the calorie burn of a competitive match, or a lighthearted game with friends, APC has something for everyone.
