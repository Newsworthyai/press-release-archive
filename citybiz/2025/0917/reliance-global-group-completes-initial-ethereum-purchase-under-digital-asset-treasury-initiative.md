# Reliance Global Group Completes Initial Ethereum Purchase Under Digital Asset Treasury Initiative

Reliance Global Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: RELI) today announced that it has completed its first digital asset purchase under its recently launched Digital Asset Treasury initiative, acquiring Ethereum (ETH). The purchase represents the initial step in Reliance’s broader plan to build a diversified digital asset portfolio, with future investments expected to include leading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.

 The Company plans to fund these activities through a combination of cash reserves and other approved corporate financing tools. Reliance’s DAT initiative is structured to pursue long-term capital appreciation through blockchain-based participation.

 As part of this strategy, Reliance has also formed a dedicated Crypto Advisory Board (“CAB”) to guide management and the Board of Directors in the oversight, risk management, and execution of digital asset initiatives. The CAB will provide expertise on treasury management, blockchain integration, and governance practices critical to the Company’s expansion into digital assets.

 Ezra Beyman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Reliance Global Group, stated, “This first Ethereum transaction is an important milestone for Reliance as we expand into digital assets. It demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that our operational systems – covering custody, governance, accounting, and compliance – are equipped to support this strategy on a larger scale. Reliance expects to continue purchasing Ethereum and other digital assets in measured increments, applying a disciplined approach to capital allocation as the treasury position develops over time.”

 “Our entry into Ethereum underscores our conviction that blockchain technology is rapidly shaping the future of both finance and insurance. With the added oversight of our Crypto Advisory Board, we are confident this strategy provides shareholders with a forward-looking opportunity while maintaining our focus on responsible execution and risk management.”

 Reliance has a longstanding history of leveraging artificial intelligence, data mining, and innovative distribution models to deliver competitive, technology-enabled insurance solutions through RELI Exchange and 5MinuteInsure.com. By applying similar innovation to the blockchain ecosystem, the Company seeks to pioneer the convergence of InsurTech and decentralized finance.
