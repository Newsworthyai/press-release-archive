# Q&amp;A with Universal Parking’s Justin Kinsey: Tampa-St. Pete’s Evolving Parking Landscape

The Tampa-St. Petersburg metro area continues to experience steady growth and is consistently ranked among the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the United States. In addition, the region is a major tourism hub with the Tampa International Airport welcoming 23.9 million passengers in 2023, a 32% increase from 2021.

 Tampa is seeing an increase in new developments, with a wave of major projects underway and planned, including the construction of high-rise residential towers and luxury hotels. Projects like GasWorx, a six-million-square-foot mixed-use development, will add 1,250 residential units, 100,000 square feet of office space, and 105,000 square feet of retail space. With new developments like these, increased tourism and a growing demand for more intelligent infrastructure, parking has become a key piece of urban mobility in the region.

 We spoke with Justin Kinsey, Vice President of Operations at Universal Parking, to gain insight into how the Tampa-St. Pete area is adapting its parking strategies.

 What is the current parking landscape in the Tampa-St. Pete area?

 Tampa-St. Pete is a commuter-driven market. Public transit is improving with systems like SunRunner, the region’s first bus rapid transit line. However, most people continue to rely on personal vehicles, and access to convenient parking is crucial.

 Tampa’s growth in both population and tourism is putting increasing pressure on existing parking infrastructure in key areas, including downtown Tampa, Channelside, and St. Petersburg’s Central Avenue and EDGE District. Growth in these urban cores increases parking demand during workdays and events and drives challenges with both the perceived and actual availability of parking. Furthermore, weekend traffic surges near the beaches are common, increasing the need for flexible parking solutions.

 What trends are shaping parking in this region right now?

 There is certainly a shift away from traditional parking toward flexible and innovative parking solutions aimed at convenience for both parkers and garage and lot owners. We’re moving away from static parking solutions to more tech-driven solutions, such as mobile payment systems and dynamic pricing in garages and surface lots. We’re also seeing an increase in the use of license plate recognition (LPR) and real-time availability tracking. These tools not only make life easier for parkers, but they also give operators and property owners valuable data on usage patterns and turnover.

 Drivers don’t want to waste time finding available parking or dealing with faulty payment systems. The real-time technologies provide visibility into current parking availability, helping drivers reduce the time spent circling for a spot, while LPR systems make garage and lot access nearly seamless. Other parking apps enable drivers to locate, reserve and pay for parking spots from their phones.

 Can you tell me more about some of these technology solutions?

 The adoption of these smart parking solutions and the rise of app-based payment systems are helping to make parking more efficient. Still, parking solutions are not one-size-fits-all for businesses or parkers. Not every parker wants or is able to use an app. Additionally, some companies may not be able to afford the necessary infrastructure to support smart parking technology fully.

 Other issues with parking apps include connection problems in areas with poor cell service or mistakes, such as entering the wrong license plate or zone number, which can result in unnecessary fines. That said, parking apps tend to be most effective in urban areas because digital infrastructure is robust.

 What does the future of parking look like in this region?

 Automation and the use of technology will continue to grow, but despite these advances, the human element can still make a difference. In some instances, a more hybrid approach that integrates smart apps with staffed parking lots makes more sense. In a hybrid system, smart apps offer the real-time availability and contactless payment options that many parkers are seeking, while on-site staff can offer personal assistance to those who need it and an enhanced sense of security.

 Apps also provide key data insights on usage patterns, peak parking times, and durations to businesses and lot owners. This is especially helpful in areas with a high concentration of retail establishments or with high tourist traffic, but it can be implemented in any lot or garage. This model also empowers businesses to optimize parking turnover, implement dynamic pricing and create a safer and more reliable parking environment.

 Regardless of which path garage and lot owners take, it’s clear that the parking landscape will continue to grow and evolve.
