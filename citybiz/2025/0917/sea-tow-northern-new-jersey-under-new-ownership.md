# Sea Tow Northern New Jersey Under New Ownership

Sea Tow® Northern New Jersey, the premium on-water assistance provider in the area, is now operating under the new ownership of Captain Mike Dudzinski. Captain Dudzinski will oversee all aspects of the franchise operation and continue to serve the local boating community with the exceptional service they’ve come to know.

 Established in 1987, Sea Tow Northern New Jersey services the Sandy Hook and Metro New York areas, reaching as far north as the George Washington Bridge. To best serve members and boaters alike, the fleet of purpose-built boats are strategically positioned at Bakers Marina on the Bay.

 “I am proud to take the helm of Sea Tow Northern New Jersey,” said Captain Dudzinski. “I am committed to upholding the same dedication and delivering the highest standard of care and support to the boating community that has already been established, while making improvements when the opportunity permits.”

 With over 40+ years of experience in the marine industry and as a lifelong boat owner, Captain Dudzinski brings a well-rounded background that includes serving as a charter captain, marina employee and investor, and expert in marine electronics installation.

 “We’re thrilled to have Captain Dudzinski take the reins of Sea Tow Northern New Jersey,” said Sea Tow President Kristen Frohnhoefer. “We are confident that Northern New Jersey boaters can expect the same exceptional service they’ve always relied on for all their on-water assistance needs.”

 Sea Tow membership benefits include unlimited boat towing with no distance or dollar limits in a member’s home area, fuel delivery, jump starts, covered ungroundings, scheduled dock-to-dock towing coverage on all their covered vessels, and members always get priority over non-members – 24/7. Additional marine services available outside of membership include salvage and recovery.
