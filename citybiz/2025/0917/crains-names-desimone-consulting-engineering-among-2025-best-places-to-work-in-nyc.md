# Crain’s Names DeSimone Consulting Engineering Among 2025 Best Places to Work in NYC

Prestigious business publication celebrates companies who’ve made superior efforts to support and value employees

 DeSimone Consulting Engineering has again earned a spot on the Crain’s New York Business’ list of the 2025 Best Places to Work in New York City, marking a second consecutive year of recognition for its commitment to cultivating an inspiring, people-first workplace culture at its global headquarters.

 “These companies have gone the distance in creating an atmosphere of collegiality, collaboration and caring, whether assigning a mentor to ease each new hire’s transition into the fold, offering paid time off for volunteer work, empowering employees to turn their ideas into projects, or hosting company getaways,” said Crain’s, which partnered with Workforce Research Group to conduct anonymous employee surveys to evaluate firms across the city.

 DeSimone’s New York team members celebrated the company’s commitment to a first-class workplace, particularly its support of innovation and inclusion. Significantly, nearly every surveyed DeSimone employee in its New York office (94%) expressed pride in being part of a company whose reputation, projects, and values align with their own, and celebrated being part of a team with a common purpose.

 A full 98% of teammates reported understanding how their efforts impact organizational success, making them more motivated to contribute to meaningful work. Meanwhile, 97% of DeSimone staff said they go above and beyond for the company—reflecting the value and support of strong leadership.

 Stephen V. DeSimone, Chairman and CEO, said, “It is a tremendous honor to see our people affirm the values we live by every day. When our people feel supported, respected, and inspired, the projects we deliver for our clients exceed their expectations in terms of technical innovation and efficient delivery.”

 Founded in New York City in 1969, DeSimone has grown from a single NYC office into a global engineering leader with 19 offices across four continents. DeSimone provides a comprehensive suite of services, including structural engineering, façade and building envelope consulting, vertical transportation, structural detailing, tilt-up design, wind engineering and vibration analysis, and advisory services, including dispute resolution.

 DeSimone’s New York-based engineers have played a pivotal role in transforming landmark properties, including the office-to-residential conversion of the historic One Wall Street, and reimagining the 19th-century, industrial Terminal Warehouse into a modern, 1.2-million-square-foot, mixed-use office complex. As structural engineer for the revitalization of One Times Square, DeSimone designed a dramatic new cantilevered observation deck and new curtain wall, which will be in place for the 2025 New Year’s Eve ball drop.

 Like its overarching business strategy, DeSimone’s workplace culture emphasizes growth and resilience. The firm hosts regular town halls and in-house seminars, offers tuition reimbursement and hybrid work options, and invests in wellness initiatives and team-building gatherings and charitable projects to ensure employees feel valued and connected.

 The Crain’s honor joins a growing list of accolades earned by DeSimone in 2025, including Top Workplace recognition from USA Today, The Sunday Times of London, the South Florida Sun Sentinel, and the Miami Herald. Over the past five years, DeSimone has expanded its global workforce from 250 to some 600 professionals, adding offices in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and South America, and acquiring a number of specialized companies to augment service options for their clients.
