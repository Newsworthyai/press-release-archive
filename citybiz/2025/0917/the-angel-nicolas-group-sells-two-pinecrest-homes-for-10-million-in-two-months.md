# The Angel Nicolas Group Sells Two Pinecrest Homes for $10 Million in Two Months

The Nicolas Group at SERHANT continues to cement its reputation in Pinecrest as one of the top real estate groups in the market, closing two $10 million transactions in just two months.

 The milestone comes shortly after Angel Nicolas, one of Miami’s most accomplished agents, announced his move to SERHANT, the tech-powered real estate firm at the intersection of real estate, media, and education. With nearly $2 billion in career sales and more than $200 million closed in the past year alone, Nicolas has built a record of success across some of Miami’s most exclusive neighborhoods.

 The latest sale at 8825 SW 64th Court traded for $10 million, with Nicolas and Ale Alfonso representing both buyer and seller. The gated North Pinecrest estate sits on a 50,529-square-foot lot and offers eight bedrooms, nine and a half bathrooms, a theater, gym, office, three-car garage, and double carport. A grand coral stone entrance with dual water features leads into the space, with rich Peruvian teak wood accents warming the soaring ceilings and an Italkraft kitchen with Wolf appliances anchoring the interiors. Custom MiaCucina closets and vanities, a glass-enclosed wine display, a full-house generator, and a Control4 automation system, resort-style pool, summer kitchen, and gazebo add to the property’s features.

 5796 SW 91st Street, developed by Urbane Miami, also closed for $10 million with Nicolas representing the seller. The two-story corner estate spans 11,557-square feet, with 9,357-square feet of living space on nearly an acre. The residence offers seven bedrooms, eight full bathrooms, two powder rooms, a media room, office, and gym, with refined details such as an artisan floating staircase, hand-pressed terrazzo, and a double primary closet. A separate guest house, service quarters, dual laundry rooms, and an outdoor retreat with a heated saltwater pool, spa, and summer kitchen.

 Known for its oversized lots, prestigious schools, and lush tree-lined streets, Pinecrest has become one of the most popular luxury enclaves in Miami, attracting high-net-worth buyers seeking privacy alongside proximity to the city’s urban core. The back-to-back $10 million sales highlight both The Nicolas Group’s dominance in the market and Pinecrest’s emergence as a powerhouse in Miami’s luxury real estate scene.
