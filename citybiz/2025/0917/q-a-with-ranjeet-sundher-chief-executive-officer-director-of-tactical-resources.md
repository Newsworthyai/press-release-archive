# Q&amp;A with Ranjeet Sundher, Chief Executive Officer &amp; Director of Tactical Resources

Ranjeet Sundger is Chief Executive Officer of Tactical Resources, a mineral exploration and development company focused on U.S.-made rare earth elements used in semiconductors, electric vehicles, advanced robotics, and national defense. He has guided the company through a series of strategic milestones aimed at accelerating production and strengthening supply chain sovereignty for the U.S. REE market.

 With decades of experience in capital markets and building companies across resources, mining, and technology, Ranjeet Sundher is leading Tactical Resources at a pivotal moment for North American rare earths. Under his leadership, the company has advanced its flagship Peak Project in Texas, executed a business combination agreement to pursue a Nasdaq listing, and positioned itself as a key player in strengthening U.S. supply chain independence. In the following conversation with CityBiz, Sundher shares how Tactical Resources is approaching the rare earths opportunity, what makes the Peak Project unique, and why the sector is drawing so much attention from industry and government alike.

 Rare earths have made a ton of headlines this year, but before we discuss the big picture, can you give us an overview of Tactical Resources?

 Tactical Resources is addressing a critical need for domestic rare earth element (REE) production in North America. We are a North American REEs exploration and development company focused on American assets for American supply and American production. A key advantage for us in the race to build an integrated American rare earths supply chain is that we have exclusive rights to rare earth materials contained within the Peak Project, which is an existing operational mine in Texas and one of only a few rare, hard rock, direct-leach-extractable rare earth projects in the world.

 When we founded Tactical Resources, we established three core pillars that we track against each and every day. First and foremost, focus on American assets for American supply and American production. Second, target advanced assets that have the optionality to potentially fast track production and that have inherent cost benefits. Lastly, and arguably most importantly, we wanted to be focused on targeting projects that lend themselves to clean processing. We believe the Peak Project checks all these boxes.

 Can you tell our readers more about the Peak Project and what makes it so unique?

 The Peak Project is a rare earths focused project strategically located southeast of El Paso, Texas, with established existing and advanced permitting already in place. It’s a fully operational mine which supports our growth strategy and improves our ability to quickly operationalize. It has proven REEs enriched tailings already extracted and, as mentioned, it is one of only a few rare earth hard rock direct-leach-extractable projects in the world. Being a direct-leach-extractable project enhances our ability to bypass a lot of extra processing steps as nature does a significant amount of the heavy lifting for us. This helps with go-to-market speeds and costs.

 Furthermore, the Peak Project benefits from extensive existing infrastructure, including highway and rail access, which reduces development costs and time for production as compared to greenfield projects. As the Sierra Blanca Quarry has already been operating the mine for many years, as part of their processing operations, they have generated a significant amount of byproduct stockpile that we believe we can convert into valuable rare earth material. We believe that this stockpiled byproduct material will give us a head start once we get our rare earth extraction facility set up.

 Can you share some exciting milestones that you have achieved at Tactical Resources?

 Yes, absolutely. When Tactical Resources secured our strategic agreement with the Sierra Blanca Quarry, the current owner of the Peak Project, that was certainly a key milestone that established the framework for our ability to tap into the potential of the Peak Project as a rare earth asset. We also continue to make technical progress as we advance our development strategy. Importantly, we signed a business combination agreement with Plum Acquisition Corp. III to enable Tactical Resources’ next stage of growth through a Nasdaq listing and access to additional capital raising opportunities. Since signing the business combination agreement, we have continued to make progress towards closing, and we believe this transformative U.S. public markets transaction positions Tactical Resources to be taken to new heights.

 Let’s touch on the macro picture. Rare earths are in the spotlight this year, in your view, why are they so important?

 The bottom line is that rare earths are indispensable. They exhibit unique electromagnetic properties that make numerous technologies function such as smartphones, electric vehicles, artificial intelligence, humanoid robotics, advanced defense systems, and more. However, Chinese-controlled supply chains and dominance in this sector creates potential vulnerabilities for Western supply chains and interests, including national defense interests and geopolitical leverage.

 This perfect storm of both commercial and government demand for rare earths has given the 17 REEs their time to shine. The attention is well deserved.

 It seems as though the U.S. government is keen on rare earths. Why do you think that is?

 As mentioned, Chinese suppliers have a stranglehold on the rare earths supply chain. They have been focused on rare earths for decades, long before the rest of the world got involved. The U.S. government seems to understand this and the risks of having a rare earth supply chain completely reliant on one country.

 The most immediate challenge for REEs production outside of China is limited processing and refining capacity. In addition, North American players face difficulties in going to market at prices comparable to Chinese suppliers.

 Through public-private partnerships, funding and strategic pricing strategies, we believe the U.S. government is providing the right kind of support that can help build a robust American rare earths supply chain.

 Looking ahead, what’s next for Tactical Resources? What are you most excited about in the coming year?

 We are very excited about the opportunities ahead for Tactical Resources for the remainder of 2025, in 2026 and beyond. In the near-term, we believe that our Nasdaq listing will enable the next stage of our development strategy. In the mid-term, following the Nasdaq listing, we will be focused on pilot testing, flowsheet optimization and completing key economic and technical studies. In the long term, we plan to construct and commercialize a rare earth extraction facility at the Peak Project.

 We believe that Tactical Resources has the right go-to-market plan in place and, combined with our advanced and differentiated Peak Project, we believe that we are in a strong position to capitalize on the immense opportunities ahead.
