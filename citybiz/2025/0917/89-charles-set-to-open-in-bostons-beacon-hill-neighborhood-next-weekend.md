# 89 Charles Set to Open in Boston’s Beacon Hill Neighborhood Next Weekend

Ready to redefine the cocktail lounge experience, 89 Charles promises a refined hideaway with charm and inventive cocktails

 A new chapter in Boston’s cocktail scene will unfold when 89 Charles opens its doors in Boston’s historic Beacon Hill neighborhood on Saturday, September 20, 2025, offering a curated experience for those who appreciate the art of mixology, high-end wines and locally produced spirits.

 89 Charles is a small, intimate cocktail bar located on the street that bears its name, evoking the spirit of a refined hideaway, channeling the elegance of the Gatsby era with a foundation in Art Deco design. The intimate space features a 12-seat bar and a 30-seat lounge, wrapped in antique brass, rich blues, and curated vintage accents – blending Beacon Hill’s historic charm with a modern sense of glamour. Designed by the team at Assembly Designes, 89 Charles is a warm and welcoming sanctuary, perfect for unwinding after work, rendezvous, first dates and gatherings with old friends.

 Developed by 89 Charles’ Bar Manager, Dave Irwin, the retro themed bar program will center around classic reimaginings and rotating seasonally driven cocktails, a limited meticulously selected bottle list of vintage champagne and scarce high-end wines, as well as a small beer and wine by-the-glass selection. Irwin was previously at Zurito, also in Beacon Hill, with stops at Row 34 and Porto prior. The cocktails will be complemented by a small menu of elevated small plates, designed to offer bites that pair well with the cocktails, with Chef Matt McPherson at the helm.

 “Beacon Hill has always been a place where history meets charm, and we wanted to create a space that reflects that spirit,” said Gennaro Riccio, Owner of 89 Charles. “Our goal was to build an intimate bar, with a heavy emphasis on the art of cocktail making, that feels like it’s been a fabric of the neighborhood forever. With our unwavering focus on the development of the cocktail program and the overall lounge experience, we accomplished just that.”

 Reservations are available, and highly recommended, by visiting the Resy link at www.89charles.com. Walk-ins will be accepted at the bar. Hours of operation are Tuesday through Saturday from 5:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. For more information, please visit www.89charles.com and @89charlesbar on Instagram.
