# State Roundup: Trump Admin Officially Asks Judge To Vacate Wind Farm Permit; Bay Cleanup Takes Different Tact On Farm Nitrogen Use

TRUMP ADMIN ASKS JUDGE TO VACATE WIND FARM PERMIT OFF OCEAN CITY: The Trump administration officially asked a judge to vacate a crucial federal permit issued for the wind farm proposed off the coast of Ocean City. The move was expected, originally signaled by Justice Department attorneys in late August, but Friday’s filing provided more details on the government’s justification for reconsidering the project’s “construction and operations plan” that was approved late in President Joe Biden’s presidency. Christine Condon/Maryland Matters.

 REWARDING FARMS USING NITROGEN EFFICIENTLY SEEN AS BAY AID: The Nature Conservancy is testing a program that rewards farmers for getting their crops to use nitrogen more efficiently, rather than strictly focusing on using less of it. For decades, efforts to clean the Chesapeake Bay have tried to reduce nutrient-lade runoff from croplands by urging farmers to apply fewer nutrients to their fields. But those nutrients, especially nitrogen, are closely linked to crop productivity and therefore to a farm’s bottom line. Karl Blankenship of the Chesapeake Bay Journal/MarylandReporter.

 LANDFILL SEEKS TO DOUBLE ITS DUMP OF ‘TRASH JUICE’ INTO RIVER: The Days Cove Rubble Landfill, located on a peninsula in White Marsh, has applied for a permit, now under state review, to dump as much as 25,000 gallons of its toxic ‘trash juice each day into the Bird River, a tributary of the Gunpowder River. Generations of Baltimore County families have used the area for swimming, fishing and crabbing. Sapna Bansil/The Baltimore Banner.

 HARPERS FERRY AMONG NATIONAL PARKS FLAGGED FOR HISTORY SCRUBBING: At Harpers Ferry in Western Maryland, staff flagged more than 30 signs, according to both documents and a person familiar with the matter that highlight information potentially in violation of Trump’s policy. Interior Department officials then issued policies ordering agency employees to report any information, including signage and gift shop items, that might be out of compliance. They include signs referring to racial discrimination and the hostility of White people to those formerly enslaved. Jake Spring and Hannah Natanson/The Washington Post.

 COLUMN: MARYLAND NEEDS TO BAND WITH NEARBY STATES FOR OUR HEALTH: In the Northeast, nine states have joined to save common-sense safeguards against infectious disease with vaccines. On the West Coast, California, Oregon and Washington have created a similar compact, sharing resources and surveillance. Maryland has yet to join one of these partnerships, but the idea is under discussion. It should be. Rick Hutzell/The Baltimore Banner.

 MARYLAND HEALTH POLICE CAPT CHARGED WITH THEFT, MISCONDUCT: A Maryland Health Department Police captain faces criminal charges, including theft and two counts of misconduct in office, related to college classes she attended when she was supposed to be working. Bryan Sears/Maryland Matters.

 BA CO COUNCIL APPROVES NEW MAPS: The Baltimore County Council on Monday night voted 5 to 2 to approve a redistricting map that gives Maryland’s third-largest county more opportunity to represent its diverse population, with two Black-majority districts and one majority-minority district hugging the county’s west side. Rona Kobell/The Baltimore Banner.

 * The redistricting legislation followed more substantial changes from Council Chair Mike Ertel and Councilman Izzy Patoka, both Democrats who voted to approve the modified map. All three Republicans on the council — Wade Kach, David Marks and Todd Crandell — also voted in favor of the map. Natalie Jones/The Baltimore Sun.

 ‘PANDEMIC BABIES’ NOW IN SCHOOL; HOW ARE THEY DOING? Tens of thousands of Maryland kids whose most formative years were shaped by the pandemic and are now entering pre-K 4 and kindergarten classrooms. As in every other year, kids will come to school with varying early learning experiences, which can impact their adjustment to the classroom. Maya Lora/The Baltimore Banner.

 B’MORE URGES STATE TO BOOST AMBITIOUS TRANSPORTATION PLAN: Baltimore lawmakers and local advocates spoke with a unified voice Monday, urging state officials to act on several city transportation priorities, including an ambitious, $1.1 billion proposal to expand Maryland Transit Administration bus service.

Lee O. Sanderlin/The Baltimore Banner.

 PAUSE IN J-1 VISA PROGRAM WORRIES SHORE RESTAURANT OWNERS: Every year, thousands of international students arrive in Ocean City to work temporarily as J-1 visa holders. The Maryland Restaurant Association estimates that the resort town sees 3,300 of them, helping to fill more than 12,000 seasonal positions, mostly in Ocean City’s small businesses. But a pause of the J-1 visa program earlier this year — and a federal investigation into it amid efforts to secure U.S. borders — has complicated this summer’s restaurant season. Jane Godiner/The Baltimore Sun.

 DESCENDANTS OF ENSLAVED MAN, S. MARYLAND ESTATE OWNER SEARCH FOR HISTORY: Gwen Bankins, 61, stood in a hot, cramped cabin in Southern Maryland. Nearly 180 years ago, her great-great-grandfather was sold on an auction block. The price: $600. A few feet from her in the cabin, stood John Briscoe Jr., 64, whose great-great-grandfather had owned the estate and the enslaved people who worked and lived on the grounds. The two came together to help archaeologists from St. Mary’s College of Maryland and volunteers dig and sift through buckets of soil from a hole in the cabin’s dirt floor, seeking bits of artifacts that would offer clues about what life had been like for those who lived there and shed light on the region’s history. Dana Hedgpeth/The Washington Post.

 BALTIMORE BANNER TO OPEN LARGE MONTGOMERY BUREAU: The Baltimore Banner, which launched in 2022 with the goal of becoming Maryland’s most essential news organization, is readying a significant expansion into Montgomery County, where it is building a news bureau with about nine journalists in the Washington suburbs.
