# Boca Raton Historical Society Celebrates Another Sold-Out Toasts, Tastes &amp; Trolleys

The Boca Raton Historical Society (BRHS) once again delighted guests with its signature sold-out soirée, Toasts, Tastes & Trolleys on Friday, September 12, treating supporters to an unforgettable evening of culinary stops, historic landmarks, and behind-the-scenes experiences throughout Boca Raton and beyond.

 “This event reflects everything we love about Boca — community, culture, and curiosity,” said Dawn Zook, Committee Chair. “It’s a joy to connect our guests with the hidden gems and rich history all around them.”

 The progressive tour kicked off in style at The Boca Raton, where guests gathered for a lively welcome reception before boarding a colorful fleet of vintage Molly’s Trolleys. Each group set off on its own curated route, visiting an exclusive lineup of five unique destinations — from rarely seen executive suites to beloved historic sites — while enjoying wine, beer, and light bites along the way.

 As an early highlight of the evening, the first two trolleys were greeted at FAU Stadium by Adam Hasner, President of Florida Atlantic University, who welcomed guests to the exclusive President’s Box overlooking the field — a rare glimpse behind the scenes at one of the city’s most iconic institutions.

 At each stop, volunteer guides and BRHS committee members shared the rich stories behind the locations, highlighting their role in shaping Boca Raton’s history and future. Tourgoers experienced everything from the striking new offices of Paradise Bank, to the grand lobby and Monkey Bar at the oceanfront Opal Grand Resort & Spa in Delray Beach, to the sleek Japanese restaurant Kasumi inside the waterfront Waterstone Resort & Marina.

 A nostalgic highlight included a stop at City of Boca Raton Fire Station #3, where guests were greeted by retired Fire Chief Tom Wood and the city’s original 1925 fire engine, “Old Betsy.” Many attendees snapped selfies beside the station’s historical marker, installed last year through BRHS efforts.

 Led by Zook, the event’s powerhouse committee, including Laura Malone, Lauri Saunders, Ashley Huxhold, Reilly Glasser, Milena DeLuca, Karen Larkan, Roxana Garciga, Andrea Chang, Erika Merano, longtime Executive Director Mary Csar, and BRHS Board President, Denise Alman, made the event seamless.

 This year’s sponsors included event host and sponsor The Boca Raton; trolley sponsors Morgan Stanley Harbor Financial, Berman Law Group, Fairman & Associates Inc., Joni Goldberg & Al Goldberg, Premier Estates Properties, and Red Reef Advisors; and beverage sponsor Republic National Distributing Company.

 Proceeds from Toasts, Tastes & Trolleys benefit the Boca Raton Historical Society’s mission to preserve and share the city’s history through exhibits, programs, and educational outreach.
