# Q&amp;A with Dr. Vincent Candrawinata, Founder of Vincent+: Reversing Ozempic Face

The rise of GLP-1 receptor agonists like Ozempic has transformed weight loss and diabetes management, offering life-changing benefits for millions. However, an unintended side effect dubbed “Ozempic face”—marked by sagging skin, volume loss, and premature aging—has sparked concern. While often dismissed as a cosmetic issue, this phenomenon reflects deeper cellular health challenges.

 In this Q&A, Dr. Vincent Candrawinata, founder of activated phenolics skincare and supplement company Vincent+, explores why Ozempic face matters and how his innovative antioxidant solutions address it from the inside out.

 Dr. Vincent, what exactly is Ozempic face, and why should we care about it?

 Ozempic face refers to the gaunt, sagging appearance some people develop after rapid weight loss from GLP-1 injections like Ozempic or Mounjaro. It’s characterized by reduced facial fat, wrinkles, and drooping skin. On the surface, it seems like a vanity issue, but it’s a visible sign of deeper problems.

 Rapid weight loss depletes subcutaneous fat and stresses the body, causing systemic inflammation, muscle loss, and weakened skin structure. This is essentially your body “rotting from the inside out.” For younger patients with decades ahead, this could signal long-term cellular health issues that go beyond aesthetics.

 Why do conventional treatments like fillers or facelifts fall short in addressing Ozempic face?

 Cosmetic fixes like dermal fillers or facelifts are like patching a crumbling house—they improve the facade but don’t address the structural damage. These treatments can’t fix the underlying issues of inflammation, nutrient depletion, or loss of skin elasticity. For example, many focus on collagen supplements, but collagen alone, without elastin for elasticity, can exacerbate drooping. Imagine a balloon with mass but no bounce—it sags.

 Over-relying on fillers can even pull the skin downward over time, worsening the problem. We need solutions that tackle the root causes, not just the symptoms.

 You’ve mentioned cellular health as a key factor. How does rapid weight loss impact cells?

 Rapid weight loss, like that induced by Ozempic, starves cells of nutrients, impairing their ability to repair and regenerate. This triggers a domino effect of systemic inflammation, which further damages tissues. The skin, as the body’s largest organ, reflects this internal chaos through sagging and loss of glow. Additionally, glycation—where structural proteins become brittle—weakens the skin’s scaffolding.

 Combined with muscle and volume loss, this creates a “winning combination for aging,” contradicting the longevity goals many patients have. Addressing cellular integrity is critical to reversing these effects.

 How do Vincent+’s activated phenolics address these cellular issues?

 Our activated phenolics, derived from apples, are ultra-potent antioxidants developed through patented, peer-reviewed technology at Renovatio Bioscience. They work in three key ways.

 First, they reduce systemic inflammation caused by rapid weight loss, calming the body’s stress response. Second, they enhance nutrient uptake at the cellular level, giving cells the tools to repair and regenerate. Third, our serum delivers these actives deep into the skin, unlike typical skincare that sits on the surface.

 This repairs the skin’s scaffolding, restores hydration, and enhances glow, addressing Ozempic face from the inside out.

 You’ve emphasized the importance of elastin alongside collagen. Can you explain why this matters for Ozempic face?

 Collagen and elastin are the soft connective tissues that keep skin plump and youthful. Collagen provides structure, but elastin gives the bounce and elasticity that prevent sagging. Many focus solely on collagen, thinking it’s a cure-all, but without elastin, extra volume can weigh down the skin, worsening droopiness.

 Our Vincent+ serum and An Apple A Day tablets support both by reducing inflammation and promoting nutrient delivery, helping skin regain its anti-gravity effect. This balance is crucial for restoring a youthful appearance naturally.

 How does your approach differ from typical skincare products?

 Most skincare products, even expensive ones, only work on the skin’s top layer—about as effective as cooking oil. Our serum, backed by clinical formulation, penetrates deep to repair the skin’s structure.

 Meanwhile, our An Apple A Day tablets support cellular health systemically, ensuring the body’s inflammation levels are managed. This inside-out approach recognizes that skin health starts with a healthy body. You can’t just treat Ozempic face externally; you need to address the internal chaos to help skin recover, regenerate, and protect itself.

 What’s your advice for Ozempic users concerned about these side effects?

 Ozempic has improved many lives, but health shouldn’t come at a cost. To counter Ozempic face, prioritize cellular health alongside weight loss. Incorporate our Vincent+ serum into your routine—it’s an easy addition that supercharges existing skincare.

 Pair it with our An Apple A Day tablets to support internal health. These steps reduce inflammation, enhance nutrient uptake, and rebuild skin structure, aligning with longevity goals. By addressing the root causes, you can maintain vitality and appearance without compromising either.

 Any final thoughts on the broader implications of Ozempic face?

 Ozempic face is a wake-up call to look beyond weight loss numbers and consider whole-body health. It’s not just about looking good but feeling good for decades to come.

 Our activated phenolics offer a science-backed way to support cellular health, ensuring that transformative treatments like Ozempic enhance life without unintended consequences. Let’s redefine health interventions to prioritize both internal vitality and external radiance.
