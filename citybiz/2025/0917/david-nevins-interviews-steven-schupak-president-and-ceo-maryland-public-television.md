 After becoming the network’s chief operating officer in 2014, he was named station manager in 2021. This promotion recognized an expansion of his planning, content, operations, and financial oversight responsibilities, his leadership in growing MPT’s position as a digital content provider, and his creating and overseeing of MPT’s Maryland State Ad Agency division.

He later served as production manager for the 1986 Liberty Weekend Statue of Liberty Celebration.

 He is an alumnus of the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University where he earned a bachelor’s degree in film and television. He also holds a master’s degree in marketing from the Graduate School of Management & Technology at the University of Maryland Global Campus (UMGC) and was honored with its Distinguished Alumnus Award in 2019, the highest alumni award bestowed at UMGC.

 The National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences’ National Capital Chesapeake Bay Chapter inducted Mr. Schupak into its prestigious Silver Circle in 2020 in recognition of his contributions to the broadcast industry for 25 years or more.
