# Patients Want Easy Access to Dental Records, Survey Finds

The vast majority (82.34%)* of dental patients believe it is important or very important that their information, such as records and x-rays, is easily shared between dental providers, according to a new survey from Vyne Dental®, a leading provider of dental revenue technologies and health information exchange solutions.

 The 300-patient survey also revealed that half (50.3%) of patients have had to repeat dental tests or x-rays because their new dentist did not have access to their previous records.

 The survey highlighting dental patients’ demand for seamless record-sharing between providers comes as pressure builds on the dental industry to make greater progress toward “open data,” which refers to information that can be freely accessed, used, and shared across platforms without restrictive barriers.

 Although the medical industry has advanced open data by adopting a new interoperability framework to support seamless exchange across providers, EHRs, and tech platforms, the dental industry has largely lagged in reaching this critical goal.

 “The dental industry must strive to make greater progress toward open data for one simple reason: It benefits patients and providers,” said Vyne CRO Nick Rodich. “When dentists freely share patient data, they gain critical insights that inform treatment decisions and improve outcomes. Patients are empowered to take ownership in their care and can avoid costly, invasive and unnecessary repeat procedures when they have access to their records.”

 Additional key findings of the survey include:

 * A large majority (79%) of patients say that it is important that their dental records are portable, which enables patients to easily change dentists without losing critical information.
* Slightly less than half (43.7%) of patients say that it is difficult or very difficult to access dental information, such as test results and x-rays.
* The majority (64.3%) of patients are unfamiliar with the term “interoperability.”

 The survey of 300 dental patients was conducted on behalf of Vyne Dental in September.
