# Statement on Caesars Palace Times Square Casino Community Advisory Committee Vote

This morning, the Community Advisory Committee overseeing the proposed Times Square casino voted against the project. In response to today’s vote, Jason Laks, President of The Broadway League and member of the No Times Square Casino Coalition, issued the following statement.

 “This was a vote to protect the magic of Broadway for the one hundred thousand New Yorkers who depend on it for their livelihoods, and for the tens of millions who come from around the world to experience it. A casino can go anywhere, but Broadway only lives here. We are so filled with gratitude for the committee members and the local elected officials—State Senator Liz Krueger, Assembly Member Tony Simone, Borough President Mark Levine and Council Member Erik Bottcher—who looked at the facts, listened to the residents, and stood up for this neighborhood and the theater community.”

 According to a poll released just last week, 67% of registered voters who live in Midtown and on the West Side opposed the proposed Times Square casino.

 The No Times Square Casino Coalition is a grassroots campaign that has grown to more than 35 organizations, including IATSE—the largest union on Broadway representing 7 locals and 168,000 workers across North America—the United Federation of Teachers, social service providers like the Ali Forney Center and Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, as well as resident groups like the Hell’s Kitchen Neighborhood Association and Westside Neighborhood Alliance.
