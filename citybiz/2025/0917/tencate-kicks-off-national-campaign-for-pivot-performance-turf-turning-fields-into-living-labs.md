# TenCate Kicks Off National Campaign for Pivot Performance Turf, Turning Fields into ‘Living Labs’

On the field and online, coaches, ADs and architects get to experience firsthand how the next generation of turf plays like natural grass

 TenCate, the global leader in synthetic turf innovation, is kicking off a national campaign with a bold invitation: Try the future of sports turf for yourself.

 At the center of the multipronged initiative are “Pivot Field Days,” unique hands-on events that bring athletic directors, coaches, athletes, architects and municipal decision-makers to local sports fields to experience Pivot® Performance Turf firsthand.

 The interactive events are designed to introduce the nation to Pivot, the first synthetic turf that replicates the feel and performance of natural grass without the drawbacks of traditional turf. Each event transforms a local field into a living lab, letting guests step onto the turf and watch its performance revealed by biometric sensors tracking an athlete’s every step, turn and pivot.

 TenCate debuted the first “Field Day” this month at 3&2 Baseball Club in Lenexa, Kan., where coaches, athletic directors and others took the field to experience Pivot in action. At the same time, a TenCate team member wore biosensors that captured real-time data, confirming what participants experienced for themselves: Pivot delivers the performance of natural grass.

 “For athletic directors, coaches and other decision-makers, being able to see and experience the performance firsthand is invaluable,” said Dr. Colin Young, Global Director of R&D at TenCate. “It confirmed that Pivot plays like grass, with data to match the experience.”

 Charlie Beets, League and Tournament Director of 3&2 Baseball Club, called Pivot “a gamechanger” for the complex, adding that the turf still looks new a year after installation.

 “We have more than 6,000 kids in our program and host over 3,000 tournament teams a year,” Beets said. “The turf has been a real differentiator in attracting teams from across the region.”

 The Field Day experience is just one element of TenCate’s broader campaign. It also features digital education and national advertising, reaching coaches, athletic directors, athletes, architects and municipal leaders across the country.

 “Pivot gives athletes the performance they want and sports facilities the reliability they need,” said Joe Fields, President and CEO of TenCate Americas. “This campaign allows coaches, athletic directors and decision-makers to see Pivot’s many advantages for themselves.”

 TenCate’s initiative includes the expansion of the Playing for Keeps website, a digital hub that helps coaches, athletic directors and municipal planners explore Pivot’s performance and learn more about synthetic turf. The comprehensive site features side-by-side comparisons with conventional turf, product overviews with specs and warranty details, and case studies from schools and universities. Visitors also will find plain-language explainers, myth-versus-fact resources, and testimonials from coaches and athletes who have competed on Pivot fields.

 Together, the site provides the data, context and real-world examples facility leaders need to review the technology with confidence.

 “Playing for Keeps gives athletic directors and coaches all the information they need in one place,” Fields said. “From data and visuals to testimonials and case studies, it makes evaluating Pivot easier than ever.”

 Developed by TenCate’s Center for Turf Innovation, Pivot represents years of research and development to create a synthetic turf that plays and performs like natural grass. Key features include:

 * No performance infill required, reducing plastic shedding by up to 99%
* No black rubber pellets
* Up to 50% longer lifespan than conventional turf systems
* Higher fiber density, creating a more grass-like surface
* Backed by an industry-first 12-year warranty
* Zero detectable PAHs or lead, meeting California Prop 65 requirements and FIFA, NCAA and NFL testing criteria
* Regionally recyclable at the end of its life

 With the new efforts, TenCate is aiming to redefine expectations for synthetic turf.

 “Pivot represents a leap forward in turf engineering,” Fields said. “This campaign ensures that every coach, every player and every community understands what’s possible when you combine the playability of grass with the durability, reliability and recyclability of advanced turf.”
