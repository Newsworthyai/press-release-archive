# Steve Sickel Appointed CEO of the IHG Owners Association

The IHG Owners Association, which represents the interests of IHG Hotels & Resorts franchisees around the world, announced today that Steve Sickel has been appointed Chief Executive Officer and will serve in the role beginning November 24.

 As CEO, Sickel will remain steadfast in upholding the Association’s mission to strengthen the returns on members’ investments in IHG hotels and will lead the Association’s advice and counsel to IHG. He succeeds John Muehlbauer, who informed the Association earlier this year of his decision to retire at the end of 2025 following a distinguished 30-year career in hospitality and travel, including the last five years as CEO of the Association. Among his many achievements, Muehlbauer drove tens of millions in value to owners worldwide, including last year’s loyalty and IHG Ignite fee reductions. He will remain with the Association through year-end to ensure a smooth leadership transition.

 The Association launched a CEO search committee comprised of owner volunteers and partnered with Bristol Associates, a leading hospitality talent placement firm. Following a comprehensive process, the committee selected Sickel, an experienced executive with a proven track record of growth, innovation and leadership in multi-function and multi-brand global organizations in the hospitality and travel sectors.

 Sickel is fluent in the hospitality sector from his 13 years with IHG, during which he held various senior roles, culminating in the role of Global Head of Revenue Delivery, where he led the strategy and execution across IHG’s key commercial drivers such as IHG One Rewards, Distribution Marketing, Digital Marketing, Pricing and Revenue Management and the System Fund—experience that has prepared him well for his new position at the Association. In addition to IHG, Sickel served as CEO of RoomKey, an online travel distribution company formed as a joint venture among the world’s largest hospitality companies, where he designed strategies to lower the cost of hotel third-party distribution. Most recently, Sickel served as Partner & Chief Marketing Officer at The Mallet Group, a global loyalty marketing consultancy with a focus on the travel sector. Recognized by HSMAI as one of the “Top 25 Extraordinary Minds in Hospitality”, Sickel has an impressive background and pedigree to propel the Association forward.

 “I am so excited to step into this role and to have the opportunity to lead the Association and represent members worldwide,” says Sickel. “John has set a strong foundation of value creation and advocacy, and I look forward to building on that momentum. My focus will be on strengthening relationships with IHG hotel owners, IHG leadership and key industry constituents; developing and advocating for win-win solutions that improve the long-term value for our members; and harnessing our collective voice to drive meaningful impact with IHG and the hospitality industry.”

 Mark Zipperer, 2025 Chair of the Association’s Global Board of Directors, comments, “Steve’s deep knowledge of IHG, combined with his broad industry expertise and reputation as a collaborative problem-solver, make him the ideal choice for this role. We are excited to welcome him into the Association at such an important time for our industry.”

 The Association extends its gratitude to Muehlbauer for his leadership and dedication and congratulates him on his upcoming retirement.
