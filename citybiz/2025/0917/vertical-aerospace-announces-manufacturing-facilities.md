# Vertical Aerospace Announces Manufacturing Facilities

Vertical Aerospace [NYSE: EVTL], a global aerospace and technology company that is pioneering electric aviation, will host its Capital Markets Day today in New York City, beginning at 2:00 p.m. ET.

 The event will provide key updates on the Company’s Flightpath 2030 business strategy, certification and manufacturing progress, and financial outlook. A live webcast for the event is available here.

 Initial Production Facilities Secured

 Vertical will announce its first manufacturing sites to support certification and early production:

 * Aircraft assembly at expanded Cotswold Airport site – New facility adjacent to existing Flight Test Centre will have capacity to produce 25+ VX4 aircraft annually and brings Vertical’s total footprint at Cotswold Airport to ~100,000 sq ft.
* Battery production at expanded Avonmouth site – Adjacent to Vertical’s existing Energy Centre, this new 30,000 sq ft battery facility will triple capacity for battery production. This facility will provide production capacity into 2030 and brings Vertical’s total Energy Centre footprint to ~45,000 sq ft.

 Locating both facilities alongside existing operations reduces integration risk, drives efficiency, and enables a seamless ramp from prototype through certification and initial production aircraft. Vertical continues to progress site selection for its full-rate production and battery facilities, with locations in the UK and beyond under consideration and a final decision expected in 2026, ready to meet Vertical’s subsequent manufacturing ramp up.

 Efficient and Cost-Effective Certification Path

 Vertical will reaffirm its plan to certify the all-electric VX4 by 2028, requiring $700 million in funding to reach this milestone.

 Due to its focused OEM business model, low operating costs relative to the industry, efficient manufacturing plans and greater clarity of supplier costs, the Company is able to project requirements to reach certification by 2028. The approach of the UK Civil Aviation Authority (UK CAA) and European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), who are collaborating on eVTOL certification safety standards, front-loads the certification process and minimizes late-stage surprises or delays, providing greater confidence to Vertical’s plans and timelines.

 Updated Financial Outlook

 Vertical will provide revised targets for 2030 and beyond, reflecting momentum over the past year, integration of the hybrid-electric business plan, and increased certainty around supplier and manufacturing plans:

* Deliveries: at least 175 aircraft delivered cumulatively by 2030, versus prior guidance of at least 150.
* Manufacturing: over 225-unit per annum manufacturing run-rate (Q4-2030), versus prior guidance of over 200-unit per annum run-rate (Q4-2030), with plans to scale to target annual aircraft deliveries of 900 in 2035, versus prior guidance of 700 aircraft deliveries in the medium-term.
* Batteries: ~45,000 battery units delivered in 2035.
* Margins: Consolidated gross margin of 20% in 2030, rising to ~40% by 2035.
* Cash Flow: over $100 million positive operating cash flow in 2030, versus prior guidance of breakeven.

 ‘Transition’ flight on track for year end

 Vertical is on track to complete transition testing – the final stage of its piloted flight programme – by the end of 2025 and announced it will begin hybrid-electric flight testing in 2026.

 Transition will demonstrate the VX4’s ability to shift seamlessly between vertical lift (“helicopter mode”) and wingborne flight (“airplane mode”). This 20-second piloted manoeuvre is the defining capability of tiltrotor eVTOLs, enabling operations from rooftops, vertiports and heliports. Completion will mark a major technical unlock, a key de-risking milestone on the path to certification and revenue generation.

 Stuart Simpson, CEO of Vertical Aerospace, said: “Since launching Flightpath 2030, we’ve moved from ambition to execution. Piloted flight tests, the hybrid-electric programme, secured facilities, and greater cost visibility have meaningfully de-risked our plan and strengthened our financial outlook. With the final technical proof point – transition flight – anticipated by year-end, we now have a clear, efficient path to certification and commercialization at scale, positioning Vertical to lead the next era of electric flight.”
