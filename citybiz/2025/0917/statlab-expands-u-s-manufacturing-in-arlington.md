# StatLab Expands U.S. Manufacturing in Arlington

StatLab Medical Products, a leading global developer and manufacturer of pathology supplies and equipment, today announced the global launch of the PiSmart S1 single-hopper slide printer, expanding its existing PiSmart labeling and tracking solutions of both slide and cassette printers.

 Designed for unmatched speed, flexibility, and reliability, the PiSmart S1 features a completely redesigned, intuitive touch-screen interface for easier operation, along with hardware enhancements that ensure consistent performance. Its compact footprint supports on-demand printing, adapting seamlessly to diverse lab workflows while improving barcode readability and specimen tracking accuracy.

 Every PiSmart printer is backed by the PiSmart Promise: four years of service included with the use of StatLab validated slides. This integrated approach—pairing printers with precision-manufactured, validated KT® Premium Slides—creates a complete solution built for accuracy and reliability.

The launch coincides with major progress at StatLab’s Arlington, Texas manufacturing site, where U.S.-based slide production of KT slides is on track to begin before the end of 2025. As part of a strategic in-region, for-region manufacturing model, the facility will strengthen domestic slide supply of best-in-class adhesion slides for American labs, complementing StatLab’s existing cassette and container production in Arlington and expanding availability of essentials across the pathology workflow.

 “We’re excited to deliver more than just an expanded printer portfolio with this launch—we’re offering a complete solution,” said Dae Hong, StatLab CEO. “With the new PiSmart S1 paired with StatLab validated slides, soon to be manufactured here in the U.S., labs gain peace of mind. We trust PiSmart products to perform day after day, which is why we confidently back the full solution with an included service program you won’t find elsewhere—so labs can stay focused on delivering the best patient care possible.”

 The PiSmart S1 is available for order today through StatLab and authorized partners. For more information, visit StatLab.com/PiSmart.
