# Q&amp;A with Sonnet Hui, VP + Managing Director of the PMA Los Angeles Office: Building Lasting Change Through Behavioral Health Projects

As seen in the Los Angeles Business Journal LA 500, Sonnet Hui is the vice president and managing director of Project Management Advisors Inc., a downtown-based real estate consultant firm, in which Hui spearheads business strategy, operations and market growth for the firm. Her portfolio spans high-profile developments across residential, entertainment, health care, education and commercial sectors.

 Previously, Hui held the role of vice president of design and construction at NBCUniversal, where she oversaw major design, construction and capital planning initiatives for NBCUniversal and DreamWorks’ West Coast studio operations. Hui is a board of trustee member of Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science, and she is a strong advocate for addressing Los Angeles’ housing crisis.”

 Rising housing costs, addiction issues and an acute shortage of behavioral health resources have created a homelessness crisis across the United States, and Los Angeles is one of many cities looking for ways to solve this complex and divisive issue. We talked with Sonnet Hui, Vice President and Managing Director of the PMA Los Angeles office about her work on behavioral health projects such as Los Angeles’ Weingart Towers–currently California’s largest permanent supportive housing development–and how strategic project management, trauma informed design and cross-sector collaboration can create new solutions and reshape what’s possible for communities in need.

 Homelessness and behavioral health challenges have become more visible in cities around the United States. What are you seeing as the root of the problem?

 Across the country, we’re seeing rising housing costs, untreated mental illness, addiction issues, and a serious lack of resources aimed at solving these problems. As a result, too many people are forced into tents, encampments, or hospital emergency rooms because there simply aren’t enough behavioral health programs or supportive housing options available.

 The costs are staggering. For example, a chronically unhoused individual can generate hospital bills exceeding $40,000 annually—and in extreme cases, over $100,000—compared to around $18,000 for someone with stable housing. Supportive housing not only restores dignity, it also dramatically reduces emergency room visits, hospital stays, and overall healthcare costs.

 How can permanent supportive housing change those outcomes?

 Permanent supportive housing is one of the most effective tools we have to break the cycle of chronic homelessness. It provides stable, long-term housing paired with wraparound behavioral health services—an evidence-based approach that’s been shown to reduce Medicaid costs by up to 43% in some states. But the benefits go far beyond cost savings.

 These facilities offer more than shelter, they create a foundation for recovery, independence, and long-term stability. Residents gain access to mental health care, addiction treatment, job training, and community support in an environment designed to promote healing and dignity. Over time, we see dramatic reductions in emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and interactions with law enforcement.

 The challenge is speed and execution. Once financing is secured, these projects must navigate a maze of regulatory requirements, funding conditions, and construction constraints. That’s where disciplined project management becomes essential. It’s the difference between a well-intentioned plan and a fully realized space that restores lives. With the right leadership, we can accelerate delivery, align stakeholders, and ensure that every square foot is built with purpose.

 Tell me more about that. Can you explain why project management is so important for behavioral health and supportive housing developments?

 These projects are uniquely complex. They often rely on a mix of city, state, federal, and philanthropic funding—each with its own compliance requirements, timelines, and priorities. One funding source might conflict with another, and policies can shift midstream. Navigating these layers requires what professionals call “deconflicting”: ensuring that one set of requirements doesn’t derail another.

 Add to that the pressure of overlapping timelines, evolving regulations, and a capital stack that can include tax credits, grants, and private equity, and it’s clear there are countless moving parts between concept and completion. Disciplined project management is what holds it all together. When done right, it accelerates progress by aligning stakeholders, anticipating regulatory shifts, and sequencing critical tasks to avoid costly delays.

 The Weingart Towers project in Los Angeles is often highlighted as a model. What made that project successful?

 Weingart Towers is the largest permanent supportive housing development in California, with nearly 400 units and robust on-site behavioral health services. Its success came down to disciplined coordination and relentless attention to detail. From day one, our project management team partnered closely with the owner/operator, developer, architect, and the City of Los Angeles to align more than a dozen funding sources and navigate overlapping compliance frameworks.

 We mapped stakeholders and financing early, which helped minimize surprises and kept every partner focused on the same mission. We also sequenced work packages with precision to meet stringent ADA requirements—where even a fraction of an inch on a sink height could trigger costly reworks and delays. It’s a testament to what’s possible when technical rigor meets shared purpose.

 Aside from the logistics, how does design factor into these kinds of projects?

 Design plays a critical role—especially when trauma-informed principles are thoughtfully integrated. We prioritized natural light, calming color palettes, wood textures, and open layouts to help residents regulate circadian rhythms, reduce anxiety, and feel safe. We intentionally avoided hidden or enclosed spaces in common areas, which can trigger trauma responses, and instead created environments that feel open, welcoming, and predictable.

 Features like aromatherapy, nature-inspired materials, and wellness amenities—gardens, fitness rooms, quiet zones—support both mental and physical health. Every design decision was rooted in healing, dignity, and stability, while also accommodating the intensive medical and social services provided on-site. It’s about creating a space where recovery feels possible and people can truly begin to rebuild.

 Building in Skid Row must have presented additional challenges. How did you address those challenges when they came up?

 Building in Skid Row required a different kind of awareness—one rooted in empathy, adaptability, and deep respect for the community. The population here has experienced profound trauma, and that shaped how we approached everything from site logistics to daily communication. We encountered behaviors that reflected survival instincts—hypervigilance, distrust, and at times, unpredictable responses to noise, movement, or perceived disruption.

 To meet those realities, we adjusted construction schedules to minimize triggering activities, trained crews in trauma-informed engagement, and maintained a consistent presence to build trust. We also worked closely with local service providers to ensure our efforts aligned with ongoing outreach and care. The scrutiny was intense, and the coordination was nonstop—but the result was a facility that integrates healthcare, case management, job training, and wellness services in a way that truly meets people where they are.

 Every challenge reminded us why the work matters. When you build in Skid Row, you’re not just constructing a building, you’re helping to rebuild lives.

 What lessons did you gain from the Weingart Towers project that can be applied to future projects?

 The biggest lesson? Success starts with early and unwavering alignment among public agencies, private developers, and service providers all working in lockstep from day one. That kind of coordination doesn’t happen by accident. It takes disciplined project management to turn well-meaning plans into real spaces that don’t just house people but heal them.

 When leadership is strong and the mission is clear, you create more than buildings. You create stability, dignity, and the possibility of a new beginning. One project at a time, we’re proving what’s possible when purpose meets precision.
