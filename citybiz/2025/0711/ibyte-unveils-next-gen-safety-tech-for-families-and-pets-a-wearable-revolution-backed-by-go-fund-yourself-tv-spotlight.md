# iBYTE Unveils Next-Gen Safety Tech for Families and Pets: A Wearable Revolution Backed by Go Fund Yourself TV Spotlight

iBYTE, an emerging innovator in wearable safety technology, is making waves with the official debut of its self-charging, real-time tracking device designed to discreetly protect children, pets, and vulnerable individuals. The company’s mission-driven approach to tackling human trafficking and family safety caught national attention after being featured on Season 2 of the hit entrepreneur reality show Go Fund Yourself on Cheddar TV.

 With its sleek, non-invasive design, iBYTE delivers more than just peace of mind—it offers a lifeline. Combining real-time GPS tracking with vital health monitoring capabilities, the device is ideal for families, schools, pet owners, and organizations dedicated to safeguarding loved ones. Unlike traditional solutions, iBYTE is semi-permanent and self-powered, making it both practical and unobtrusive for long-term use.

 “Too many families live in fear of the unknown—where their child is, whether their elderly parent is safe, or if their pet has wandered too far,” said Nicholas Fratantonio, Founder and CEO of iBYTE. “We created iBYTE to close that gap, to offer a solution that’s invisible yet powerful, and above all, proactive in protecting those we care about most.”

 

 On Go Fund Yourself, Fratantonio shared the deeply personal and global implications of iBYTE’s mission: addressing the urgent issue of abduction and trafficking with technology that empowers families and communities. The exposure not only validated the product’s urgency but sparked conversations with investors, parents, and policy advocates alike.

 The iBYTE device is currently available for pre-order, with initial applications geared toward child safety, pet tracking, and elder care. Future versions aim to expand into school partnerships, emergency response systems, and smart city integrations.
