# Lifelong Pet Lovers Debut New Pet Supplies Plus Location in Hamilton, NJ

Pet Supplies Plus is hosting a grand opening of a new location on May 31 through June 1 at 1005 White Horse Ave in Hamilton, NJ to offer pet parents a hassle-free shopping experience with a wide selection of pet products at the best price guaranteed. Known for its friendly staff and helpful customer service, Pet Supplies Plus helps local pet parents save money and celebrate the fun of pet ownership, offering a wide array of natural pet foods and products for cats, dogs, reptiles, birds, fish, and small animals. Stores also offer amenities such as a full-service grooming salon, self-serve pet wash stations, a knowledgeable pet care team, and carry-out service, where team members carry heavy items to neighbors’ cars. Whether shopping in-store or online, choosing local is easy at Pet Supplies Plus in Hamilton.

 Pet Supplies Plus focuses on providing a unique in-store experience for all of its new “neighbors” (the term Pet Supplies Plus uses for customer). The new store is owned by local entrepreneurs Amit and Neha Sharma. The Sharma’s, who immigrated to the United States in 2006, have been part of the Hamilton-area community since 2016. After pursuing several entrepreneurial ventures, they wanted to make a positive impact in their community. They decided to bring a new Pet Supplies Plus to the area because of the brand’s neighbor-focused mentality and their desire to positively affect local pets and their owners.

 As community partners, Sharma’s will work alongside local animal shelters, rescue organizations and non-profits to host year-round adoption events, fundraisers, and pet food and product drives.

 “We’re passionate about serving our community and wanted to create a welcoming place where pet owners can find everything they need,” said Amit. “Pet Supplies Plus stood out to us because of its focus on personalized service and community involvement. We’re excited to bring that experience to Hamilton.”

 To welcome the community to the new Pet Supplies Plus location, the Sharma’s will host a weekend-long grand opening event with 4x rewards points available on all purchases, special prize giveaways, huge discounts and more. The free Pet Supplies Plus Rewards program allows members to receive regular coupons on products they frequently purchase, monthly specials, members only sales and other personalized offers.

 Beginning on Saturday, May 31 and continuing through Sunday, June 1, grand opening festivities at the new Pet Supplies Plus will include:

 · Saturday, May 31 – Sunday, June 1 – Pet Supplies Plus will provide complimentary free pet washes as well as a dog splash pad and local dogs that will be up for adoption.
