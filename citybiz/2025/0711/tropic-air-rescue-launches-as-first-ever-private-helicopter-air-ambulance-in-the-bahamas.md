# Tropic Air Rescue Launches as First-Ever Private Helicopter Air Ambulance in the Bahamas

Membership-based service offers travelers, boaters and residents lifesaving speed and peace of mind

 Tropic Air Rescue, founded by aviation expert and veteran first responder Anthony Marinello, has officially launched the first private helicopter air ambulance service in the Bahamas and Florida. Operating via a subscription membership model, Tropic Air Rescue offers fast, lifesaving transport to and between islands—an operational milestone unmatched in the region.

 Unlike traditional fixed-wing air ambulances, which can take between eight to 36 hours to reach a patient, Tropic Air Rescue deploys immediately via twin-engine Sikorsky S-76B helicopters, staffed by certified trauma paramedics, nurses and critical care physicians. Members benefit from around-the-clock emergency coverage, with no out-of-pocket costs at the time of rescue.

 In addition to individual and family plans, the service has been widely embraced by boaters, yacht owners and second-home residents seeking reliable access to emergency care. With tourism, weather events and high-net-worth travel all placing increased demand on regional healthcare, Tropic Air Rescue is emerging as a vital resource for both individuals and the broader economy of the islands.

 Plans include:

 * Individual coverage: From $1,000/year or $25/day
* Family coverage: Up to five members at $750/month or $3,650/year
* Marine Vessel coverage: $120/foot, covering everyone aboard with a minimum three-month term

 With more than 35 successful rescues completed in its first year of operations, including nighttime trauma lifts from private islands, yachts and cruise ships, Tropic Air Rescue is already reshaping what emergency response looks like for remote destinations.

 The company is also the first-ever FAA-certified helicopter air ambulance dedicated to the Bahamas and uniquely holds cabotage clearance allowing it to legally transport Bahamian citizens between islands for emergency medical care – something no other air rescue company has achieved.

 “Before we launched, many patients had to wait more than a full day for help to arrive,” said Marinello. “We’re changing that. Our mission is to make lifesaving care accessible within the golden hour, no matter how remote the location.”

 The company is led by a distinguished team that includes Marinello, a 28-year veteran of the New Jersey State Police and 21-years as a helicopter pilot with 40 years in the industry; alongside Medical Director Dr. Mauricio Lynn, a renowned trauma surgeon affiliated with Jackson Health and UHealth; and COO Robbie J. Meek, a critical care aviation expert with over two decades of emergency management experience.

 Memberships activate within 48 hours of enrollment and are available online at www.tropicairrescue.com. Dispatch coverage includes all over 700 Bahamian islands and coastal Florida communities, with services available 24/7.
