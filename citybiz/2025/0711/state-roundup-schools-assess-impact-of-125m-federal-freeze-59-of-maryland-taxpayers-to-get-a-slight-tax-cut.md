# State Roundup: Schools Assess Impact Of $125M Federal Freeze; 59% Of Maryland Taxpayers To Get A Slight Tax Cut

PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO FEEL THE PAIN OF $125 MILLION FEDERAL FREEZE: Dozens of advocates gathered in a webinar Wednesday to try to determine the impact of the possible loss of $125 million in federal aid to Maryland schools this year, part of $6.8 billion in education funding frozen just last week by the Trump administration. They know this much: The news is not good. William Ford/Maryland Matters.

 59% OF STATE TAXPAYERS TO SEE SLIGHT INCOME TAX CUT: About 59% of Maryland taxpayers will see a slight reduction in their state income taxes. To tout tax cuts for Marylanders, Gov. Wes Moore has focused on a limited slice of the budget with his income tax claim. Although some people will see a tax cut, the budget package raises $1.6 billion in new and additional taxes and fees to help close a multibillion-dollar deficit. How all those pieces fit together to affect Maryland households’ finances is more complicated. Pamela Wood/The Baltimore Banner.

 MARYLAND’s GREEN ENERGY PUSH IN LIMBO EVEN WITH MOORE’s BACKING: Years after the announcement of a Maryland wind energy initiative, the project’s industrial site in Baltimore remains mostly inactive, spurring questions about the governor’s pledge to make the state a national leader in offshore wind energy. Rep. Andy Harris said that he is alarmed by what he described as costly delays in offshore wind generation for the state. Gary Collins/The Baltimore Sun.

 B’MORE JOINS 33 JURISDICTIONS SUING TRUMP OVER TARGETED FUNDING CUTS: Thirty-four cities and counties, including Baltimore, Chicago and Los Angeles, have asked to join a California lawsuit seeking to stop the Trump administration from cutting federal funding based on sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with the administration’s mass deportation agenda. Tim Henderson/Maryland Matters.

 STATE TRANSPORTATION SECTY WIEDEFELD TO LEAVE POST: Paul Wiedefeld, whom Gov. Wes Moore (D) once dubbed “the transportation leader we need at this moment,” will leave the job he has held since 2023 and trigger a search for a new state transportation secretary. Wiedefeld, who turns 70 next month, is expected to leave the position Aug 1. He will be replaced — at least temporarily — by Deputy Secretary Samantha Biddle. Bryan Sears/Maryland Matters.

 * Wiedefeld brought extensive experience to the role, with a four-decade career in transportation and transit, including previous tenures leading the D.C. Metro system, Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport and the Maryland Transit Administration. Pamela Wood/The Baltimore Banner.
* Wiedefeld also guided the Purple Line light rail transit project and oversaw the state’s transportation-related response to the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. Marcus Dieterle/Baltimore Fishbowl.

 MOORE HEADS TO ‘BILLIONAIRE SUMMER CAMP’ IN IDAHO: Gov. Wes Moore is heading back to “billionaire summer camp” this week, a trip to Idaho that involves both personal and political travel. Officially known as the Sun Valley Conference and hosted at a mountain resort by the investment firm Allen & Company, the cloistered multi-day event attracts tech and media CEOs, investors and politicians. “The governor’s lodging and travel expenses will not be covered by the state,” a spokesman said. Pamela Wood/The Baltimore Banner.

 MO CO BILL WOULD REQUIRE UNION ‘PEACE PACTS’ FOR COUNTY FUNDED HOTELS: Community members, labor advocates and hospitality professionals weighed in before the Montgomery County Council on Tuesday on legislation that would require any hotel or conference center supported by county funding to enter into labor peace agreements with employee unions and other labor organizations in order to receive the county’s financial backing. Ginny Bixby/Bethesday Today.

 MAYOR SCOTT OUTLINES OVERDOSE PREVENTION PLAN FOR BALTIMORE: Baltimore’s City Council finally had a chance to directly hear from Mayor Brandon Scott’s Office directly about his plan to use hundreds of millions of dollars in drug manufacturer settlement money to address the city’s opioid overdose issue Wednesday. The city has not been able to fully divulge its full vision for the more than $400 million, and possibly more, it won from companies like CVS and Cardinal Health, because it’s been tied up in litigation and did not want to jeopardize the case. Scott Maucione/WYPR-FM.

 CONTRACTOR VIOLATED STATE REGS IN CITY DOCK SPILL, REPORT FINDS: Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. was found to have violated several environmental regulations in an inspection by the Maryland Department of the Environment at the City Dock project in Annapolis. MDE inspected the site on June 28, after sediment-laden water spilled into the street from the construction site. The inspection report was completed July 1, and the matter remains under investigation. Tori Newby/The Baltimore Sun.
