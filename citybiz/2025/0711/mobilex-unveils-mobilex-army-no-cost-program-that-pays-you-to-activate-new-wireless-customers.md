# MobileX Unveils MobileX Army: No-Cost Program That Pays You to Activate New Wireless Customers

MobileX, the most customizable wireless service designed to save consumers money, today announced the launch of the MobileX Army — a new program that empowers anyone to earn money by activating service for new MobileX customers and helping expand affordable wireless service.

 With no upfront cost to join, the MobileX Army rewards include commissions for the life of the recruit for helping grow the MobileX movement. MobileX ambassadors earn 10%* on each recruit’s monthly spend. Plus, they’ll receive a $5 bonus for each new customer that ports their phone number over from another carrier and signs up for an Unlimited plan, or a Build Your Own plan with a minimum of 3GB of data and unlimited talk/text. Whether an influencer, content creator or an everyday user, ambassadors are now part of a grassroots mission to deliver affordable wireless service to the masses.

 “We have created the opportunity for individuals and businesses to activate MobileX customers simply and fast, right on the app,” said Peter Adderton, founder and CEO of MobileX. “There is no more powerful marketing channel than word of mouth referrals. If you’re already telling your friends and family about MobileX, why not get paid for it? We’ve made it simple to turn your network into a revenue stream, all while helping others escape overpriced, outdated wireless plans.”

 How It Works:

 1. Enlist. Signing up is quick and free at MobileXArmy.com or within the MobileX iOS/Android apps. Ambassadors receive a unique QR code and welcome email with everything they need to start recruiting.
2. Promote. Ambassadors can invite anyone including friends, family and followers to explore MobileX by sharing their personal QR code. New customers scan the code, download the MobileX app, sign up and activate service.
3. Earn. Once the customer activates and pays for the service, ambassadors begin earning a 10% commission as long as the recruit remains a MobileX customer, plus a $5 bonus if the customer ports in their number from another carrier and signs up for an Unlimited plan, or a Build Your Own plan with a minimum of 3GB of data and unlimited talk/text.

 Payouts are automated and processed monthly, with funds delivered promptly via direct deposit or PayPal within 30 days of the previous billing cycle. The program runs on secure, transparent infrastructure powered by Impact. To support ambassadors at every step, MobileX provides dedicated XpertCare assistance and a live dashboard where participants can track sign-ups, activations and earnings in real time.

 MobileX continues to challenge the legacy wireless model by offering a smarter, more personalized experience. The service uses AI to analyze customer behavior and forecast usage, recommending plans based on actual need. Customers can choose between fully customized or unlimited plans, all delivered over one of the fastest 5G networks in America.

 With rewards like these, why wouldn’t you answer the call? To learn more or to enlist in the MobileX Army, visit MobileXArmy.com.

 *The 10% commission applies solely to the customer’s monthly plan cost, excluding taxes, fees, or other non-plan charges.
