# Forbes Names Kennedy Krieger One of Maryland’s Best Employers

Kennedy Krieger Ranks No. 39 on the List of the State’s Best Employers and No. 19 of Maryland Employers with Headquarters in the State

 Kennedy Krieger Institute, a globally recognized organization dedicated to improving the lives of patients with, or at risk for, disorders and injuries of the nervous system, has been named to the Forbes list of Best Employers in Maryland for 2025. This is the second year in a row that the Institute has received this honor, which is awarded to companies with more than 500 employees and is based on survey results.

 Kennedy Krieger is ranked as the 39th best employer in Maryland on Forbes’ list, and 19th among Maryland employers with headquarters in the state. The Institute employs more than 3,100 employees who deliver medical, therapeutic, educational, research, and community services to nearly 30,000 unique patients and students each year.

 “It’s an honor to be recognized as one of the state’s best employers for two years in a row. We have worked hard to create a welcoming workplace where our team feels seen and is able to make meaningful impacts on the lives of our patients, students, and families” said Dr. Brad Schlaggar, MD, PhD, President and CEO of Kennedy Krieger Institute. “This award is a credit to our mission-driven faculty and staff, and the work they put in each and every day.”

 The Forbes ranking, America’s Best Employers by State, is based on a survey of over 160,000 employees from organizations across the country. Participants rated their employers on a scale of zero to 10 and were asked whether they would recommend their workplace to others. The surveyors also considered public evaluations from friends and family members of employees as well as members of the public who work in the same industry.

 “We know there is something special about working at Kennedy Krieger. We feel it every day,” said Raymond Short, Senior Vice President of Human Resources at Kennedy Krieger. “It’s great to know that others outside our organization see this as well.”

 Companies do not pay a fee to participate or be selected in any of Forbes’ rankings.
