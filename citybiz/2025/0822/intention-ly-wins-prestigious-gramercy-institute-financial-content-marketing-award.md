# Intention.ly Wins Prestigious Gramercy Institute Financial Content Marketing Award

Intention.ly, the go-to growth engine for financial services firms, has been honored with the 2025 Gramercy Institute Financial Content Marketing Award in the Wealth Management Business-to-Intermediary category for their work with Integrated Partners on “The Organic Growth Toolkit.”

 The award recognizes excellence and achievement in financial content marketing, with judging carried out by a panel of financial services marketing leaders from the world’s top financial, media and marketing brands. This year’s awards drew a highly competitive field of entries from financial firms and agencies globally.

 “The Organic Growth Toolkit” was developed as a comprehensive downloadable guide designed to help financial advisors accelerate business growth through four distinct strategies: moving upmarket to serve higher-net-worth clients, niching down to scale expertise, leveraging foundational marketing tactics, and investing in education and professional development.

 The campaign delivered exceptional results, capturing 168 qualified leads at a highly efficient $142.70 cost-per-lead. The toolkit’s success prompted Integrated Partners to repurpose the content for one-on-one sales outreach in their advisor recruitment efforts.

 “Our content philosophy has always been to lead with genuine value rather than a sales pitch,” said Kelly Waltrich, CEO and Co-Founder of Intention.ly. “We’re thrilled the Gramercy Institute resonated with our approach, and we’re lucky to work with firms like Integrated Partners, who recognize the power of educational, actionable resources to build real connections with prospects. Time after time, those are the campaigns we see driving significant results.”

 The winning entry reimagined traditional sales collateral as a strategic resource backed with proprietary data, including statistics showing that Integrated Partners’ top 40 advisors achieved 17% average year-over-year growth since 2020.

 Gramercy’s Financial Content Marketing Awards honor excellence in content marketing within the financial services industry. Winners were selected based on strategy, execution, innovation, metrics, and results.

 The Intention.ly team behind the winning entry included Jess Flynn (VP, Client Account Strategy), Kristin Fink (VP, Client Account Strategy), Evan Hornberger (Creative Director), Dan Natale (Head of Demand Generation), and Lauren Sanders (Head of Content).
