# Capriotti’s Sandwich Shop Opens in Marlton on August 26th

Capriotti’s Sandwich Shop (Capriotti’s), known for its award-winning, hand-crafted cheesesteaks, turkey subs and more, is set to celebrate the grand opening of its newest location in Marlton on Tuesday, August 26. Situated at 1041 NJ-73, Unit H1, this new store marks the second Capriotti’s venture for local entrepreneurs and husband-and-wife duo Jimit Dharia and Urvi Jatania, who also successfully operate the Princeton, New Jersey location.

 Meet the Local Franchise Owners:

 Originally from India, Jimit and Urvi bring a strong entrepreneurial background to the Capriotti’s system. With years of experience running restaurants and a construction business, the couple had been actively searching for the right quick service restaurant (QSR) concept to invest in when they discovered Capriotti’s. After visiting a location in Pennsylvania and experiencing the quality firsthand, they knew they’d found the perfect fit. Now longtime Central Jersey residents, Jimit and Urvi plan to open eight additional Capriotti’s locations across the state.

 “We are thrilled to continue growing Capriotti’s in New Jersey and bring our passion for premium, handcrafted sandwiches to the Marlton community,” said Jimit. “As someone who truly values high-quality food, I’m excited to introduce Capriotti’s bold flavors and exceptional service to even more guests in South Jersey.”

 Capriotti’s is known for its wide array of sandwiches including:

 * The Bobbie: Known as the Greatest Sandwich in America, this iconic Capriotti’s sub is created with slow-roasted, hand-pulled turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing and mayo.
* Capastrami: A bold flavor bomb that means business – this fan favorite is stacked with piping-hot pastrami, melted Swiss, zesty Russian dressing, and a crunchy layer of house-made coleslaw. It’s craveable and unapologetically delicious.
* Cheesesteaks: Loaded with a choice of juicy premium steak, prime-grade American Wagyu from Snake River Farms (R), savory chicken, or Impossible plant-based meat smothered in gooey melted cheese, mushrooms, grilled onions and your pick of grilled hot or sweet peppers. It’s comfort food with an edge.

 Capriotti’s in Marlton makes it easy for guests to enjoy their favorites with convenient order-ahead, online ordering, and third-party delivery options. The shop also offers catering for events of all sizes – from corporate meetings to birthday parties – with selections like cold sub trays, box lunches, and a hot homemade meatball bar.
