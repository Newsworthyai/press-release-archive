# Another Economic Opportunity Missed By Maryland And The Moore Administration

The AP headline reads: “US seeks shipbuilding expertise from South Korea and Japan to counter China.” Sens. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., and Andy Kim, D-N.J., traveled to Seoul to meet top shipbuilders in hopes of “forming joint ventures to construct and repair noncombatant vessels for the U.S. Navy in the Indo-Pacific and bring investments to American shipyards.”

 So while Duckworth and Kim are traveling to South Korea and Japan to bring shipbuilding and all of the economic development that it implies, the senior Senator from Maryland travels to El Salvador to meet with a deported alleged wife beater and MS13 gang member. And if I am not mistaken, our presidential aspirant (despite all denials) Wes Moore visited the very same countries earlier this summer and came back with zilch!

 Why would the Trump Administration’s plan to expand the country’s shipbuilding capacity be of interest to the states’ federal legislatures as well as the states’ governors? Because Maryland has a history of being a shipbuilding mecca. Let’s take a look at some history.

 Shipbuilding was a significant activity in Maryland during World War II, with several shipyards playing critical roles in the war effort, particularly in Baltimore. Maryland’s shipyards were heavily involved in constructing and repairing vessels as part of the U.S. Maritime Commission’s Emergency Shipbuilding Program. Below are key details about shipbuilding in Maryland during this period:

 Bethlehem Fairfield Shipyard (Baltimore, MD): Situated on the south shore of the Middle Branch of the Patapsco River in the Fairfield section of Baltimore. The yard built 384 Liberty ships, which were standardized cargo vessels designed for quick and cost-effective construction to transport goods and troops. The first Liberty ship, SS Patrick Henry, was launched on September 27, 1941. An additional 94 Victory ships, as well as 45 Landing Ship Tanks (LSTs), were used for amphibious warfare to transport tanks, vehicles, and troops.

 Sparrows Point Shipyard (Baltimore County, MD): Located on 200 acres along the Patapsco River near the Chesapeake Bay. This yard was a major player in shipbuilding during World War II.

 Key Highway Yards (Baltimore, MD): Located along the southern side of Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, near Federal Hill and operated by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, these yards were part of the “upper yard” (distinguished from the “lower yard” near Fort McHenry).

 Maryland Shipbuilding and Drydock Company (Baltimore, MD): Located along the Patapsco River, across from Fort McHenry. Originally founded as Globe Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in 1920, it became Maryland Drydock in 1922 and later Maryland Shipbuilding and Drydock Company by the 1950s.

 The shipyards employed thousands, including women (“Rosie the Riveter” and “Wendy the Welder”) and African Americans, who were integrated into higher-paying industrial roles due to labor shortages.

 Baltimore’s shipbuilding industry transformed the city into a major industrial hub, with nearly a million residents by the end of the war. The influx of workers and economic activity spurred growth, though postwar economic shifts later led to downsizing and closures. If it was there once before, it can be there again because one thing is for sure. The Trump Administration is serious about shipbuilding in America and countering the Chinese in this effort.

 Maryland’s history shows that shipbuilding can once again be a major player in the business of national defense, and more importantly, it can bring a true economic boom to both the state and the area surrounding the City of Baltimore. So instead of chasing individuals who are living in the country illegally and who are being deported or trying to stop law enforcement in the District of Columbia, the senior Senator from Maryland should be on that plane to Asia along with an economic team provided by the Governor. It could be the start of plugging that $3 billion hole in the budget and helping to Make Maryland Great Again!
