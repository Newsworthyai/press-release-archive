# FreedomCar Launches “FreedomCar-CONNECT” — A Concierge Service For Aging Gracefully

FreedomCar, Baltimore’s trusted car service for over 30 years, is expanding beyond transportation with the launch of FreedomCar-CONNECT — a personal concierge service designed to help older adults and their families reclaim their most valuable resource: quality time together.

 FreedomCar-CONNECT pairs each household with a dedicated Client Advocate — a trusted, long-term point of contact who handles the day-to-day administrative and logistical tasks that can become overwhelming as we age. From scheduling medical appointments and coordinating home repairs to organizing paperwork, arranging wellness services, or even setting up technology, FreedomCar-CONNECT takes care of the “to-do” list so families can focus on meaningful moments together.

 “Too often, adult children find their visits with aging parents consumed by errands, paperwork, and problem-solving,” said FreedomCar Founder Mark Thistel. “We wanted to create a service that gives families back that time, and ensures older adults feel supported, independent, and connected.”

 The service launches with Debbie Kennison as its inaugural Client Advocate in the Baltimore metropolitan area. Debbie’s role begins with a two-hour in-home assessment to understand needs, goals, and priorities. She then visits weekly to provide ongoing coordination, updates, and a personal touch that makes the service feel less like a transaction and more like family.

 “My best day is when I feel like I’ve made someone else’s day a little bit brighter,” said Kennison. “This is about listening to people’s stories, finding creative solutions, and making life run more smoothly.”

 The philosophy behind FreedomCar-CONNECT echoes a growing national conversation about “joyspan” — the idea that the real measure of aging well isn’t just how long we live, but how much we enjoy our lives along the way. By removing daily stressors and promoting connection, FreedomCar-CONNECT helps clients focus on the experiences, relationships, and activities that bring joy.
