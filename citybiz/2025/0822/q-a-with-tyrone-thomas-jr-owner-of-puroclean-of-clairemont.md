# Q&amp;A with Tyrone Thomas Jr., Owner of PuroClean of Clairemont

PuroClean is a leading property restoration franchise providing water damage remediation, fire and smoke damage restoration, mold remediation, and biohazard clean-up services to residential and commercial customers across the U.S. and Canada. Since its founding in 2001, the brand has grown to more than 500 independently owned locations, each committed to rapid response, expert training, and compassionate care.

 Tyrone Thomas joined the PuroClean network with two business partners, Marife Jarillo and Sean Thomas, and brought more than a decade of restoration experience, a passion for helping people, and a vision for building a business rooted in integrity and excellence. In just a few short years, that vision has grown into three thriving locations across Southern California—Clairemont, Bonita, and Del Cerro—and earned me recognition as a Brand Ambassador (Franchise Owners who share their time and insight to help prospective franchise owners learn about the PuroClean brand), a two-time President’s Circle honoree (top 10% of PuroClean Franchise Owners nationwide), and a member of the Network Leadership Council (a select group that collaborates with PuroClean leadership on growth and strategy efforts to uplift the brand).

 You joined the PuroClean network in 2021 and now own three locations across California. What inspired your transition into business ownership, and what has your entrepreneurial journey looked like so far?

 I’ve been in the restoration industry for 15 years, and before opening my own business, I spent nine years with a competitor. That experience gave me a strong foundation, but I knew I wanted the freedom to shape my own company culture—one built on integrity, excellence, and compassion. Joining PuroClean felt like the right step. Growing to three locations has been both challenging and incredibly rewarding, and every milestone reinforces my belief that with the right team, systems, and values, you can turn a vision into something truly impactful.

 You’ve been recognized as a Brand Ambassador and a two-time President’s Circle honoree. What drives your commitment to excellence within the PuroClean system?

 Excellence is more than a goal—it’s a responsibility. When property owners call, they’re often facing one of the hardest moments in their lives. We treat every customer like family, and that mindset drives everything we do. These recognitions aren’t just personal honors —they reflect my team’s dedication and hard work. Delivering exceptional service time and again strengthens both my business and the PuroClean brand.

 In 2024, you joined PuroClean’s Network Leadership Council (NLC). What motivated you to get involved, and how are you approaching your role?

 I believe in the power of collaboration and in helping shape the future of our network. As a business owner, I’ve experienced both the challenges and opportunities that come with growth, and I know how valuable it is to have a voice at the table. My role on the NLC is to represent my fellow Franchise Owners, share real-world insights, and help develop strategies that work in the field, not just on paper.

 How do peer leadership and franchisee-led initiatives like the NLC contribute to the strength of the brand?

 When franchise owners lead, it builds a sense of shared ownership. The NLC gives PuroClean Franchise Owners a platform to share ideas, solve problems together, and stay aligned on what’s best for our customers. That kind of collaboration not only strengthens our operations but also reinforces the trust and unity that make PuroClean such a strong brand.

 Southern California is known for unique restoration challenges. What issues do you see most often, and how do your teams address them?

 In our market, we face a mix of wildfire damage, smoke cleanup, flash flood damage, and water intrusion. Each of our locations is trained to handle these challenges, and we’ve built strong relationships with local emergency response teams. Speed, adaptability, and compassion are key—our crews respond quickly and guide customers through every step of the restoration process.

 Looking ahead, how do you hope to continue making a difference within PuroClean, and what advice would you give other franchise owners?

 My focus is on leading by example—continuing to innovate, staying connected with the community, and mentoring new PuroClean Franchise Owners. My advice? Stay engaged and never stop learning. Build a team culture where every member takes pride in their work. When we lift each other up in the PuroClean network, we all succeed, and the brand becomes even stronger.

 “At the end of the day, we’re not just restoring properties—we’re restoring peace of mind. That’s what drives me, my team, and my commitment to PuroClean every single day.”
