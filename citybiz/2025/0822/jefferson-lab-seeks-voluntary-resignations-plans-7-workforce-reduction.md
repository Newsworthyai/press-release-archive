# Jefferson Lab Seeks Voluntary Resignations, Plans 7% Workforce Reduction

The Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility is seeking to cut about 7% of its staff through voluntary resignations, according to a report from WHRO.

 The federal research center, which operates under contract with the Department of Energy, said the reduction amounts to roughly 65 positions. Employees who choose to leave will be eligible for severance payments of up to $50,000, with payouts determined by performance and tenure.

 Staff members have until Aug. 26 to apply, and each has an eight-day window to reconsider once opting in. The laboratory said it will weigh an employee’s skill set and the potential impact of their departure before approving any separation.

 If the lab doesn’t meet its reduction target, it plans to implement layoffs by January.

 Director Jens Dilling told WHRO the move was driven by the need to restructure rather than by federal budget cuts. “This will not be a threat to what we’re already doing, but will enhance our capabilities to do more,” he said.

 Jefferson Lab, based in Newport News, is one of the nation’s premier nuclear physics research centers and plays a key role in advancing particle accelerator technology.
