# Alper JCC Miami Welcomes 500+ Guests and Partners at Annual Discovery Day

Alper JCC Miami hosted its annual Discovery Day on Sunday, August 17, drawing more than 500 attendees for a day of family activities, community partnerships and membership opportunities.

 The campus-wide event showcased the J’s wide range of programs while strengthening ties with community partners. Families enjoyed interactive experiences with the Miami-Dade Sheriff’s Office, Miami-Dade Fire Department, PJ Library and Jewish Volunteer Services. A police helicopter flyover, sample fitness classes, pool and splash pad activities and live entertainment rounded out the day.

 Local businesses and organizations also played a key role, with food provided by Giardino Gourmet Salads, Sophia’s Burgers, V Gelato & Café and No Limits Coffee Shop, which is staffed by individuals with special needs.

 Membership was a central focus of the event. Guests took advantage of the J’s fall promotion offering no dues until October and explored updated programs in aquatics, fitness, cultural arts, and family services.
