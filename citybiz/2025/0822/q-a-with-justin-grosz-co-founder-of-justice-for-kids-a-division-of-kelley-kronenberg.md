# Q&amp;A with Justin Grosz, Co-Founder of Justice for Kids, a Division of Kelley Kronenberg

As co-founder of Justice for Kids®, a division of Kelley Kronenberg, Justin Grosz has dedicated his career to representing society’s most vulnerable children. With over 30 years of experience as a trial lawyer, Justin is a fierce advocate for his young clients, working tirelessly to secure justice and drive reforms that can safeguard thousands of children from harm.

 Along with his partners, Justin has built a unique law practice focused on fighting for children who have been harmed by the very systems designed to protect them. The practice, which is part of a national firm, focuses on a wide range of cases, from physical and sexual abuse in foster care to civil rights violations and catastrophic injuries.

 Justice for Kids® is a unique law practice. Can you introduce us to the practice and explain your focus?

 At Justice for Kids, we focus on helping children who have been hurt by the very systems designed to protect them, like child protection and disability services. We file personal injury damages lawsuits and handle cases involving physical and sexual abuse in foster care, negligence and oversight failures, child exploitation and trafficking, negligent care and supervision, civil rights violations, and adoption negligence.

 Our main goal is simple: to give these children a voice and the chance at the future they truly deserve.

 Why did you and your law partners create Justice for Kids?​

 I co-founded Justice for Kids alongside Howard Talenfeld and Stacie Schmerling, and we joined forces with Kelley Kronenberg. Together, we’ve built a team of some of the nation’s most experienced and dedicated children’s rights and personal injury attorneys to create a powerhouse practice narrowly focused on representing and protecting society’s most vulnerable children.

 Together, we’re better equipped to pursue justice, secure substantial awards for damages, and drive legislative and judicial change that can safeguard thousands of children from harm.

 At its core, Justice for Kids represents our deep commitment to providing comprehensive legal support to children who’ve suffered catastrophic harm and loss from abuse and neglect. We want to make sure they have the strongest possible advocates fighting for their rights and well-being.

 What types of clients do you serve?

 Typically, our clients are children who have been harmed in child welfare systems: foster homes, group homes, shelters, residential treatment facilities, schools, and day care centers. We are representing children who have been abused, abandoned, and neglected. We work tirelessly on their behalf, representing them through their guardians, next friends, court-appointed attorneys, guardians ad litem, adoptive parents, parents and grandparents. Our goal is always to provide them with the strongest possible legal voice and advocacy when they’ve been tragically harmed.

 As a children’s civil rights lawyer, what are some of the biggest issues you are seeing?

 One of the most common themes we see is systemic failure. When the very systems intended to protect children fail them – whether through bad actors, lack of action, poor policy, failure to enforce policy, laziness, negligence, apathy, or violations of their civil rights – it is the children who suffer, often catastrophically. Our mission is to fight these injustices, holding those responsible accountable and giving these vulnerable children a real chance at the future they deserve.

 How have you used advancing technology to approach complex cases?

 We are always on the lookout for advances that will help us deliver our message effectively. We recently took advantage of developments in animation, working with medical experts to help create a 3D anatomical depiction of the injuries one of our clients suffered as a result of persistent physical abuse. Rather than relying solely on records or still photographs, which can also be very demonstrative, we utilized experts to develop an interactive animation to help jurors visualize and understand the nature, location, aging and significance of our client’s injuries.

 The animation allowed us to bring the evidence to life, in vivid detail, and in a way that was consistent with the medical experts’ opinions, to demonstrate the severity of the trauma and injuries our clients suffered in a way that words and static images simply couldn’t. We were able to utilize it to help the other side understand what jurors were going to see, and it became a powerful tool that helped lead to a successful settlement, ensuring a better future for our client. Utilizing advances like these helps make complex issues understandable and compelling.
