 The Wyre, Woodfield Development’s newest mixed-use multifamily community in Asheville’s River Arts District, has officially unveiled a large-scale mural installation as part of its commitment to celebrating and preserving the neighborhood’s artistic identity.

 Spanning 66 feet wide and 7.5 feet tall, the vibrant eight-panel mural lines the façade of The Wyre along Clingman Avenue, bringing public-facing art to the heart of the district. Commissioned by Woodfield Development and curated by local creative agency Artsville Collective, the mural explores themes of soul, nature, music, and memory, paying homage to Asheville’s rich cultural past and dynamic music scene.

 Selected from a pool of local and regional muralists, the three featured artists: Victor Palenque (Ishmael), Amar Stewart, and Oscar Montes (Trek6) each contributed their unique voice and vision to the series.

 

 Panels 1 & 8 were completed by Victor Palenque, (Ishmael). These highly realistic trompe l’oeil-style pieces depict a train line that journeys through time, layering futuristic elements like spacecraft windows and marble textures with whimsical touches, such as a cat at the starting point and a dog at the final car. Spray-painted musical notes line the train, anchoring the theme of sound.

 Panels 2, 4 & 6 showcase the work of Amar Stewart, a British-born, Asheville-based artist known for blending classic portraiture with hip-hop iconography. Stewart’s contributions honor legendary female soul artists with ties to the region, including Nina Simone, Gladys Knight, and Roberta Flack. His palette of deep blues evokes the nearby French Broad River while paying homage to the artists’ enduring legacies.

 Panels 3, 5 & 7 were brought to life by Oscar Montes, (Trek6), whose detailed renderings of bioluminescent hummingbirds convey a sense of nighttime wonder and movement. With a style rooted in airiness and intricate linework, his contributions offer a meditative contrast to the energy of the other panels.

 Additionally, the Wyre also boasts works from Judith Cheney, a renowned Asheville-based painter whose reproduction of The French Broad River in Asheville, NC: Past, Present & Future is prominently displayed in The Wyre’s Leasing Center, and artist Dumah Morgan, who painted a mural of local musician Warren Haynes for the Wyre’s recreation/pool room.

 These murals represent a broader set of cultural features at The Wyre, including an on-site art studio, spaces for art exhibitions and cultural events, and curated works by local artists. Inside the Leasing Center, a reproduction of Judith Cheney’s ‘The French Broad River in Asheville, NC: Past, Present & Future’ serves as a focal point, further anchoring the project to its roots in local history.

 The Wyre continues to support the River Arts District’s resurgence following the impact of Hurricane Helene. The mural installation stands as a visual symbol of that momentum, uniting local voices in a shared celebration of place, music, and art.
