 Meet the Local Franchise Owner:

 The new bar is owned and operated by local entrepreneur Ruchita Patel. Always having a dream of being a hair stylist, Patel went right to beauty school in New Jersey after graduating from Drexel University with a degree in management information systems. She spent the next couple of years working at a salon before deciding to return to the tech world, where she had a successful 18-year career with a large internet and security company. Following her corporate career, Patel felt it was the best time to bring her dream of owning her own beauty business to fruition.
