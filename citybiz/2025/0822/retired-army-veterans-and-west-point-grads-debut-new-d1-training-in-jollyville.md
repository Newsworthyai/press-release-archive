# Retired Army Veterans and West Point Grads Debut New D1 Training in Jollyville

D1 Training, a leading fitness enrichment concept utilizing the five core tenets of athletic-based training, opened location in Jollyville at 11521 N FM 620 on June 2. The group fitness facility employs a sports-science backed training regimen led by certified trainers to help people of all ages achieve their sport and fitness goals.

 Chané and Sandra Jackson join a roster of impressive existing franchisees, including professional athletes like Kylie Fitts and Jordan Gay. Additional D1 partners include NBA star Chris Paul and Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow.

 The duo are Army veterans who bring decades of leadership, discipline, and a deep passion for fitness to their new venture. Chané, a retired Green Beret and Army Ranger, graduated from West Point in 2004 and served as an Infantry officer before working his way to Special Forces Officer, with deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan before transitioning to teaching at West Point. With a master’s degree in Operations Research/Industrial Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin and an MBA from Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, he built a career in data science and the tech industry before returning to Austin in 2023.

 Sandra, a retired Military Intelligence officer and 2006 West Point graduate, completed a long deployment before earning a master’s degree in Operations Research/Industrial engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 2015. She later worked as a data scientist before retiring from the Army in 2023 and transitioning to the tech sector. The couple, who met at West Point and married in 2006, have three daughters, ages 14, 10, and 7.

 “As veterans, we understand the power of discipline, teamwork, and resilience, qualities that are essential for success both on and off the field,” said Sandra. “D1 Training provides young athletes with the structure, mentorship, and resources they need to build confidence, develop strong work ethics, and reach their full potential. We’re excited to have this proven training system in Jollyville to help shape the next generation through fitness and performance.”

 D1 Training offers four age-based programs including Rookie (ages 7-11), Developmental (ages 12-14), Prep (ages 15-18) and Graduate (18+). Each fitness program is based on the five athletic-based tenets: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down. Outside of group workouts, D1 Training offers team, semi-private (small group), and one-on-one training with world-class coaches. The goal is simple: train athletes who are dedicated to their sport or fitness goals, regardless of age, or athletic background.

 Strategically expanding across the nation through franchising, D1 Training has more than 100 performance centers open with over 100 additional locations in various stages of development. The brand is currently seeking financially qualified business builders, former athletes, and entrepreneurs, who share a passion for fitness and youth sports, and are ready to make a positive impact on their community.
