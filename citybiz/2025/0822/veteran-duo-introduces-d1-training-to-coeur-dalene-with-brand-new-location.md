# Veteran Duo Introduces D1 Training to Coeur d’Alene with Brand New Location

D1 Training, a leading fitness enrichment concept utilizing the five core tenets of athletic-based training, has opened a new location in Coeur d’Alene at 8632 N Government Way on June 9. The new group fitness facility employs a sports-science backed training regimen led by certified trainers to help people of all ages achieve their sport and fitness goals.

 

 Local entrepreneurs and veterans Richard Smith and Kyle Parkinson join a roster of impressive existing franchisees, including professional athletes like Kylie Fitts and Jordan Gay. Additional D1 partners include NBA star Chris Paul and Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow.

 

 “We’re incredibly excited to open this facility in a community we care deeply about,” said co-owner Richard Smith. “Our VIP Week is a chance to showcase not just the cutting-edge space, but the heart of D1—our people. From the first-class turf and equipment to our glass garage door and parent viewing bar, everything has been built with intentionality and excellence.”

 Smith, a former Division I wrestler with a background in exercise science and two decades of medical marketing experience, was inspired to bring D1 to Coeur d’Alene after witnessing the lack of structured, sports-science-based training for young athletes. He partnered with longtime friend Kyle Parkinson, a seasoned entrepreneur with a shared vision for equipping the next generation and building community through fitness.

 Backing their vision is a team of elite local talent, starting with Jake McNitt, General Manager and proud Idaho native. A lifelong athlete and father of two, McNitt brings both leadership and heart to the facility. JJ Njoku, a former collegiate football player and seasoned strength coach, leads with infectious energy and a passion for developing confident, high-performing athletes. McKaylee Sloane, Assistant General Manager and a hometown athlete herself, rounds out the team with a focus on creating an encouraging, team-driven atmosphere rooted in local connection and care.

 “Our team truly reflects the values of D1,” said co-owner Kyle Parkinson. “They’re not just experts—they’re mentors. They care about each athlete who walks through our doors, and they’re committed to helping people grow in strength, confidence, and purpose.

 D1 Training offers four age-based programs including Rookie (ages 7-11), Developmental (ages 12-14), Prep (ages 15-18) and D1 Adult. Each fitness program is based on the five athletic-based tenets: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down. Outside of group workouts, D1 Training offers group, semi-private, and one-on-one training with world-class coaches. The goal is simple: to continue to train athletes who are dedicated to their sport or fitness goals, regardless of age, or athletic background.

 Strategically expanding across the nation through franchising, D1 Training has more than 100 performance centers open with over 100 additional locations in various stages of development. The brand is currently seeking financially qualified business builders, former athletes, and entrepreneurs, who share a passion for fitness and youth sports, who are ready to make a positive impact on their community.
