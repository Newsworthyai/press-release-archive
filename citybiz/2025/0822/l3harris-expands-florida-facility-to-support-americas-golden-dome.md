# L3Harris Expands Florida Facility to Support America’s Golden Dome

MELBOURNE, Fla.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–L3Harris Technologies has completed a $100 million expansion at its satellite integration and test facility in Palm Bay to support the Department of Defense’s (DOD) urgent need for on-orbit technology for the Golden Dome for America. L3Harris’ new investment in Florida adds to the existing capability of the Space Coast and will enable key components for this strategic capability to be delivered during President Trump’s second term.

 Elected officials, customers and business leaders participated in a ribbon-cutting ceremony today for the expanded 94,000-square-foot facility, designed to produce next-generation satellites that will identify, track and defend against hypersonic and advanced missile threats.

 “Accelerating the production of proven hardware for national missile warning and defense remains a priority as we align resources across the enterprise to support the President’s vision for America’s Golden Dome,” said Christopher E. Kubasik, Chair and CEO, L3Harris. “We continue to deliver advanced space-based technology with the speed and agility required to protect our homeland from advanced threats while bolstering U.S. manufacturing and continued investment in Florida.”

 L3Harris currently provides crucial missile warning and missile defense capabilities with five satellites on orbit and 34 satellites being developed for hypersonic missile tracking in support of the DOD’s current missile warning and missile defense architecture.

 “Thank you for what you do every day for our country. It’s so exciting to see a new facility opening in Palm Bay, Florida,” said U.S. Rep. Mike Haridopolos. “L3Harris is an instrumental leader, not just in space, but national defense, as you’re a vital part of the Golden Dome.”

 L3Harris has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure and manufacturing processes across the United States to deliver national defense capabilities at the pace and scale required.

 “Palm Bay is honored to be the home of this advanced facility, which plays a vital role in strengthening our national security and sustaining the technological edge that keeps our country safe,” said Palm Bay Mayor Rob Medina. “The investment by L3Harris not only supports key defense and space missions but also drives economic opportunity here at home through high-skill, high-wage jobs. We’re proud that Palm Bay is helping lead the way in supporting our nation’s readiness and innovation. L3Harris remains a valued partner in that mission and in the continued growth of our city.”

 L3Harris’ investments translate to more than 900,000 square feet of new and renovated advanced manufacturing space nationwide to support the production of space-based missile warning and defense technologies, precision fire-control sensing, targets, and propulsion and control systems for interceptors.
