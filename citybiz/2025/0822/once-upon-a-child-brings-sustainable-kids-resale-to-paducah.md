# Once Upon A Child Brings Sustainable Kids’ Resale to Paducah

Once Upon A Child®, the leading children’s clothing and accessories retail resale concept, recently opened its location in Paducah located at 3050 New Holt Rd. The brand is known for providing local parents with a place that not only puts cash back into their pockets, but sells gently used children’s clothing, shoes, toys, accessories and equipment for less.

 With a focus on being a sustainable shopping resource for local families, the new Once Upon A Child in Paducah opened on June 5. Once Upon A Child is part of Winmark – the Resale Company®, a unique national retail resale franchise that focuses on sustainability, small business formation and providing Resale for Everyone®.

 Meet the Local Owners

 Once Upon A Child Paducah is owned by husband-and-wife duo, David and Amberly Craig. The couple were introduced to Winmark through David’s family, who own multiple locations around Ohio and Pennsylvania. Inspired by the family’s success and seeing the need for more clothing options in the area, the Craigs opened Plato’s Closet back in 2015. Now, a decade later, they are expanding their footprint with the opening of Once Upon A Child.

 “After opening Plato’s Closet, Once Upon A Child has always been the next business we hoped to bring to the area,” said David. “With three kids of our own, we understand how few shopping options there are for baby and children’s clothing in Paducah. We’re excited to offer families an affordable, sustainable option while putting money back into the hands of local parents.”

 More about Once Upon A Child Paducah

 Once Upon A Child’s unique retail resale concept allows for clothing, toys and accessories for kids to end up in someone else’s house rather than thrown into a landfill, providing a resource for new or existing parents who are looking to update their children’s closet on a budget and in a mindful environmental manner.

 Unlike a typical consignment store, Once Upon A Child does not require appointments and pays on the spot for items it purchases from consumers. At Once Upon A Child families are able to buy necessities for their children at great values, and turn their gently used items into cash.

 In addition, Once Upon A Child ensures that all products purchased and sold meet mandatory and voluntary safety standards. Staff members stay up-to-date on current recalled items, immediately pulling all recalled products from shelves and making sure all items purchased are safety-checked to meet current standards.

 For questions on the buying process or store hours, the new Once Upon A Child can be reached at (270) 290-1891 or https://onceuponachild.com/locations/paducah-ky/.
