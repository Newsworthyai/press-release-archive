 “It’s an incredible honor to be recognized two years in a row,” said Andrew Costa, Managing Director & Co-Founder. “We believe our growth reflects the trust our clients place in us and our dedication to standing by them through every stage of retirement.”

 Grant Conness, Managing Director & Co-Founder, added, “We focus on delivering customized strategies and building lasting relationships that support our clients throughout every stage of retirement.”

 GWM serves retirees and pre-retirees through five office locations in Fort Lauderdale, Weston, Coral Springs, Boynton Beach (serving the Boca Raton and Palm Beach areas), and Sarasota.
