# Homes Are Going Fast for Avery Point’s New Residence Buildings

To meet the growing demand for maintenance-free retirement living, Avery Point, an Erickson Senior Living-managed community in Short Pump, Va., is expanding its selection of residences and amenities in 2025.

 The community added to its array of independent living homes with the opening of Preston Woods in July and the scheduled opening of Harden Creek in September. The new resident buildings feature 201 stunning homes with a variety of one or two-bedroom designs with bright, open floor plans.

 “Interest in Avery Point is as great as ever,” said Executive Director Bryan Bee. “We’re thrilled to offer more homes in our vibrant community, giving even more people the chance to experience our active, maintenance-free, and affordable retirement lifestyle.”

 All homes will have convenient access to the community’s amenities, thanks to the climate-controlled walkways that connect the buildings to Avery Point’s clubhouses. Because Harden Creek is connected directly to Preston Woods, its residents will be close to the two newest restaurants on campus: Cork and Fork and The Cardinal.

 

 Cork and Fork is a grill-style restaurant, and The Cardinal has a bar environment with a pub-style menu. Both places feature both indoor and outdoor seating.

 Preston Woods also houses the Life Enrichment Center. This multipurpose room can accommodate about two hundred residents and includes a stage in the front, for shows or lectures, and space in the back, featuring a pickleball court–if the weather isn’t ideal for pickleball on the outdoor court.

 “Our residence buildings have a history of selling out within the first few months,” says Sales Director Kailey Viray. “If you can see yourself moving within the next year, I highly recommend talking with a member of the sales team sooner than later.”

 Since opening in 2022, Avery Point has established itself as the area’s premier senior living community by offering maintenance-free apartment homes and an array of amenities and activities.

 Every stunning apartment home at Avery Point has convenient access to resort-like amenities, including a swimming pool, state-of-the-art fitness center, theater, salon, on-site medical center, restaurants featuring chef-prepared cuisine, library, clubs, walking paths, and more.
