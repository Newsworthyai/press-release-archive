# Sheila Y. Oliver Foundation Hosts Second Annual Legacy Brunch Celebrating Women’s Leadership

Event Featured Award-Winning Actress Tisha Campbell, Honored Nine Trailblazing Women Leaders, and Commemorated Lt. Governor Sheila Y. Oliver’s Lasting Impact

 Sheila Y. Oliver Foundation (formerly Sheila Y. Oliver Civic Association) hosted the second annual Sheila Y. Oliver Legacy Brunch on Saturday, July 26, 2025, at the Valley Regency in Clifton, New Jersey. Over 350 guests across government, business, and community organizing came together to honor the extraordinary life and legacy of the late Lieutenant Governor Sheila Y. Oliver and celebrate influential New Jersey women leaders.

 Proceeds from the event will directly support Sheila Y. Oliver Foundation’s mission to empower underserved communities and cultivate the next generation of women leaders in government, public policy, and community organizing.

 “Each of today’s nine awardees is being recognized for leading with the kind of integrity, compassion, and tenacity that Sheila so deeply admired and modeled every day,” said Governor Phil Murphy. “Your work carries forward her mission to deliver lasting progress, and it proves that Sheila’s legacy isn’t behind us–it’s alive and well in the work still shaping New Jersey today.”

 Actress, singer, and comedian Tisha Campbell delivered a powerful keynote address that drew on her New Jersey roots.

 “I am a proud daughter of Newark,” said Campbell. “I grew up in a time where our city was a completely underserved city. But our amazing city, with its amazing people, had a secret weapon. We had leaders like Sheila Oliver who fought tirelessly for us. She was a true trailblazer for us, whose courage, vision, and commitment to public service inspired her constituents and communities.”

 Essex County Commissioner A’Dorian Murray-Thomas kept the program moving with grace and enthusiasm as Mistress of Ceremonies.

 The following honorees were awarded for their extraordinary work in their communities, carrying forward Sheila Y. Oliver’s legacy of compassionate action:
