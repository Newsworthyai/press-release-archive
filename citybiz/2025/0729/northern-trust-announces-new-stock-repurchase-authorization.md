# Northern Trust Announces New Stock Repurchase Authorization

CHICAGO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–On July 22, 2025, the Board of Directors of Northern Trust Corporation approved a new common stock repurchase authorization (the “New Stock Repurchase Authorization”) authorizing, but not obligating, the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion (the “Maximum Program Amount”) of the Corporation’s outstanding shares of common stock from time to time. The New Stock Repurchase Authorization replaces the previously announced authorization approved on October 19, 2021, for which there had been approximately 4.8 million shares of remaining repurchase capacity as of the date of the New Stock Repurchase Authorization after taking into account 572,709 shares repurchased between July 1, 2025 and the date of the New Stock Repurchase Authorization. All funds expected in connection with repurchases after the New Stock Repurchase Authorization shall count against the Maximum Program Amount. The New Stock Repurchase Authorization has no expiration date. Thus, the Corporation retains the ability to repurchase when circumstances warrant and applicable regulation permits.

 The Corporation expects to acquire shares of common stock under the New Stock Repurchase Authorization through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions, and/or pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted by the Corporation’s management in accordance with federal securities laws from time to time, including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing and actual number of shares of common stock repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, market conditions, and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities. The New Stock Repurchase Authorization does not obligate the Corporation to acquire a specific dollar amount or number of shares and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time.
