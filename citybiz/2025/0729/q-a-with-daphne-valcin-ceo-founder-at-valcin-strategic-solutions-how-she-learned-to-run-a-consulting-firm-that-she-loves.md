# Q&amp;A with Daphne Valcin, CEO &amp; Founder at Valcin Strategic Solutions: How She Learned to Run a Consulting Firm That She Loves

Daphne Valcin is a consultant and executive coach who specializes in working with senior leaders and leadership teams. After spending her first year in business coaching clients towards their goals across a broad range of topics, she honed in on her focus by learning more about what her target market’s more urgent needs were and by clarifying what she genuinely enjoyed supporting clients with most. Now she provides one-on-one and team coaching, team development consulting, and corporate, helping clients to increase their influence and impact up, down, and across their organizations.

 Don’t be afraid to narrow your focus.

 Tell us about your journey into executive coaching.

 I started my career in public relations, nonprofit management, and held a number of leadership roles, which really gave me a front-row seat to the challenges leaders face every day. When I launched my coaching practice, I worked with clients on a wide range of goals, but over time, I realized I was most energized by helping senior leaders and teams grow their impact and influence. That led me to focus more intentionally on executive and team coaching, team development consulting, and corporate training. Now I get to help leaders show up more powerfully and lead more effectively across every level of their organization.

 What were some of your biggest hurdles early on?

 One of the biggest challenges I faced early on was figuring out where to turn for the right guidance to grow my business in a sustainable way. I knew I needed to strengthen my approach, especially in sales and marketing. I spent several months listening to free webinars about business growth when I first started my business, but I still wasn’t very clear about how to effectively grow my business. Eventually, I made the decision to invest in a business coach, and that changed everything. With support and practical guidance, I was able to clarify my goals, establish a consistent sales and marketing plan, and implement operational structures for coaching that helped create more stability for both me and my clients.

 How important have systems been to your success?

 Discipline and systems have been essential for keeping up with running my business. I’ve tried around 40 different tools in my career to find better ways to invoice, track time and tasks, and monitor my sales pipeline. But the two that remain the most valuable and consistent for me are Wave and Trello. They’re simple and extremely helpful to my business. Wave also has a great advisor, Annika, who I can rely on for counsel on my business bookkeeping when I need it. Where I used to feel that business finance was super complex, Wave has made me feel extremely clear on how to track, maintain, and even enhance my approach to my business accounting.

 What types of clients typically come to you?

 I typically work with senior leaders, executives, and leadership teams, many of whom are navigating complex organizational challenges or preparing for their next level of influence and impact. Some are looking to strengthen team dynamics, improve communication, or shift culture, while others are focused on strategic clarity, confidence, or stepping into senior or C-Suite roles. I also support business owners who are often building or scaling service-based businesses. I help them to grow with greater structure, sustainability, and intention. Across the board, my clients are high-achieving, purpose-driven, and ready to lead with greater alignment and results.

 What do you love most about the coaching work?

 There’s something powerful about creating a space for reflection and helping people build systems, acquire tools, and gain insights that truly support their goals. Working with senior leaders is especially rewarding because they’re always juggling so much, and helping them find focus and gain clarity on their best path forward can be transformative for them and those around them.

 Any advice for other entrepreneurs trying to find their niche?

 Pay attention to what clients need most, not what you think you would most like to be offering. And notice what you genuinely enjoy doing – that intersection is often where you’ll find your momentum. Don’t be afraid to narrow your focus. When I discovered the target market I was truly passionate about serving, I took the time to understand what would be most valuable to them, and committed to continuously growing in how I supported them, everything shifted. Not only did my business grow more consistently, but more people were positively impacted as a result of that clarity and intentionality.
