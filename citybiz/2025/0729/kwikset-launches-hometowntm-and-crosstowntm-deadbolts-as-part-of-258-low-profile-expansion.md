# Kwikset Launches Hometown™ and Crosstown™ Deadbolts as Part of 258 Low Profile Expansion

Kwikset®, a trusted leader in residential security and a registered trademark of ASSA ABLOY Americas Residential Inc., an ASSA ABLOY Group Company, today introduced two new additions to its Signature Series line: the 258 Hometown and Crosstown low profile deadbolts. These new deadbolts combine elevated design with Kwikset’s SmartKey Security® for a stylish and secure entryway solution.

 With the introduction of the round Hometown and rectangular Crosstown deadbolts, Kwikset expands the 258 low profile deadbolt collection to match an even wider range of architectural styles — from classic to contemporary. Designed to complement Kwikset knobs and levers, both refined traditional models offer a clean, streamlined silhouette with the reliable performance customers expect.

 Each 258 deadbolt features a sleek, low profile exterior that blends seamlessly with the door surface, creating a modern yet approachable look. Available in Satin Nickel, Satin Brass and Matte Black finishes — with Hometown also offered in Venetian Bronze — homeowners can easily coordinate with other hardware in the Kwikset portfolio for a cohesive aesthetic. Select finishes also include Microban® antimicrobial protection, keeping surfaces 99.9% cleaner than unprotected hardware.

 Both Hometown and Crosstown feature Kwikset’s patented SmartKey Security technology, which protects against advanced break-in techniques and allows homeowners to re-key the lock in seconds — providing unmatched flexibility and peace of mind.

 The 258 deadbolts are Certified Grade AAA by the Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association (BHMA) for security, durability and finish. They offer trusted quality and hassle-free installation using a standard screwdriver. The designs fit standard door thicknesses of 1-3/8″ to 1-3/4″ and include an adjustable latch to accommodate various backset configurations.

 “The expansion of our 258 series with Hometown and Crosstown gives homeowners more ways to enhance their front doors with timeless design and proven protection,” said Amanda Archer, group manager of product marketing at Kwikset. “Whether your style is traditional or transitional, these new deadbolts offer a refined look that doesn’t compromise on security.”

 The 258 Hometown and Crosstown deadbolts are now available through Kwikset’s professional distribution network — starting at $39.49 for Hometown and $44.49 for Crosstown — with rollout to major retailers and online platforms coming soon.
