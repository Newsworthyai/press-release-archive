# Q&amp;A with Melissa Sarhan, Owner of FYZICAL Therapy &amp; Balance Centers in Glendale

Melissa Sarhan, owner of FYZICAL Therapy & Balance Center in Downtown Glendale, is an Advanced Practice Registered Nurse with over 20 years of experience caring for adults and seniors. She is board certified as an Adult Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner by the American Nurses Credentialing Center and has dedicated her career to helping individuals take charge of their health and live life on their own terms.

 Melissa earned her bachelor’s degree in nursing from the University of Arkansas in 2004 and her master’s degree from Vanderbilt University in 2007. Over the years, she has practiced in a wide range of healthcare settings, including clinics, skilled nursing facilities, patients’ homes, and university health centers. She spent a decade with Kaiser Permanente, where she held multiple leadership roles and developed a reputation for clinical excellence and patient advocacy.

 A member of the Obesity Medicine Association, Melissa is passionate about preventive care and proactive approaches to health—particularly in addressing fall risk and balance issues among older adults. She saw a critical gap in traditional care models, which often focused on treatment only after an injury occurred. Opening her own FYZICAL Therapy & Balance Center gave her the opportunity to change that, bringing evidence-based fall prevention and functional wellness programs to the Phoenix community.

 In addition to her clinical work, Melissa serves as Graduate Faculty and Success Manager for the College of Nursing and Health Care Professions at Grand Canyon University. She and her family relocated to Phoenix about a year ago and have embraced the local culture and sunshine, though she still misses the rain back in Washington. Outside of work, she enjoys spending time with her family and pets, kickboxing, traveling, and listening to audiobooks.

 Can you tell us a bit about your journey before FYZICAL and how those experiences shaped your leadership style?

 Before opening FYZICAL, I spent over 20 years as a Nurse Practitioner, primarily in internal medicine and post-acute care. I cared for countless patients recovering from falls, fractures, and hospitalizations—many of whom had underlying balance or vestibular issues that were never fully addressed. I saw firsthand how a lack of preventative care led to unnecessary decline, loss of independence, and fear.

 Those years instilled in me a deep respect for comprehensive, proactive care—and they shaped my leadership style into one rooted in collaboration, clarity, and compassion. I believe in hiring good humans first, then building skill. I aim to create a team culture where people feel seen, supported, and excited about the work they do.

 What is your vision for your FYZICAL over the next five years?

 Over the next five years, I want our FYZICAL center to become the destination for balance, vestibular, and fall prevention care in our region—and a true community resource. I envision expanding our team, building strong referral partnerships, and integrating even more deeply with medical and functional providers to offer seamless care.

 I also see us as a training ground for excellence—developing mentorship pathways for staff and hosting community events to empower older adults to stay strong, mobile, and independent.

 What makes FYZICAL different from other clinics?

 FYZICAL stands out because we don’t just treat symptoms—we solve root problems. We focus on proactive care, not just reactive rehab. Our comprehensive balance testing, specialized equipment, and multidisciplinary model allow us to tailor treatment with incredible precision.

 But more than that, it’s the heart behind the care. Our patients feel it. We celebrate their wins—big and small—and build genuine relationships. We’re not just helping them recover; we’re helping them reclaim their lives.

 What’s one lesson you’ve learned since opening the center that you think every new entrepreneur should know?

 Don’t wait for perfect. Clarity comes through action. There will never be a moment when you feel completely ready, and there will always be problems to solve. Open the doors. Show up. Learn fast. Course correct. And above all—stay grounded in your why.

 Were there any challenges or unexpected moments during the process of opening your center?

 Many! From construction delays to navigating new software to staffing curveballs—we faced plenty of obstacles. But the biggest challenge was learning how to lead a business while still caring deeply about people. It’s a different mindset, and it requires daily reflection.

 One unexpected moment that stands out: a patient that we had been working with looked at me and said “I had a stroke years ago and I have been looking for therapy like this for five years. I have finally found what I was looking for.”

 What kind of impact do you hope to have on the patients who walk through your doors?

 I want every patient who walks through our doors to feel safe, empowered, and hopeful. I want them to know they’re not “just getting older”—they’re capable of more than they think.

 Our goal is to restore not just function, but freedom. If we can help someone walk without fear, dance at their grandchild’s wedding, or stay living in their own home—we’ve done our job.
