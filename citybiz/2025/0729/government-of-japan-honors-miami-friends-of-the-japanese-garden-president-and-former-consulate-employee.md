 Mr. Richard Del Vecchio, originally from Brooklyn, became involved with the Japanese community in Miami in 2005 after meeting Agnes Youngblood, the first President of the Miami Friends of the Japanese Garden. That same year, he helped organize “Kagoshima Miami Day,” an event at Miami-Dade College that welcomed a delegation from Kagoshima City, strengthening the sister city ties between Miami and Kagoshima. His strategic public relations efforts, including securing support from Armstrong Toyota, helped promote Japanese culture and products in South Florida. In 2010, Mr. Del Vecchio began working more closely with the Miami Friends of the Japanese Garden to expand its cultural festivals. After becoming President in 2011, he led the organization in promoting Japanese culture through festivals, partnerships, and community outreach. His ongoing efforts have helped deepen local understanding of Japan and foster lasting ties between Japan and South Florida.

 Mr. Ernest Aguiar joined the Consulate General of Japan in Miami in 1998 and served as Senior Political Analyst in the Political and Economic Section until his retirement in June 2024, dedicating over 26 years to strengthening Japan-Florida relations. With deep expertise in U.S. and Latin American political and economic affairs, he played a vital role in analysis, project coordinator, and maintaining key networks throughout the region. His long-standing dedication was recognized with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ (MOFA) Long-Service award in both 2009 and 2018.

 The Consulate General of Japan in Miami extends its heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Del Vecchio and Mr. Aguiar on receiving these distinguished honors. Through their steadfast dedication, whether by promoting cultural exchange or supporting diplomatic efforts, they have helped to build lasting bridges between our peoples and enriched the relationship in meaningful and enduring ways. The Government of Japan expresses its deepest appreciation for their invaluable service and looks forward to the continued growth of these meaningful ties.
