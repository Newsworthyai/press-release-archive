# Blackpoint Cyber and CyberFOX Announce Strategic Partnership

Blackpoint Cyber, the world’s fastest and most effective Managed Detection and Response (MDR) provider, today announced a strategic partnership with CyberFOX, a global cybersecurity software provider. Through this alliance, CyberFOX will become an official reseller of Blackpoint’s cybersecurity solutions, enabling partners to access a bundled offering of world-class threat detection and response with identity-centric security from a single provider.

 As part of the agreement, all Blackpoint Cyber offerings will be available through CyberFOX. The combined solution delivers integrated protection that stops cyberattacks at every stage, from credential abuse to lateral movement and privilege escalation, all while streamlining compliance workflows for regulatory standards such as HIPAA and GDPR.

 “Blackpoint was built to give defenders an advantage,” said Tim Sheahen, Senior Vice President of Sales at Blackpoint Cyber. “We’re proud to partner with CyberFOX to expand access to our platform and bring our real-time threat detection and response capabilities together with world-class PAM. This partnership reflects our shared belief in simplicity, interoperability, and delivering real security outcomes for partners and their clients.”

 “At CyberFOX, we believe security should be effective, affordable, and easy to manage,” said Adam Slutskin, Chief Revenue Officer at CyberFOX. “By partnering with Blackpoint, we’re giving our partners the ability to consolidate tools, reduce alert fatigue, and improve incident response, all while protecting privileged accounts and credentials. We’re excited to deliver this ‘better together’ experience to our growing partner ecosystem.”

 In addition to bundled solution access, Blackpoint will provide all CyberFOX partners with dedicated technical support and resources, helping partners onboard quickly and maximize value. The partnership builds on the companies’ shared commitment to improving cybersecurity resilience for MSPs by reducing risk through consolidation, automation, and enhanced visibility.
