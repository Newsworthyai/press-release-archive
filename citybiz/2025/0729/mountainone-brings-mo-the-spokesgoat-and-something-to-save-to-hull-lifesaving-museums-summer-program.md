# MountainOne Brings Mo The Spokesgoat And “Something to Save” To Hull Lifesaving Museum’s Summer Program

Local families enjoyed a special visit from MountainOne during the Hull Lifesaving Museum’s Summer Adventure program, where kids gathered for a story time featuring “Something to Save,” the second book in MountainOne’s original storybook series.

 The story follows Mo the Spokesgoat and his friend Penny the Chipmunk as they learn about saving money, planning ahead, and making thoughtful choices. The book is part of MountainOne’s growing Storybook Program, designed to help children build early financial awareness in a fun, approachable way.

 Community Banking Officers Devon Stone (Scituate) and Meghan Dunphy (Rockland), along with Universal Banker Chris Barber from MountainOne’s Scituate branch, led the reading and shared the story with the group. Kids were invited to think about what they might save for and how setting goals can help make dreams possible.

 The morning’s highlight was a visit from Mo the Spokesgoat himself, who brought smiles, high-hooves, and plenty of photo opportunities.

 “Such a fun morning with the kids and their families at the Hull Lifesaving Museum,” said Meghan Dunphy.

 “It’s always a pleasure to bring Mo into the community,” added Devon Stone. “These events are a great way to introduce kids to the basics of saving in a way that is engaging and relatable.”
