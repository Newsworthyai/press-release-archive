# Benihana Express Opens Second Location in Miami

DENVER–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The ONE Group Hospitality, announces the opening of its newest Benihana Express location in the Bayside Marketplace shopping center (401 Biscayne Blvd S119) in Miami. Owned and operated by franchisee Erick Passo, the restaurant is the second location in the Miami area – the first having opened earlier this year in the Brickell neighborhood – and is a new hibachi concept that features guest-favorite menu elements from Benihana in a made-to-order, fast casual format. As part of a multi-unit development deal with Passo, The ONE Group anticipates opening additional Benihana Express locations under this agreement in the coming months.

 “Benihana Express and franchises are key components of our overall growth strategy, both for the Benihana brand and The ONE Group as a whole,” said Emanuel “Manny” Hilario, CEO of The ONE Group. “Since Benihana joined The ONE Group’s VIBE dining platform, we’ve been looking for ways to bring the excitement and world-class flavor profiles of the Benihana dining experience to an asset-light, franchise-forward model. Erick Passo is a fantastic partner, and we are thrilled to work alongside him to introduce more people in Miami to Benihana Express. We have many additional development deals in the pipeline and should be announcing them shortly.”

 The 770-square-foot fast casual concept reflects a modern, minimalist aesthetic with Japanese-inspired touches – from sleek, wood finishes and bold, red accents to an open kitchen concept (in a much smaller footprint) that mirrors the energy, excitement and renowned teppanyaki experience that guests have come to love from Benihana, now in a more casual, fast casual atmosphere.

 The Benihana Express menu features the best of Benihana from appetizers to add-ons, including:

 * Hibachi Burritos – The newest offering from Benihana, guests can select either steak, shrimp or chicken prepared with hibachi fried rice and teriyaki sauce, all wrapped in a soft, flour tortilla
* Hibachi Entrees – Choose from colossal shrimp, chicken, NY strip steak, filet mignon or a combination of all four, prepared with sesame seeds and served with mushrooms and hibachi chicken rice
* Hibachi Yakisoba Bowls – From steak, shrimp, chicken or simply sauteed vegetables, all yakisoba bowls are prepared with sesame seeds and served with Japanese sauteed noodles and mixed vegetables in a special sauce
* Hibachi Bowls – Shrimp, steak or chicken are prepared with sesame seeds and served over mushrooms and hibachi chicken rice
* Appetizers – From pork gyoza to edamame, Benihana salad to miso soup, there’s a little something for everyone to start their meal off right
* Add–ons – Make any dish bigger, better or bolder with a variety of add-ons, such as filet mignon, NY strip steak, chicken, shrimp or either a single or double serving of the Benihana classic hibachi chicken rice

 “Opening a second Benihana Express is a proud milestone for my family and me,” said franchisee Passo, who is also the owner of Black Market Miami and Ben’s Pizza. “We saw an opportunity to bring something fresh and exciting to the neighborhood – quality food, fast service and a brand people already love. This location reflects our commitment to growing with the community and delivering a memorable experience in a quick-service setting, and we can’t wait to introduce even more people to this amazing concept when we open our third Benihana Express location in Miami later this year.”

 The new Benihana Express will be open daily from 11 a.m. until midnight.

 Following the openings in Miami, Benihana Express is slated to open its first West Coast operation in San Francisco later this year. For more information on additional franchising or licensing opportunities with The ONE Group, please visit togrp.com/licensee-inquiry-form.
