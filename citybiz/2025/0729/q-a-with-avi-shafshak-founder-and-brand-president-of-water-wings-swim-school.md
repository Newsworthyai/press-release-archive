# Q&amp;A with Avi Shafshak, Founder and Brand President of Water Wings Swim School

Avi Shafshak and his wife Tracy opened the first Water Wings Swim School in Las Vegas in 2003 to address the critical safety need for high-quality swim education. What began as a passion project rooted in their combined backgrounds in swim instruction, child psychology and business has grown into an established and trusted name in swim education, with 13 corporate-owned locations operating across four states.

 Now, with its recent acquisition by Unleashed Brands—the premier youth enrichment company behind brands like Urban Air, The Little Gym and Sylvan Learning—Water Wings has launched a national franchise program and has already signed on a handful of new franchisees. As Brand President, Avi is leading the charge into this next phase of growth, overseeing operations and curriculum innovation.

 What inspired you and your wife to start Water Wings Swim School, and how did your background in swim instruction and business shape the early vision for the brand?

 My wife Tracy and I started Water Wings Swim School because we saw a critical need for quality swim education, especially for young children. Drowning is the leading cause of accidental death for kids under four, and we wanted to change that.

 With my background in business, swim instruction and school management, and Tracy’s experience as a competitive swimmer, coach and child psychology expert, we knew we could build something that not only teaches vital safety skills but also builds confidence and creates joyful memories in the water.

 When we opened our first location in 2003 at a private school in Las Vegas, our mission was to make swimming fun, engaging and accessible. That same mission guides us today as we expand to reach more communities nationwide.

 How does Water Wings differentiate itself from other swim schools?

 What sets us apart is our dual commitment to exceptional programming and franchisee success. We offer year-round swim instruction for all ages, from baby pool time and swim camps to recreational teams. That creates multiple revenue streams and a well-rounded experience for families. Our model is designed for accessibility, with lower buildout costs than many other swim school franchises and flexible ownership options, including remote management, making it easier for entrepreneurs to get started and grow.

 As a member of the United States Swim School Association, we take great pride in upholding the highest standards in aquatic education. And now that we’re backed by Unleashed Brands, we have even more tools at our disposal—advanced technology, marketing support and a strong network—to help our franchisees succeed and bring lifesaving swim instruction to more communities across the country.

 How has your partnership with Unleashed Brands shaped your growth strategy?

 Partnering with Unleashed Brands has given us the tools and support to scale Water Wings in a way that aligns with our mission and values. Their proven platform, backed by decades of experience in the youth enrichment space, has strengthened our growth strategy by providing access to advanced technology, marketing systems and operational expertise. Unleashed Brands’ mission to help kids learn, play and grow is at the core of everything they do, and it’s a perfect fit for what we’re building at Water Wings. With their support, we’ve launched a national franchise program that allows us to expand thoughtfully and efficiently, bringing lifesaving swim instruction to more communities while maintaining the quality and care that defines our brand.

 Since launching the national franchise program in May, you’ve already signed 8 franchise agreements in 60 days. To what do you attribute this success?

 We’ve seen incredible early momentum since launching the Water Wings franchise program two months ago, and that success comes down to a combination of trust, experience and mission. Seven of those new franchisees are already part of the Unleashed Brands family, which speaks volumes about their confidence in both our platform and our purpose. The eighth is a brand-new operator who saw the strength of our model and chose to join the network. I think this early traction is a testament to our proven swim program, a compelling and accessible franchise opportunity and a dedicated team focused on partnering with passionate entrepreneurs who believe in advancing our mission.

 What factors do you look for in a potential Water Wings franchisee, and how are you supporting them for long-term success?

 At Water Wings, we look for franchise partners who are passionate about community impact, strong leadership and growing a mission-driven business. We want individuals who are motivated to help kids build confidence and learn lifesaving skills through swim instruction. To support long-term success, we offer a proven, accessible model with lower buildout costs, flexible ownership options including remote management, and multiple revenue streams like camps, clinics and recreational swim programs. Our team provides comprehensive training and ongoing operational support—I stay closely involved in guiding the brand, improving customer experience and managing the new school opening process.

 Looking ahead—What’s next on the horizon for Water Wings?

 We are just getting started. Our vision is to bring Water Wings to more communities that need high-quality swim education, where children can not only learn lifesaving skills but also build confidence and a lifelong love for the water. We know there are families in so many communities nationwide that are looking for year-round swim lessons close to home but are unable to find any to meet their needs – this is what we are looking to change.

 We are focused on thoughtfully expanding into new markets while keeping our mission at the heart of everything we do. Each new location allows us to reach more families, prevent more tragedies, and help kids grow stronger and more self-assured.

 Equally important, we are building a network of passionate franchise partners who share our commitment to making a difference. Together, we are creating places where families feel supported, where kids feel proud of what they accomplish, and where communities can come together around something truly meaningful.
