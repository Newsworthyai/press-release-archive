# Greysteel Secures $14.91 Million Refinancing for Hilton Garden Inn Green Bay

Greysteel announced today the successful refinancing of the Hilton Garden Inn Green Bay, a recently renovated, 125-key, select-service hotel located in the heart of the Lambeau Field Stadium District. Developed in 2000 by Beechwood Hotel Group, a trusted leader in hospitality development and management, the property has been owned and operated by the group for over 20 years, serving as a cornerstone of Green Bay’s hospitality landscape.

 The $14.91 million First Perm Loan, provided by Fox Communities Credit Union, offers a floating rate structure that allows the cost of capital to decrease as the Federal Reserve cuts rates. This refinancing was completed ahead of the property’s CMBS loan maturity, avoiding potentially costly penalties and securing favorable terms for the borrower. The loan also features a more flexible covenant structure, providing Beechwood Hotel Group with increased operational flexibility to support their long-term goals.

 Located just steps from historic Lambeau Field, the Resch Center, and a variety of restaurants, retail, and major attractions, the Hilton Garden Inn Green Bay is ideally positioned to serve both leisure and business travelers. Its recent renovations have further enhanced the guest experience, solidifying its reputation as a premier hospitality destination in the region.

 “This was a highly attractive opportunity for lenders, given the property’s prime location, strong performance, and Beechwood Hotel Group’s long-standing ownership and management,” said Stephen Haase, who represented Beechwood Hotel Group in the transaction. “We’re thrilled to have secured a loan structure that not only meets their current needs but positions them for future success. Completing the refinancing ahead of the CMBS maturity was critical, and we’re proud to have delivered a seamless solution.”

 “The financing market for well-performing hotels in prime locations remains robust, as evidenced by the competitive term sheets received from a variety of lending sources,” added Haase.

 Fox Communities Credit Union, a local lender with a growing presence in Wisconsin, demonstrated their commitment to supporting the state’s hospitality sector by partnering on this transaction.

 The Hilton Garden Inn Green Bay continues to play a vital role in the Lambeau Field Stadium District, offering guests unparalleled access to Green Bay’s most iconic attractions.
