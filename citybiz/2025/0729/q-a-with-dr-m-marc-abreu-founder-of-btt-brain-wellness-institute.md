# Q&amp;A with Dr. M. Marc Abreu, Founder of BTT Brain Wellness Institute

Dr. Marc Abreu, is a distinguished figure in the medical field, renowned for his groundbreaking work in treating cancer and neurological disorders through the innovative use of brain thermodynamics and thermoregulatory frequencies. His academic journey includes an impressive array of qualifications:

 * Dr. Abreu undertook an extensive educational path, which included studies in medicine and physics, a residency, specialized training, and postdoctoral research at top universities including Nobel Prize-awarded Indiana University, University of Pittsburgh, Harvard University, and Yale University. Served as a faculty at both Harvard and Yale Medical Schools, contributing significantly to medical education, patient care and cutting-edge research in the USA.
* Made a pioneering discovery at Yale University: the brain thermal tunnel (BTT). This revolutionary finding enabled, for the first time in history, the continuous and non-invasive monitoring of human brain temperature.
* Holds patents for the BTT technology, a testament to his innovative spirit and dedication to advancing medical science.
* Created the first FDA-approved computer system specifically designed to monitor temperature during critical medical procedures, such as surgeries, enhancing patient safety and procedural outcomes.
* It was the first to delineate the radiation signature of the glucose molecule (resulting in US Patent # 7403805).
* His BTT technology was selected by the US Federal Government to receive the qualifying Therapeutic Discovery Project Grant, which includes the technology with the potential to kill cancer in 30 years.
* Crafted State-of-the-Art, Ultra-Precise Brain Thermodynamics Sensor in Collaboration with the US Naval Research Laboratory, Utilizing Advanced Navy Technology. While at Harvard University, Dr. Abreu engaged in a collaboration with the US Department of Defense and the US Air Force, focusing on the development of innovative, cutting-edge lasers equipped with advanced optical resonators.

 

 BTT Corp. recently opened the BTT Brain Wellness Institute in Aventura. What inspired the launch of this brain-focused facility?

 After decades of research at leading academic institutions here in the United States like Yale, Harvard, and Indiana University into how brain temperature and changes in brain temperature play a pivotal role in the health of the entire body, I wanted to create a space where people could access advanced, non-invasive solutions to optimize brain function that could to living better, healthier, and longer lives. The brain is at the center of everything, how we think, feel, sleep, and age… and yet most people don’t proactively take care of it or know how to take care of it. Our new clinic brings a science-based, personalized approach to brain wellness, using technologies we have developed in clinical and academic settings over the last twenty years.

 The center’s signature treatment is your patented brain-cooling technology. Can you explain what it is and who it’s for?

 The BTT brain-cooling protocol uses a proprietary method to lower brain temperature through the surface of the body. It’s a non-invasive treatment, lasting about 90 minutes, designed to improve brain function, reduce inflammation, and help regulate the nervous system. Many of our clients come to us struggling with sleep disorders, burnout, stress, or cognitive decline… or they’re simply high performers looking to gain a mental edge. We’ve also seen promising results in patients with Alzheimer’s, PTSD, and brain fog in our medical office.

 How is the BTT Brain Wellness Institute different from other wellness centers or IV clinics?

 We are the only Institute that harnesses the power of the brain. Most wellness centers offer generalized treatments, but our approach is rooted in decades of research and individualized care concerning the brain, the most essential organ. We look at brain health as the foundation of everything. Along with our brain-cooling sessions, we offer Brain Tap therapy, targeted IV protocols, and other neuro-optimizing modalities. Everything we do is designed to enhance neuroplasticity, restore balance, and improve quality of life from the inside out.

 Tell us a little about your background and what led you to this field.

 I’ve spent much of my career, spanning four decades, researching the intersection of brain temperature and systemic health. I served on the faculty at Yale University School of Medicine, where I developed the foundational science behind the BTT protocol. Over the years, I’ve worked with patients from around the world, ranging from individuals with neurodegenerative disease to elite athletes and CEOs.

 What kind of results have your patients experienced?

 The results vary depending on their condition, but we’ve seen improvements in cognitive clarity, deeper sleep, reduced anxiety, and even physical performance. For people with long-term brain fog or fatigue, the transformation can be life changing. The brain is incredibly adaptive, and when you help regulate its temperature and chemistry, remarkable things happen.

 Who would benefit from visiting the BTT Brain Wellness Institute?

 Anyone who wants to feel better, think more clearly, and age more gracefully and with more energy. We work with people of all ages, some come in to boost focus and productivity, others to get relief from insomnia, anxiety, or early signs of cognitive decline. Our goal is to create a long-term brain health plan that’s proactive, not reactive.

 What’s next for BTT Brain Wellness?

 A: We’re focused on building awareness around brain health and expanding access to our protocols. Aventura is just the beginning. We’re planning additional partnerships, as well as continuing clinical research. The more people understand that brain health can be enhanced, not just treated after something goes wrong, the more empowered they become to take control of their well-being.
