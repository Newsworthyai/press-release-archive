# The Atlanta Cup Announces Osaka, Sabalenka, Shelton and Kyrgios Headlining New Tennis Exhibition at Gas South Arena Dec. 6

World class tennis returns to Atlanta on Saturday, Dec. 6 as Gas South Arena hosts the debut of The Atlanta Cup. The inaugural tennis exhibition is set to feature four of the game’s most magnetic stars: Naomi Osaka, Aryna Sabalenka, Nick Kyrgios and Atlanta’s own Ben Shelton.

 The Atlanta Cup will unite global champions and fan favorites for a one-night-only event, while celebrating Atlanta’s status as the nation’s largest and most passionate tennis community. Headlining the women’s field and making their Atlanta debuts, Osaka, a four-time Grand Slam champion, will face the current world No. 1 and back-to-back US Open champion Aryna Sabalenka. With eight Grand Slams between them (Osaka: four, Sabalenka: four), the match will reignite a rivalry defined by raw power and contrasting styles. The Atlanta Cup will be the first time a No. 1 ranked female tennis player has competed in Atlanta since Lindsay Davenport at the 1997 U.S. Women’s Hard Court Championships.

 On the men’s side, Atlanta-born Ben Shelton – world No. 6 and one of tennis’ fastest-rising stars – will take on the explosive shotmaker and 2022 Wimbledon finalist Nick Kyrgios in their first-ever professional showdown. Fans can expect dynamic rallies, blistering serves and plenty of on-court personality as Shelton and Kyrgios bring firepower to the court.

 Atlanta’s tennis legacy runs deep. For decades, the city has welcomed top ATP and WTA talent, bringing world-class competition to local courts. USTA Atlanta is one of the largest community tennis associations in the country. Most recently, the Atlanta Open, founded by USTA Southern and the USTA, capped a 14-year run on the ATP Tour through 2024. Off the pro circuit, the Atlanta Lawn Tennis Association (ALTA), founded in 1934, has grown into the nation’s largest community tennis league. Now celebrating 91 years, ALTA continues to cement Atlanta’s status as one of America’s premier tennis hubs.

 “We’re proud to launch the inaugural Atlanta Cup, bringing four of the world’s most elite and beloved tennis stars to Atlanta,” said Jason Dolan, founder of The Atlanta Cup. “With well over 100,000 active league players in ALTA and USTA, Atlanta is the heartbeat of American tennis participation – and it once again has a marquee annual event that its legacy deserves.”

 The Atlanta Cup begins at 6 p.m. on Saturday, December 6, 2025. Tickets on sale now at ticketmaster.com Friday, Sept. 12 at 10 a.m. Fans can also visit theatlantacup.com and follow @TheAtlantaCup on Facebook, Instagram and X for updates.
