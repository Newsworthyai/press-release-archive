# Startups Take Center Stage on Go Fund Yourself Season 4: VALA and BlinC Games Redefine Digital Connection and Competition

The hit entrepreneurial reality series Go Fund Yourself returns tonight on Cheddar with another powerful episode spotlighting two startups pushing innovation across social media and sports entertainment. Season 4, Episode 2 introduces VALA, a next-generation social monetization app, and BlinC Games, an interactive platform merging sports and gaming for cash and charity competition.

 Created by Rory Cutaia, visionary entrepreneur and creator of Go Fund Yourself, the series merges the excitement of prime-time television with the real-world stakes of startup fundraising. Each week, entrepreneurs pitch their ideas to a panel of high-profile business leaders—known as The Titans—who bring decades of experience building and scaling multimillion- and billion-dollar companies.

 Joining Cutaia on the panel are Jayson Waller, bestselling author, powerhouse, and podcast host, and David Meltzer, globally recognized speaker, investor, and philanthropist. Together, they combine business mentorship with strategic investment insight, helping founders refine their pitch, navigate growth challenges, and connect with investors and audiences alike.

 VALA: Turning Social Media Into a Paycheck

 At the center of tonight’s episode, VALA is tackling one of the biggest challenges in today’s creator economy: fair compensation for user-generated content. The app enables users to earn from their posts and engagement, transforming social media interactions into real-world financial rewards.

 By integrating crypto connectivity and decentralized transaction systems, VALA is reimagining digital value exchange. Its mission is simple but revolutionary—give creators ownership over the attention they generate. In an era where major social platforms monetize user data and engagement, VALA’s model puts money and control back in the hands of its users.

 With the rise of competitive gaming and sports livestreaming, BlinC’s platform stands at the intersection of community, technology, and philanthropy. By making it easier for anyone to host or join tournaments—from pickup soccer games to eSports competitions—BlinC is creating a new space for athletes and gamers to connect on and off the field.
