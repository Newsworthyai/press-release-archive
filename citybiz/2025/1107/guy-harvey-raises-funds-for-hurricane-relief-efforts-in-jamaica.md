# Guy Harvey Raises Funds for Hurricane Relief Efforts in Jamaica

100% of profits from sales of specially designed, limited-edition t-shirt will benefit Food For The Poor-Jamaica

 World-renowned artist, conservationist, scientist and entrepreneur Dr. Guy Harvey has teamed up with Food For the Poor-Jamaica to help support ongoing relief efforts following Hurricane Melissa’s devastating impact throughout Jamaica.

 For a limited time, the special-edition “Big Up Jamaica” t-shirt, featuring original Guy Harvey artwork of a marlin and tuna over the Jamaican flag that celebrates the island’s strength and resilience, is available for purchase exclusively online at https://guyharvey.com/products/guy-harvey-big-up-jamaica-classic-t-shirt. Priced at $28, all profits from sales will be donated to Food for the Poor-Jamaica – a charity organization dedicated to transforming lives and restoring hope for the island’s most vulnerable communities. Through partnerships, donor support and on-going programs, Food for the Poor-Jamaica provides essential resources such as food, water, housing, medical aid and education support to families in need.

 “As a Jamaican native, this cause is incredibly important to me and I want to help out as much as I can,” said Dr. Harvey. “Hurricane Melissa displaced families, damaged communities and created urgent needs island-wide. By purchasing this shirt, people can directly help Food For the Poor-Jamica provide critical supplies, support rebuild efforts and bring relief to those who need it most.”

 About Guy Harvey: Guy Harvey is a unique blend of artist, scientist, diver, angler, conservationist, explorer and entrepreneur, fiercely devoted to his family and his love of the sea. His childhood passion for the ocean and its living creatures not only inspired him to draw but fueled a burning interest that prompted a formal education in marine science. Having graduated with honors in Marine Biology from Aberdeen University in Scotland in 1977, Guy returned home to Jamaica to resume his education, earning his Ph.D. from the University of the West Indies in 1984. Though he gave up a budding career as a marine biologist for that of a highly acclaimed artist, Guy has continued his relentless pursuit to unravel the mysteries of the sea, traveling the world to better understand the habits and habitats of the marine wildlife he paints. Guy is a recipient of the Simon Combes Award, and has been inducted into the Fishing, SCUBA Diving and Swimming Halls of Fame. The Guy Harvey coastal lifestyle brand brings the undersea world into everyday life through its merchandise offering including apparel, art, home goods and gift items that all help benefit marine conservation through the research and education work of the Guy Harvey Foundation. www.GuyHarvey.com.
