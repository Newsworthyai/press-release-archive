# Tint World® Celebrates Grand Opening in Carmel with High-End Tinting and Customization Services

Tint World® Automotive Styling Centers, a leading auto accessory and window tinting franchise, announced the grand opening of its newest store in Carmel, Indiana. Owned and operated by seasoned franchise entrepreneurs Ron Huling & Barney Storrs, Tint World® Carmel, IN brings premium automotive styling, protection, and performance services to one of the state’s most dynamic suburban markets. The location, at 9700 Lakeshore Dr E, Ste. 1, will celebrate its official grand opening on Saturday, November 8, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.

 The Carmel location offers a full range of Tint World®’s signature services, including window tinting, paint protection film (PPF), vinyl wraps, detailing, mobile electronics, remote starts, and ceramic coatings, positioning it as a one-stop destination for both automotive enthusiasts and everyday drivers across Carmel and the greater Indianapolis suburbs.

 Veterans of the franchise world, Huling & Storrs bring more than 40 years of experience in multi-unit operations. They, both former Planet Fitness franchise leaders, have owned and managed more than a dozen fitness centers across multiple states. After selling their fitness portfolio in 2022, they sought a new opportunity that combined growth potential, lifestyle balance, and trusted brand support – and Tint World® stood out.

 “When we discovered Tint World®, it immediately felt like the perfect fit for Carmel,” said Barney Storrs, owner of Tint World® Carmel, IN. “This community values quality, innovation, and local businesses that really care about their customers, and that’s what Tint World delivers. From enhancing the looks and comfort of family vehicles to outfitting luxury cars and supporting local dealerships and fleets, Tint World brings something for everyone in Carmel. It’s a brand that combines small-town service with big-brand expertise, and we’re excited to bring that to our neighbors.”

 The 7,500-square-foot facility marks the first of several stores Storrs and Huling plan to open under their multi-unit development agreement, which includes Zionsville and Noblesville, with discussions underway for further expansion in northern Indiana and Michigan.

 To celebrate its grand opening, Tint World® Carmel, IN will host a community event featuring:

 * 20% off all services
* Free ceramic coating with the purchase of a Supreme or Ultimate paint protection film package
* Raffle giveaways, including two $500 gift cards and a full interior/exterior detailing package
* Vendor displays, merchandise giveaways, and free food and drinks
* A classic car show and balloon artist for kids
* A donation drive benefiting the local Humane Society

 In addition to serving retail customers, Tint World® Carmel, IN is already developing partnerships with local dealerships, including Tom Wood Porsche, Penske Honda/Chevrolet, and Penske Collision Center, and plans to expand into fleet wrapping and municipal service work for local fire and police departments.

 “Barney and Ron’s track record as successful multi-unit operators perfectly aligns with Tint World®’s growth vision,” said Charles J. Bonfiglio, CEO of Tint World®. “Their leadership and commitment to operational success will help drive Tint World®’s continued success across the Midwest. We’re proud to welcome them and their team to the Tint World® family.”
