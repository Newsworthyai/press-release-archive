 Darshan Hiranandani, co-founder of Nidar and Director of Nidar’s largest shareholder, added: “Over the past year, Yotta has expanded partnerships with NVIDIA, Microsoft, leading central government institutions, large banks, enterprises and research institutes, delivered more than half of the GPU capacity to the IndiaAI Mission, and continued to pioneer sovereign cloud innovation through platforms like Shakti Cloud and Yntraa Cloud. As we move toward closing, we anticipate continuing to accelerate India’s role as a global hub for AI and high-performance computing.”
