# MobileX Offers Free Wireless Service to Customers Affected by End of SNAP Benefits

As millions of Americans face the suspension of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, MobileX today announced it will cover the cost of its customized wireless service for customers who have lost access to federal food assistance. The offer includes unlimited talk and text plus up to 2GB of data per month, which will be covered by MobileX for as long as SNAP benefits remain paused.1

 “As one of the few independent wireless carriers left, we believe in doing right by people, not just profits. If someone loses their SNAP benefits, we’ll cover a wireless plan for as long as their SNAP benefits are suspended,” said Peter Adderton, founder and CEO of MobileX. “Connectivity isn’t a luxury, it’s how families reach employers, schools and loved ones. We’re stepping up to make sure no one loses that lifeline because of government gridlock.”

 MobileX’s customizable, personalized access is uniquely positioned to address this need. Customers can easily download the MobileX app, customize their own plan via the Build Your Own tab and pay only for the data they need, on one of the fastest 5G networks in America. There is no need to go to a store or speak with a representative – customers can activate and start saving in minutes. Everyday options start as low as $3.48 a month.2

 New customers can activate service through the MobileX iOS/Android apps, mymobilex.com, Walmart.com or at more than 3,700 Walmart stores. Customers can choose to activate a new number or keep their current number by porting it into MobileX to receive the free service. New and existing customers can create a support ticket via the MobileX app or call customer care at 833-422-1053 to verify SNAP participation and receive free wireless service for the duration of the disruption of SNAP benefits.
