# Yossi Barishev on Redefining Leadership and Building Trust in AI

When Yossi Barishev joined hosts Noa Eshed and Ronen Menipaz on the Real Life Superpowers, the discussion moved far beyond a standard founder interview. It became a study in adaptability, conviction, and risk-taking in the fast-changing world of cybersecurity startups.

 Barishev, recognized by New York Tech Media and NewsBlaze as one of the rising leaders in cybersecurity, now leads a stealth-mode company redefining identity and trust in the age of artificial intelligence. His story captures a global shift in which experienced operators are leaving corporate stability to build mission-driven technologies that address the next wave of digital threats.

 Experience and Credibility as Core Assets in Cybersecurity

 Before entering stealth mode, Barishev spent years leading security operations and advising Fortune 500 firms through companies such as Sygnia and Fireblocks. That background gave him the credibility and perspective to launch his own venture. He believes the willingness to step into uncertainty repeatedly has fueled his personal and professional growth.

 This mindset aligns with broader industry data. Gartner’s 2025 forecast predicts that global spending on information security and risk management will rise by over 15 percent next year, driven by the growing importance of identity and data protection. For founders entering cybersecurity, experience and proven trustworthiness have become strategic assets that attract both customers and investors.

 Balancing Stealth Operations and Founder Visibility

 One of the most revealing ideas in the Real Life Superpowers episode is how founders in stealth mode must balance privacy with personal branding. Barishev argues that the company’s early credibility often depends on the founder’s own reputation. Building trust through public visibility, even without revealing product details, helps shape confidence among potential partners, clients, and investors.

 At the same time, he stresses the importance of maintaining internal conviction. Many early founders depend too heavily on feedback from mentors and peers, which can lead to doubt when opinions clash. Over time, Barishev learned to rely more on his internal compass and to evaluate advice based on lived experience rather than external praise. This shift, he explains, was key to making clear and confident decisions during the uncertain early stages of building a startup.

 Identity and Trust: The Next Frontier in AI Security

 Barishev’s stealth venture centers on identity and trust in artificial intelligence, a space that has become one of the most active fronts in cybersecurity. Synthetic identities, deepfakes, and AI-generated fraud continue to rise worldwide, creating an urgent need for solutions that can verify authenticity in real time.

 The Entrust 2025 Identity Fraud Report found that AI-assisted fraud cases increased by more than 30 percent year over year. Meanwhile, Fortune Business Insights projects the global identity verification market to surpass $40 billion by 2030. Barishev’s work reflects these trends, focusing on building systems that can help organizations establish digital trust in environments increasingly shaped by generative AI.

 Controlled Chaos as a Framework for Resilience

 Barishev often refers to his approach as controlled chaos, a mindset built around exposing oneself to difficult or unpredictable situations to develop adaptability. This concept, he explains, can apply to every level of business and leadership. Learning to function effectively amid uncertainty is now one of the most valuable skills in modern cybersecurity.

 His journey also highlights the importance of co-founder relationships. Working with long-time colleague Janan Rosenberg, he places emphasis on collaboration and mutual respect as a foundation for innovation. Their partnership, formed years earlier at Sygnia, demonstrates how shared history and complementary strengths can fuel creative problem-solving in high-pressure environments.

 Redefining the Human Element in AI Cybersecurity

 The conversation between Yossi Barishev, Ronen Menipaz, and Noa Eshed captures the human side of cybersecurity. Behind the data and market forecasts lies a story about courage, trust, and learning to operate without guarantees. In an age dominated by automation and machine learning, Barishev’s philosophy reframes adaptability and conviction as the most vital tools for building technology that lasts.

 His belief in progress through uncertainty positions him as part of a new generation of cybersecurity leaders who see risk not as a barrier but as a catalyst for growth. The leap into deep water, he suggests, may be the most effective way to learn how to swim in the digital age.
