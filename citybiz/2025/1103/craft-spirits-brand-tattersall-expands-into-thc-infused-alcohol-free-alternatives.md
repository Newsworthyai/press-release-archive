# Craft Spirits Brand, Tattersall, Expands Into THC-Infused Alcohol-free Alternatives

Tattersall Distilling, an award-winning craft spirits maker, today announced the launch of Tattersall Functional Beverages (TFB), two hemp-derived, THC-infused, alcohol-free drinks crafted to help people uplift or unwind. Backed by more than a decade of distilling expertise, Tattersall brings the same precision and flavor that built its reputation in spirits to the functional beverage category. Each TFB blend combines fast-acting THC with complementary cannabinoids, adaptogens, and electrolytes for a clean, modern wellness experience that many are seeking.

 “Tattersall has always been about crafting high-quality drinks for any situation or mood,” said Jon Kreidler, co-founder of Tattersall Distilling. “Today, more people are looking for different options, including reducing or eliminating alcohol, but they still want something that feels adult, festive, and functional. That’s why now is the right time to expand our portfolio into alcohol alternatives, offering a better alternative to uplift or unwind.”

 The two flagship beverages debuting this fall are:

 * Uplift – A bright, citrus-forward blend crafted for engagement and social connection. Infused with cannabinoids (THC, CBD, and CBG), adaptogens (Rhodiola Rosea and Lion’s Mane), and electrolytes, and sweetened with organic agave and natural flavors, it promotes focus and a light, feel-good mood without the empty calories of alcohol.
* Unwind – A berry-forward mix designed for relaxation and calm. Infused with cannabinoids (THC, CBD, and CBN), adaptogens (Passionflower and Reishi Mushroom), and electrolytes, sweetened with organic agave and natural flavors, and colored with Pea Flower extract, it helps ease stress and prepare the body for restorative rest.

 Both formulas contain 10 calories per serving and feature straightforward dosing (1T = 2 mg THC). Both beverages utilize industry-leading nano-particle emulsion technology, for increased bioavailability, faster onset and more reliable results. The smaller particle size also eliminates the traditional milky appearance and bitter off-notes of traditional THC-infused beverages.

 “When developing Uplift and Unwind, we focused on how people actually want to feel: energized, connected, relaxed, or calm,” added Kreidler. “By combining cannabinoids like CBD and CBG/CBN with functional adaptogens, we’ve created formulas that are balanced, approachable, and delicious. The experience is more than just THC, it’s about a well-rounded, sophisticated alternative you can trust.”

 Tattersall produces TFB at its state-of-the-art facility in River Falls, Wisconsin, one of the most sustainable distilleries in North America, ensuring consistency, transparency, and quality from sourcing to bottling. All products are third-party tested for potency and purity.

 Uplift and Unwind are now available online and are shipping to states where hemp-derived THC products are legal. In-store retail distribution in select states will begin later in the month with additional locations rolling out in early 2026. Both products are offered in 750 ml bottles ($60) and 2 oz minis ($7), designed to be enjoyed over ice, topped with sparkling water or tonic, or mixed into zero-proof cocktails.
