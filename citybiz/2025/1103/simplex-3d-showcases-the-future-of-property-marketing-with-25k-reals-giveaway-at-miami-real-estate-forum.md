# Simplex 3D Showcases the Future of Property Marketing with $25K REALS Giveaway at Miami Real Estate Forum

As the real estate industry continues to shift toward immersive and data-driven marketing, developers and brokers are looking for tools that go beyond traditional presentations. This November, Simplex 3D is stepping up to demonstrate how interactive technology can transform real estate sales. Ahead of the Miami Real Estate Forum 2025, the company announced an exciting $25,000 REALS Digital Sales Experience Giveaway, offering one attendee a chance to experience firsthand how digital engagement is redefining buyer interaction.

 Redefining the Sales Experience

 The centerpiece of Simplex 3D’s showcase is REALS, a 3D digital sales platform that allows developers and brokers to present their projects in a fully interactive way. Rather than relying on static images or brochures, REALS brings entire developments to life. Buyers can virtually explore properties, view floor plans, and experience amenities such as pools, gyms, and rooftop lounges, all within a shareable digital environment that can be accessed from anywhere.

 Each REALS experience is designed to provide valuable insights for sales and marketing teams. Every click, view, and interaction is tracked in real time, allowing developers to understand what captures attention and how buyers engage. This combination of immersive visualization and measurable analytics makes REALS a powerful tool in today’s data-driven market.

 “The real estate market has become more competitive and more digital,” said Avi Aflalo, CEO of Simplex 3D. “Buyers expect to experience a property, not just see it. REALS gives developers the ability to tell their story in a way that’s interactive, personalized, and impactful.”

 How to Join the $25K REALS Giveaway

 Attendees at the Miami Real Estate Forum 2025 can visit Simplex 3D’s Booth #14 from November 5 to 6, 2025, to enter the giveaway. Participants will have the chance to create their own personalized “REAL,” a digital preview of the REALS experience, and receive a unique link to share. The entry with the highest engagement score by Tuesday, November 11 at 11:59 PM (ET) will win a fully branded REALS Digital Sales Experience valued at $25,000.

 The prize package includes a complete digital sales environment tailored to the winner’s project, featuring a 3D model, embedded marketing materials, an interactive brochure, and a real-time analytics dashboard to monitor buyer engagement.

 To qualify, participants must be actively marketing or selling pre-construction or newly built developments in North America, with a minimum of 25 and a maximum of 100 residential units. The winning REALS experience must be launched by December 31, 2026.

 Immersive Marketing as a Competitive Advantage

 The introduction of platforms like REALS comes at a crucial time for the industry. Buyers increasingly begin their property search online and expect more interactive experiences during their journey. According to recent data, listings that include high-quality digital content generate 403 percent more inquiries, while 53 percent of real estate traffic now originates from digital marketing efforts.

 For developers and brokers, these numbers underscore the importance of innovation. REALS provides an opportunity to move beyond conventional sales tools and embrace interactive storytelling that captures emotion and builds trust. The platform’s analytics feature also helps teams understand what elements resonate most, enabling them to refine their marketing strategies with precision.

 “We’re helping real estate professionals move from showing to engaging,” Aflalo added. “When buyers can walk through a space, interact with its features, and share that experience with others, it changes how they connect with the project. That’s what REALS is all about.”

 The Next Step in Real Estate Innovation

 The $25,000 REALS Giveaway is not just a promotion. It is a statement about where real estate marketing is heading. As the industry embraces digital transformation, immersive technology is emerging as the standard for how projects are presented, evaluated, and sold.

 Simplex 3D’s participation in the Miami Real Estate Forum highlights the growing influence of proptech in reshaping buyer engagement. By integrating visualization, analytics, and storytelling, REALS helps bridge the gap between imagination and investment.

 For developers and brokers attending the event, the giveaway offers more than a chance to win. It is an invitation to experience the power of immersive marketing firsthand. As the market continues to evolve, those who adopt interactive tools like REALS are not just keeping pace with change, they are leading it.
