# Meet The People and KD Global USA Announce Strategic Alliance to Simplify U.S. and Canadian Market Entry for European Businesses

Meet The People (MTP), the innovative alternative to the traditional advertising holding company model with European DNA, and KD Global USA, an import company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, have announced a strategic partnership designed to help small and mid-sized European companies establish their business in North America — faster, leaner, and with minimal risk.

 The collaboration combines import management, logistics, fulfillment, distribution, and FDA/insurance support with creative, e-commerce, and growth marketing into one integrated 360° solution, creating a low-hassle entry gate for European entrepreneurs taking their first steps into the U.S. and Canadian markets.

 A 360° Market Entry Ecosystem for European SMEs

 European companies can rely on a complete and efficient market-entry framework, covering everything from import and compliance to creative, e-commerce, and demand generation.

 KD Global USA (Import & Operations) provides:

 * Import management as the primary import company partner (U.S. inbound)
* Warehousing, logistics, fulfillment, and distribution across the U.S.
* FDA support and insurance (compliance & risk coverage)
* Delivery and returns management for operational reliability

 Meet The People (Marketing & E-commerce) brings a U.S.-based e-commerce expert team to enable the first steps in online sales, from strategy to execution, including

 * Creation of all needed creative assets for product pages, ads, and content
* E-commerce setup and advertising/promotion strategy on Amazon, Walmart, and other platforms
* Performance-driven growth programs to accelerate visibility and sales

 Together, MTP and KD Global USA provide a high-value, low-risk solution for European SMEs to enter North America with maximum impact and minimal complexity.

 A Lean and Efficient Alternative to Large Network Agencies

 While large international networks prioritize high-budget global accounts, MTP × KD Global USA offers a lean, senior-led, and cost-efficient alternative tailored to smaller and mid-sized businesses. Founded by Europeans, MTP’s European DNA ensures cultural alignment, trusted guidance, and transatlantic capabilities that entrepreneurs typically find only in big networks—without the big-network overhead.

 Leadership Perspectives

 “This alliance gives European entrepreneurs an actionable and realistic way to start selling and growing in North America,” said Tim Ringel, Founder & CEO of Meet The People. “Our team sets up the creative, marketing, and e-commerce foundation, while KD Global – starting with import – delivers the operational reliability to make it work. It’s a 360° growth model built for agile, ambitious European SMEs.”

 “We’re excited to partner with Meet The People to make U.S. expansion more accessible,” said Patrick Koehler, Managing Director of KD Global USA. “As the import company of record, we simplify inbound logistics first – then add warehousing, fulfillment, distribution, FDA support, and insurance – so European brands can operate confidently while MTP drives demand.”
