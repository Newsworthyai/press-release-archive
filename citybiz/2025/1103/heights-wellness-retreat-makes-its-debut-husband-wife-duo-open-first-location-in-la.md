# Heights Wellness Retreat Makes Its Debut; Husband-Wife Duo Open First Location in LA

Porter Ranch residents will soon have a new destination for holistic wellness. Heights Wellness Retreat, a spa and wellness franchise offering both traditional and touchless therapies, will open its first Porter Ranch location on November 14. Located at 19765 Rinaldi Street, Suite A, the retreat will feature massage therapy, facials, Cryotherapy, Lymphatic Drainage Suit, Halo Salt Therapy, and other services designed to help clients nurture their body, mind, and spirit.

 To celebrate the new location, Heights Wellness Retreat Porter Ranch will host a grand opening ceremony on November 14 from 10:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. The event will feature live music, tours of the space, and a ribbon-cutting ceremony with government officials, including LA County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath, LA Councilmember John Lee, Congressman Brad Sherman, and Congressman George Whitesides. Also in attendance will be Heights Wellness Retreat CEO Shane Evans and COO Russell Hoff.

 The new Porter Ranch location is owned by husband-and-wife team Jacob and Ashley Bustos, marking the first-ever Heights Wellness Retreat to open across the U.S. This will also be the Bustos’s first of three retreats planned in the region. Together, they bring more than 40 years of combined franchise experience, primarily in the QSR food sector.

 Jacob’s entrepreneurial journey began as a teenager when he became a McDonald’s manager before turning 18 and later held leadership roles in nationally recognized fast-casual brands. Ashley began her career in hospitality at the House of Blues in San Diego and has since managed operations, recruitment, and marketing for several food brands.

 After recently going through their own wellness journey, the Bustos began exploring business opportunities they were passionate about and that would benefit their community. The more they learned about the wellness services Heights Wellness Retreat offers, the more they recognized the importance of overall well-being and the need for a location in Porter Ranch.

 “For us, this new location is more than just a business. It’s an opportunity to educate people on how they can prioritize their health and wellness. We’re not salespeople, we’re educators,” said Ashley. “When we began our own wellness journey, we realized how important it is to focus on health. We wanted to bring a Heights Wellness Retreat to our community to provide a new option for holistic wellness and help others achieve balance in their lives.”

 Heights Wellness Retreat of Porter Ranch will provide a range of touchless therapies, including Lymphatic Drainage Suit, Meditation, Cryotherapy, and Halo sSalt Therapy, giving clients a convenient way to achieve holistic wellness. These tailored treatments help guests restore balance and recharge both body and mind.
