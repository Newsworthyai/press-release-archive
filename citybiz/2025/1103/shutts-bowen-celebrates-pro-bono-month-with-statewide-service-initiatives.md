# Shutts &amp; Bowen Celebrates Pro Bono Month with Statewide Service Initiatives

In recognition of Pro Bono Month, Shutts & Bowen LLP planned and engaged in multiple community service events across its Florida offices.

 Throughout October, the firm’s attorneys and staff demonstrated their commitment to serving the community through pro bono initiatives and volunteer events designed to make a difference across the state.

 From food drives and school partnerships to legal education and advocacy, Shutts employees united in service to those in need. The firm’s Pro Bono Committee, co-chaired by Ella Shenhav and Michael Gore, coordinated efforts that reflected Shutts’ longstanding culture of giving back.

 “Pro Bono Month reminds us that every act of service, whether through our legal skills or through community outreach, has the power to transform lives,” said Ella Shenhav, Co-Chair of the Shutts & Bowen Pro Bono Committee. “I am truly proud of how our offices came together this month to give their time, resources and compassion to support Floridians in need.”
