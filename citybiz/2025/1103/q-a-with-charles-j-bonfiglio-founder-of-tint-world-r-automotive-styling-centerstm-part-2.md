# Q&amp;A with Charles J. Bonfiglio, Founder of Tint World® Automotive Styling Centers™ (Part 2)

Charles Bonfiglio, Founder and CEO of Tint World, the world’s leading automotive styling and window tinting franchise. Charles has redefined success in the automotive space, not through convention, but by combining grit, innovation, and decades of hands-on experience. From helping a major automotive brand modernize its point-of-sale system to scaling Tint World into a global franchise with over 150 locations, Charles consistently sees opportunity where others see limits.

 A lifelong entrepreneur, Charles launched a clothing factory right out of high school, scaled a Meineke operation to 10 locations, and became one of the first to implement custom computer systems in auto shops—later adopted by the franchise. His marketing instincts, tech-savvy mindset, and operational expertise made him a go-to resource for franchise leadership.

 After years of building systems that transformed how auto shops operated, Charles set his sights on the aftermarket accessory space. He acquired Tint World and built the franchise model from scratch, proving once again that vision backed by hustle can drive industry-wide innovation.

 What inspired the original vision for Tint World, and how has that core mission evolved since the brand’s founding in 1982? Additionally, how have your services offered evolved since 1982?

 Tint World® was founded in 1982 with a mission to deliver top-tier window tinting services, beginning in Tamarac, Florida. Driven by a passion for cars and a commitment to excellence, the brand quickly expanded its offerings to include tinting for vehicles, boats, homes, offices, and commercial buildings. As demand grew, so did new locations across South Florida. When I first encountered Tint World®, I saw more than just a window tinting business, I saw a brand with untapped potential and a legacy waiting to be expanded. The company had been around since 1982, founded on a passion for cars and a commitment to delivering top-tier window tinting services. It started in Tamarac, Florida, and quickly grew to serve not just vehicles, but also homes, offices, and commercial buildings. The concept was solid, the reputation strong, and the opportunity clear.

 In 2006, after years of experience with a global auto repair franchise, I was ready to build something of my own; something that could revolutionize the automotive aftermarket industry. I believed Tint World® had the perfect foundation to become a world-class franchise system. So, I acquired the brand and established Tint World®, LLC, setting up our corporate headquarters and training center in Boca Raton, Florida. From there, we began transforming Tint World® into a scalable, high-performance franchise model.

 Today, I’m proud to say that Tint World® has grown into the largest and fastest-growing automotive styling and window tinting franchise in the U.S., with over 150 locations open or in development and a goal of reaching 600 across North America. Our Automotive Styling Centers offer everything from protective films and vehicle wraps to audio systems, wheels, detailing, and ceramic coatings. Our Mobile Services division brings high-quality residential and commercial window film solutions directly to customers’ doors.

 Tint World Wilmington owner Robert Harman and his crew are gearing up to dive into a new project; the installation of protective window tinting on the Frying Pan Tower, a decommissioned Coast Guard light station located 30 miles off the coast of North Carolina. How do your franchisees find these projects?

 Robert found this opportunity through a repeat automotive customer. Because of the connection that he and the Wilmington team built with their great customer service, the owner of the FPT wanted to specifically bring them in to assist on this project due to his familiarity and trust with the Wilmington team.

 Are there any other standout or unique projects from this year that you can share?

 Alex and Myriam Guerrero (owners of Tint World El Paso TX) have always been about giving back to their local community and with their Tint World location they are able to do just that through a program called PROWD (Partners for Reentry Opportunities in Workforce Development).

 A few months ago, Alex and Myriam were intrigued by the idea of being a host company with PROWD, an organization aimed at helping individuals reenter the workforce after incarceration. Knowing that they have the platform to help others, Alex and Myriam felt this was only a natural step in helping those in their community. Alex and Myriam continue to utilize their Tint World platform as a means to help others within their community, and we look forward to seeing them continue to be pillars of the El Paso community.

 How have changing consumer preferences in car upfitting, detailing and overall customizations shaped your Product development?

 Offering more protective services. We see that people are keeping cars longer, and therefore wanting to customize and protect this purchase to ensure the investment value is there. Overall, automotive customization is experiencing unprecedented growth, evolving far beyond aesthetics as drivers increasingly prioritize protection, performance, and personalization.

 Tint World® is at the forefront of this transformation, recognized as the fastest-growing automotive accessories and window tinting franchise in the U.S. and a key player shaping the future of the $560 billion aftermarket industry. We are seeing that for many, these upgrades are no longer optional; they’re essential investments in safety, sustainability, and long-term vehicle value.

 How will you balance the need for local market autonomy with maintaining Tint World’s brand identity and standards?

 We encourage owners to get involved within their local communities to build their local presence and brand. Knowing that they have the backing of a strong brand name with a reputation for strong brand identity, quality work and customer service creates confidence and lays the path for great community partnerships.

 What emerging markets, neighborhoods or demographics represent the greatest expansion opportunity for Tint World?

 Looking ahead, Tint World® is targeting expansion in key growth markets including Texas, Minnesota to Massachusetts. These areas represent strong opportunities for the brand to meet increasing consumer demand for automotive styling and protection services, while also offering attractive prospects for new franchise owners. Each new opening is an exciting milestone for our brand and expanding into New Mexico is pivotal as we continue to grow across America. We are confident and proud of all our existing and new franchisees who are showcasing every day why we continue to be the best at what we do.

 Are there any exciting partnerships in the works or ready to announce?

 This year, we announced a strategic investment from Susquehanna Growth Equity (“SGE”), an entrepreneur-centric growth equity firm. This investment marks Tint World’s first institutional capital, which will be used to enhance operational support, accelerate franchise development, and further solidify the brand’s leading position in the automotive aftermarket industry. “SGE’s deep operational expertise in both the automotive and franchise services industries combined with their long-term mindset makes them the ideal partner to help Tint World accelerate and scale franchise expansion globally, while continuing to deliver exceptional value to our franchisees and customers. For over 4 decades, we have evolved into the premier automotive styling brand of choice for consumers, and SGE’s investment is a powerful endorsement of our franchisee-first approach.”

 We also partnered with Oracle Lighting, a leading provider of quality, innovative lighting solutions. Through this preferred collaboration, franchisees will gain streamlined access to over 25 years of design and development expertise, allowing consistency across the system. Our franchisees represent Tint World in their local markets, so giving them direct access to premium products and proven expertise is essential. This collaboration with Oracle Lighting delivers a reliable, system-wide solution for advanced automotive lighting. This partnership ensures that we can offer cutting-edge upgrades that enhance the customer experience while building stronger product offerings across every community we serve.
