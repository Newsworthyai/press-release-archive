The Moxie Award announced 17 deserving DC area businesses and organizations as 2025 winners Thursday night at the ninth Moxie Award Ceremony & Dinner, a celebration of Boldness in Business.

This year has identified another set of companies leading their industries, with our 2025 winners showing some of the strongest moxie we’ve seen yet,” said Moxie Award Co-Chair Sarah Cody.

 “After careful review and evaluation by a panel of third-party judges, this year’s 17 winners shined brightest among their competition for demonstrating exemplary resilience, innovation and growth, industry leadership, community service, and local achievements,” added Moxie Award Co-Chair Sara Roa.
