# Bob Ross Painting Fetches $47,500 at Alex Cooper Auctioneers

An oil painting by the late artist Bob Ross titled “Lake with Cabin and Trees” fetched $47,500 at auction on October 31, 2025, at Alex Cooper Auctioneers in Towson, Maryland. The 1987 work—a serene depiction of a wooded lakeshore and rustic cabin—was distinguished by its double signature and a handwritten dedication on the back from Ross to the couple to whom he originally gifted it.

 The result adds to a growing wave of collector interest in Ross’s paintings, which for years were rarely seen at auction despite his immense popularity as the host of PBS’s The Joy of Painting. Ross estimated that he created some 30,000 works during his career, yet only a small fraction have appeared on the open market. Until recently, most sold in the $10,000 to $30,000 range.

 In 2025, that dynamic shifted. Two Ross paintings offered at Bonhams in August achieved $114,800 and $95,750, respectively—setting record highs and signaling new strength in his secondary market. The $47,500 sale in Maryland, which surpassed its presale estimate of $20,000–$30,000, reflects that upward trajectory.

 Collectors cite several factors driving demand: the scarcity of authenticated works, their connection to Ross’s television legacy, and the emotional appeal of his nature scenes. The Towson painting’s personal inscription further elevated its value, offering a tangible link between the artist and the original recipients.

 Although Ross’s style once sat outside the mainstream art market, his cultural influence and the limited availability of his paintings have made them increasingly desirable to both nostalgic fans and fine-art buyers. With few new pieces likely to surface, each auction appearance now carries greater weight—and higher prices.

 Industry observers expect continued growth as collectors recognize the rarity of Ross originals. For now, “Lake with Cabin and Trees” stands as a reminder that the gentle painter who encouraged millions to find their “happy little trees” has quietly become one of the more intriguing stories in the contemporary art market.
