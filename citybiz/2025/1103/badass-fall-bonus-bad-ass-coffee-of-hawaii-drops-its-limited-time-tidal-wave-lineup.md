* Badass fall bonus features fan-favorite Dirty Pumpkin Chai alongside new lava-topped creation
* Available October 28 – December 1, 2025, at participating U.S. locations
* Cozy meets bold in this short-run flavor wave that crashes into fall

 Following the announcement of its “Maple, Spice & Everything Nice Badass” fall LTO lineup, Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii surprises fans with another bold burst of flavor – introducing its “Tidal Wave” collection: a bonus short-run seasonal lineup that delivers the cozy comfort of fall with an unexpected, badass twist.

 Cold foam is having a moment, and Bad Ass Coffee is riding the wave. Pumpkin continues to reign as a seasonal favorite, but layered textures like lava cold foam are giving fall drinks a whole new edge.

 Badass Fall Bonus

 Available October 28 through December 1 at participating U.S. locations while supplies last, the lineup includes:

 * Dirty Pumpkin Chai: Back by popular demand, this bold blend combines spiced chai, creamy pumpkin, and a shot of espresso for a drink that’s cozy, energizing, and anything but basic. Served hot or iced. Medium drinks are priced at $6.95.
* Iced Dirty Pumpkin Chai Lava: A bold new twist on the classic Dirty Pumpkin Chai. This decadent version is topped with rich, velvety cold foam and finished with a dusting of cinnamon, adding a smooth, foamy texture that takes this seasonal favorite to the next level. Medium drinks are priced at $6.95.

 “Dropping a Tidal Wave lineup mid-season is both a flavor move and a strategic one,” said Iain Douglas, Chief Brand Officer at Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii. “It keeps the menu fresh, gives fans something new to crave, and ensures our guests have a chance to continue fulfilling their pumpkin craving, the badass way.”
