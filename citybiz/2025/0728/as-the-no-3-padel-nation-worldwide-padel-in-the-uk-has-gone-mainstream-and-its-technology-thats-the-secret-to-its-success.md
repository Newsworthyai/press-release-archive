# As the No.3 Padel Nation Worldwide, Padel in the UK Has Gone Mainstream and It’s Technology That’s the Secret to Its Success

Five years ago, if you asked someone in London or Manchester what “padel” was, you might’ve received a puzzled look. No longer, however. Today, you’ll likely hear stories about competitive weekly matches, social leagues, the friend who introduced them to their new favourite sport, or the business (or romantic) match-making that the sport is stimulating. In just 36 months, the UK has exploded onto the global padel scene—leapfrogging over 50 established nations to become the world’s third largest padel market. This isn’t just a passing trend; it’s a cultural shift. And it is technology that’s the silent force accelerating this unprecedented sporting and cultural phenomenon––the likes of which Britain hasn’t seen in modern times.

 At Playtomic, we’ve had the privilege of being at the heart of this growth. As the world’s largest community of racquet sport players and clubs with over four million players across 6,000+ partner clubs worldwide, we’ve seen padel become more than just a game—it’s become a lifestyle and the most positive addiction of our times. In the UK, that transformation is happening in real time, and we’re proud to be the platform enabling it by match-making players through Open Play (the biggest pain point of padel is you need to “find your four”), facilitating court bookings, events, clinics, classes and more.

 “Today, 85% of UK padel clubs run their operations through Playtomic. Eight out of every 10 UK padel players use our app to book courts, connect with partners and track their game.”

 Let’s start with the numbers. Today, 85% of UK padel clubs run their operations through Playtomic. Eight out of every 10 UK padel players use our app to book courts, connect with partners and track their game. We’re not just a booking tool—I’m proud to say that (perhaps unlike any other sport) we’re the port of call that virtually every padel player passes on their journey to getting on court. We are, put simply, creating the UK’s padel community––its movement.

 This rapid growth isn’t by accident. Padel is an inherently social sport. It’s easy to pick up, fast-paced, and designed for connection. It brings people together—colleagues, families, friend groups—regardless of skill level. But for any sport to scale, it needs a strong foundation. That’s where tech, and more specifically, Playtomic, comes in.

 We’ve built a technology ecosystem that does more than just simplify logistics. Our platform helps players find games that match their level, discover new clubs, and foster communities around their passion. We’ve eliminated friction—booking a game is as seamless as ordering a coffee. And that simplicity fuels participation. Players stay engaged. Clubs operate more efficiently. And the sport continues to thrive.

 It’s not just about convenience—it’s about creating community. As padel’s popularity has surged, we’ve seen Playtomic become a connector. Whether you’re a seasoned player in Birmingham or a curious first-timer in Brighton, the Playtomic app is almost always your first stop in a sport that, otherwise, would be admin-heavy and a cue for needing your very own PA to manage your padel-playing schedule!

 This network effect is driving real-world impact. Today, 15 of the world’s top 40 performing padel clubs are in the UK—a remarkable feat when you consider where the country stood just a few short years ago. These clubs aren’t just thriving because of demand—they’re thriving because the infrastructure supports it. Playtomic gives clubs access to real-time data, streamlined bookings and engaged communities, helping them grow smarter and faster.

 “Our mission is to continue fueling that movement, giving players the best experience possible and helping clubs unlock their full potential––all at a time when padel has officially gone mainstream in the UK.”

 We see the UK as a model for what’s possible in padel globally. It’s a country that has a rich racquet sports heritage, and with our technology and the sport of padel, we’re witnessing the intersection of where lifestyle meets innovation—a place where people are embracing new ways to be active, connect and compete. Our mission is to continue fueling that movement, giving players the best experience possible and helping clubs unlock their full potential––all at a time when padel has officially gone mainstream in the UK.

 Of course, growth invites competition. And that’s a good thing. It keeps us sharp and focused on what matters most: delivering value to players and clubs. But the numbers don’t lie—Playtomic remains the UK’s trusted home for padel with almost nine in 10 players across the UK choosing Playtomic. We’ve earned that position by investing deeply in the player experience and listening to the community at every turn––and by never standing still.

 “Padel is more than a sport. It’s a cultural force—and the UK is leading the charge.”

 Looking ahead, we’re doubling down. We’ll continue building new features to help players track their progress, find better matches and stay engaged. We’re working with clubs to make operations even more efficient. And we’re exploring new ways to bring the spirit of padel to even more people—from schools to workplaces to neighbourhoods where courts are just starting to appear.

 Padel is more than a sport. It’s a cultural force—and the UK is leading the charge. At Playtomic, we’re honoured to be the platform that powers this movement. And we’re just getting started.
