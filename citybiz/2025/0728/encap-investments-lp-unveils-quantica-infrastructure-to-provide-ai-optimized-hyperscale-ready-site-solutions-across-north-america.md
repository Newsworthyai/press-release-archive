# EnCap Investments LP Unveils Quantica Infrastructure to Provide AI-Optimized, Hyperscale-Ready Site Solutions Across North America

Quantica Infrastructure, has officially launched, serving the need for integrated digital infrastructure solutions to accelerate data center development. Quantica delivers shovel-ready sites where customers benefit from a seamless integration of renewable energy, traditional grid power, and robust network connectivity—minimizing risk and simplifying deployment. Quantica believes that its holistic approach to data center development, alongside its focus on maximizing community and environmental benefits, provides a compelling value proposition for large data center clients.

 Quantica is backed by the Energy Transition arm of EnCap Investments LP (EnCap), a leading provider of growth capital to independent energy companies that has raised approximately $47 billion in private capital since its inception in 1988. Quantica has partnered with EnCap to solve critical infrastructure challenges for the digital economy. Nationwide, the shortage of ready-to-build sites is driving investment toward new markets to meet unprecedented demand. The Quantica model accelerates site selection, lowers risk, and speeds project delivery.

 “Hyperscale and AI growth are demanding better solutions for power, land, and network connectivity,” says John Chesser, CEO and founder of Quantica Infrastructure. “Quantica unlocks new opportunities by delivering shovel-ready, network-ready sites with dedicated renewable energy and resilient power supplies, so our customers can focus on innovation, not infrastructure logistics.”

 Quantica’s leadership team brings deep experience in power, network, and data center development, having developed and operated over 15 GW of energy projects, built major campuses in 22 states for global tech companies, and constructed extensive regional and international networks.

 “Quantica’s platform is the solution needed to break through current barriers to AI and digital infrastructure expansion,” said Jim Hughes, Managing Partner of EnCap. “Quantica’s unique platform offers us the opportunity to deploy capital in all aspects of the digital infrastructure economy – renewable power generation, real estate, and network. We are excited about the company’s existing project pipeline as it rapidly scales with the tailwinds pushing the digital economy.”
