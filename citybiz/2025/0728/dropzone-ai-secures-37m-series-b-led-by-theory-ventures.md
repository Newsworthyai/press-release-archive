# Dropzone AI Secures $37M Series B Led by Theory Ventures

Dropzone AI, the leading provider of AI SOC analysts, has raised $37 million in Series B funding, led by Theory Ventures and joined by Madrona, Decibel Ventures, Pioneer Square Labs, and IQT. This infusion of funding validates Dropzone AI’s unique solution as it leads the market for AI SOC agents, delivering measurable and transformative security outcomes for clients like UiPath, Zapier, Pipe, Assala Energy, and over 100 other enterprises. Their AI-native approach equips security teams with a superior defense – reducing security risks, operational costs, and analyst burnout – uniquely addressing the limitations of legacy cybersecurity solutions.

 “Dropzone AI’s ability to autonomously triage and investigate security alerts with human-level reasoning is a game-changer in a market that’s overwhelmed by alert fatigue and attack frequency,” said Vivek Ramaswami, Partner at Madrona Ventures. “At Madrona we look for founders who are passionate about advancing their sector and have the technical ability to do so; Edward exemplifies this pairing of vision and acumen. We’re proud to support him and the Dropzone team in building what modern security teams need to stay ahead.”

 According to the 2024 ISC2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study, 67% of respondents face staffing shortages, worsened by layoffs and budget cuts, making it more difficult to secure their organizations and driving interest in AI SOC solutions as leaders recognize the need for fundamental change. Recent Gartner® research predicts that, “multiagent AI in threat detection and incident response will rise from 5% to 70% of AI implementations to primarily augment — not replace — staff.” Additionally, we were recently named a Sample Vendor for AI SOC Agents within the 2025 Gartner® Hype Cycle for Security Operations. Dropzone AI is at the forefront of this transformative shift in cybersecurity strategies and investments, set to fundamentally redefine cybersecurity operations.

 “Dropzone AI SOC analyst’s performance is exceptional, delivering detailed, high-fidelity alerts within minutes,” said Andrew Marsh, Director of Information Security at the Indiana Farm Bureau Insurance. “This transparent, rapid processing and accuracy significantly elevates threat response capabilities.”

 Dropzone AI autonomously investigates security alerts, replicating the techniques of elite analysts and allowing SOCs to achieve coverage and speed that was not previously possible. CBTS, a North American IT services provider, uses Dropzone AI to enhance the efficiency and quality of its managed detection and response service. By offloading 30–50% of alert volume, the platform has significantly reduced repetitive work, allowing the team to focus more on threat hunting, customer onboarding, and improving coverage.

 “Today’s funding fortifies our market lead,” said Edward Wu, Founder and CEO of Dropzone AI. “We’re driving a generational shift in cybersecurity from manpower-bound, alert-chasing SOC teams to SOC teams backed by an army of autonomous AI agents that get to focus on what truly matters. This change is not optional; it’s essential. We exist to level the playing field for cyber defenders, and we can field these next-generation capabilities right now. We know who we’re working for. We’ll ensure they always outmatch the attackers.”

 The capital will be deployed across three strategic pillars. First, Dropzone AI will amplify its global footprint to meet surging demands by growing sales, marketing, and customer-success teams, so more security teams can better protect and enable their businesses without large increases in headcount or budget. Second, the company will fast-track the creation of additional specialized, autonomous AI agents for manual security tasks. Finally, it will deepen and extend its roster of ecosystem partnerships and technical integrations, ensuring its solutions can work with security teams of all sizes, tool stacks, and maturity to boost operational efficiency, sharpen threat detection, and drive stronger ROI.

 “As the AI SOC market has begun to mature, Dropzone has pulled ahead of the pack,” said Tomasz Tunguz, General Partner at Theory. “Their AI SOC analysts have been validated by some of the world’s largest enterprises and MSSPs, and are in production across dozens of businesses – along with recognition from analyst firms like Gartner and Forrester. Dropzone’s sales have taken off as they’ve established their position as a trusted category leader; we were excited to double down in the Series B to further accelerate their efforts and shape what’s next in AI-native security platforms.”
