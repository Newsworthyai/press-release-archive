Alkira, the leader in Network Infrastructure as a Service (NIaaS), today announced that CRN®, a brand of The Channel Company, has named Doug Houghton, Director of Channels, to its prestigious 2025 Top 100 Executives list. This annual ranking highlights passionate and outstanding leaders in the technology industry who are committed to driving IT channel growth through ongoing innovation and strategic, channel-focused initiatives.

 Houghton has been instrumental in steering Alkira through a period of record-breaking growth as demand for AI-ready networking infrastructure accelerates. Under his leadership, Alkira achieved a 255% year-over-year increase in channel annual contract value and doubled its revenue from fiscal year 2024 to 2025. The company’s 100% partner-led model has resulted in 72% of new logos being sourced through the channel, with over 60% of Alkira’s 130 global partners actively contributing to new opportunities. His strategic focus on global expansion – opening new markets in Canada, China, and Australia – has positioned Alkira as a leader in agile networking solutions for enterprises worldwide.

 The CRN 2025 Top 100 Executives list honors the achievements of executives across four categories: the 25 Most Influential Executives, Top 25 Channel Sales Leaders, Top 25 Innovators and Top 25 Channel Disrupters. These visionary leaders leverage their distinct strengths to propel the channel forward and shape the industry’s direction.
