# Moore: FEMA Denial Of Aid To Western Maryland Is Petty, Partisan And Punishing

A decision to deny federal emergency aid to areas of Western Maryland hit hard by flooding in May is being called petty, partisan and punishing by Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D).

 State, federal and local officials met for 90 minutes inside a Westernport restaurant Sunday to discuss last week’s denial by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the next steps they can take.

 And while there is bipartisan agreement that the denial is a “gut punch” to the area, and that there must be an appeal, there is disagreement on the motivations behind the decision.

 Sen. Mike McKay (R-Western Maryland) said that while the reason for the rejection is not yet clear, he does not believe it was political. But Gov. Wes Moore blamed the denial squarely on President Donald Trump (R).

 “His decision was a political decision,” Moore told reporters gathered under an awning next to the Port West restaurant Sunday. “There’s no other justification that could make where West Virginia had around the same amount of damage that was done” and had its application approved, while Maryland was rejected.

 The comments to reporters are some of the strongest yet made by Moore as he continues to decry a denial of federal aid by the Trump administration.

 Moore, McKay, Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-6th) and Westernport Mayor Judy Hamilton met at Port West Restaurant, which was hit hard by flooding that overwhelmed the town’s Main Street area in May. But on Sunday, it was reopepned and doing brisk business.
