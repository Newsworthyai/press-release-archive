# Q&amp;A with Matthew Kinsella, Chief Executive Officer of Infleqtion

Matthew Kinsella is the Chief Executive Officer of Infleqtion.

 Before joining Infleqtion, Kinsella was Managing Director at Maverick Ventures, a venture capital fund focused on early and growth-stage investments. During his tenure, which spanned nearly two decades, he partnered with many world-class entrepreneurs and had several successful exits. Matt loves helping scale high growth companies.

 He was the first investor in Infleqtion in 2018 and has been on the board ever since. He joined the company full time as CEO in April, 2024.

 Could you tell us about Infleqtion? How do you fit into the quantum ecosystem?

 Infleqtion is a global leader in neutral atom-based quantum technology, which we believe is the most adaptable, flexible, and scalable way to build quantum sensors and computers.

 We use the principles of quantum physics to build sensors and clocks that are in the field today for our customers, which include governments, enterprises, and research institutions. At the same time, we are using what we’ve learned from this near-term work to build quantum computers, and we’re highly competitive in the race to achieve quantum advantage.

 That’s a big deal—until now, humans have perceived the world using the laws of humanity through a computer’s binary approximation of how the world exists. Quantum uses the laws of physics to measure the world as it actually exists. Infleqtion translates quantum technology into solutions that expand human potential.

 Infleqtion recently announced that it was pursuing a business combination that would take the company public? Why is now the right moment?

 Going public unlocks a lot of opportunities for us. Once public, we expect to accelerate our technology and product roadmap, expand applications to new end markets, and scale customer adoption and ecosystem partnerships.

 When I think about what Infleqtion is trying to accomplish, coupled with the near-term opportunities in our quantum sensing products and the real demand from customers, this was the right path for us that will allow us to scale and deliver.

 We explored our options for going public and in the process met a great SPAC partner, Churchill Capital Corp X. They share our vision and our views on neutral atoms as a modality, and going public through a business combination was one of the fastest routes to the public markets for us. The timing is everything, because quantum is at an inflection point right now and we believe we are in a position of strength.

 As we move from successful pilots towards full-scale production for our leading customers, this partnership with Churchill provides us with additional capital and strategic expertise required to accelerate commercialization, expand our market leadership, and meet the rapidly growing demand for quantum solutions across a number of sectors, including AI, national security, and space.

 What modality does Infleqtion play in, and what are your use cases?

 Neutral atoms are nature’s ideal qubits. As a first mover in neutral atom technology, a leading quantum modality recognized for scalability, flexibility, and cost efficiency, Infleqtion is building a commercial platform that is practical, differentiated, and positioned to scale.

 Quantum is seen as the world of the very small and the world of the very cold. We are unique among our peers since our technology operates at room temperature versus needing bulky cryogenics. This achievement is key to what makes our technology scalable and useful for solving some of the world’s hardest problems and allows us to address a broader problem set than just computing. We are designing our technology to reduce size and cost to broaden field deployment.

 Our product portfolio includes quantum computers, quantum clocks, RF receivers, and inertial sensors, all optimized with Infleqtion’s proprietary software. These solutions are supporting initiatives at the U.S. Department of War, NASA, and the government of the United Kingdom.

 What is the timeline to quantum computing in your mind? What’s next for Quantum?

 The basic premise of our business and those of our peers is this: the world is not governed by 0’s and 1’s the way conventional computers are. It’s governed by quantum mechanics. When we say “quantum” we mean bringing the logic of physics that governs the world to computing and sensing.

 It means we can measure and compute the world around us and all of its features—like gravity and time—with more precision than we ever have before, which will change our ability to compute, navigate, and communicate.

 We’re not talking about the distant future—our neutral atom technology has already achieved quantum advantage in precision sensing and is progressing to advantage in computing with its record-setting logical qubits. We build sensors and clocks today with orders of magnitude better precision than classical standards, that will enable the military and allies to navigate in GPS-denied environments.

 What is your relationship with NVIDIA?

 Infleqtion collaborates with NVIDIA to accelerate the convergence of quantum and classical computing for today and for the future. Just as GPUs once augmented CPUs to unlock AI, quantum processors (QPUs) are emerging to complement CPUs and GPUs, opening entirely new markets and capabilities.

 Working together on the CUDA-Q platform, we’re demonstrating how QPUs can be integrated into GPU-accelerated systems. In materials science, for example, we partnered with NVIDIA to deliver the first logical qubit–powered application, using CUDA-Q and Infleqtion’s hardware and software to achieve a ~6× boost in accuracy.

 In finance, we combined our Q-CHOP algorithms with CUDA-Q acceleration, achieving up to 42× speedups over CPU-only methods, a powerful proof point for what hybrid quantum-classical workflows can deliver.

 Beyond these early wins, our collaboration is about the future: expanding the effective “context window” for GPUs, overcoming scaling bottlenecks, and building the foundation for fully integrated quantum-classical computing. By working with NVIDIA, we are preparing the ecosystem for the moment when large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum systems become widely deployed.

 You just announced some new architecture that will accelerate Infleqtion’s Quantum Computing Roadmap. Can you speak to what that means for the company?

 The keys to the kingdom in quantum computing are what are called logical qubits. Logical qubits are the building blocks for fault tolerant quantum computing. Where physical qubits are prone to errors, logical qubits are a reliable unit of quantum information. We generally consider that about 100 logical qubits will be a tipping point to outperform classical computers on targeted problems.

 Infleqtion has now already demonstrated 12 logical qubits with error detection and loss correction, positioning us ahead of schedule and ahead of many of our peers. Our previous target was achieving 10 logical qubits with error correction in 2026. Accordingly, we have updated our roadmap to now target 30 logical qubits in 2026 and 1,000 logical qubits by 2030. With our new architecture and updated roadmap, we’re accelerating innovation and execution toward fault tolerant quantum computing.

 This represents a major milestone for Infleqtion and for the broader quantum ecosystem. Infleqtion is proving that neutral atoms can deliver a scalable, commercially practical path forward and we’re building the systems that we anticipate will make quantum useful for solving real-world problems by the end of this decade.
