# Americans See Promise in Robotics, But Few Expect Their Own Jobs to Change, According to Pittsburgh Robotics Network Report

The Pittsburgh Robotics Network today released its 2025 AI & Robotics Sentiment Survey, revealing how Americans view the fast-changing role of robotics and AI in society. The results show a nation both hopeful and cautious: while many expect robotics to boost U.S. manufacturing and improve quality of life, only 12% believe their own jobs will be displaced by AI.

 Overall, respondents are nearly evenly split on whether robotics and AI will be a net positive or negative, but optimism stands out in several areas. A strong plurality (44%) expects more manufacturing to return to the United States, and nearly two-thirds (62%) say they are more likely to use robotics created in the U.S. Respondents are most excited about robotics helping in hazardous environments, responding to natural disasters, and advancing space exploration

 “This survey shows that Americans see the benefits of robotics but don’t always connect them to their own careers,” said Jennifer Apicella, Executive Director, Pittsburgh Robotics Network. “That’s a tremendous opportunity. If industry and training partners work together, we can close this perception gap with clear upskilling pathways and a confident workforce that embraces the technology.”

 “Pittsburgh and Allegheny County are building a model for inclusive growth in advanced manufacturing and robotics, and the insights from this report are critical to that mission. By expanding apprenticeships, short-cycle training, and career navigation, we are ensuring residents are ready for the quality jobs this sector is creating.” said Lauren Connelly, Director, Allegheny County Economic Development.

 Key Findings * Balanced Outlook: Americans are divided on whether robotics and AI will have a positive or negative impact, but nearly half see robotics as a positive for future jobs.‍
* Personal vs. General Risk: While “job loss” ranks among top public concerns for AI, only 12% believe their own job is at risk. This perception may not align with economic and industry forecasts, raising concerns that individuals could underestimate the need for reskilling and adaptation.‍
* Economic Views: A majority (53%) believe robotics could put downward pressure on household income, but those with higher education and income levels are more likely to expect benefits.‍
* Pro-U.S. Manufacturing: 44% expect more manufacturing to be conducted in the U.S., and 62% prefer robotics made domestically.‍
* Excitement and Apprehension About Use Cases: Respondents are most encouraged by robotics applications in disaster response, hazardous environments, and space exploration, though concerns remain around uses such as self-driving cars, military, and law enforcement.

 Methodology The 2025 AI & Robotics Sentiment Survey was conducted in March 2025 by the Pittsburgh Robotics Network. The study included nationally representative online surveys of 642 American adults on robotics and 669 on AI, plus state-level surveys in Pennsylvania. The margin of error is +/- 4% nationally and +/- 8% in Pennsylvania, at the 95% confidence level. Full methodology is available upon request.

 About the Pittsburgh Robotics Network The Pittsburgh Robotics Network is a nonprofit organization dedicated to driving the growth and commercialization of Pittsburgh’s world-leading robotics ecosystem. With over 150 robotics & AI companies in the regional cluster, the Pittsburgh Robotics Network connects businesses, research institutions, investors, and industry leaders to accelerate the transition of breakthrough robotics technology from the lab to the marketplace.
