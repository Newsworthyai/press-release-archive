# FLoatarama Awards $150,000 in Grants Through Nonprofit’s LGBTQ Youth Fund

12 South Florida LGBTQ Youth-Serving Organizations to Receive Vital Financial Support

 FLoatarama announced it will award $150,000 in grants through the nonprofit’s FLoatarama LGBTQ Youth Fund at a celebratory awards party on Thursday, October 23 at 6 p.m. at Hunters Wilton Manors.

 These grants, which fund life-changing, and sometimes life-saving programs, will be distributed among 12 extraordinary nonprofit organizations that provide critical support services for the one-in-five youth who identify as LGBTQ in South Florida.

 

 The evening will be hosted by Alex Miranda, FLoatarama’s 2025 Grand Marshal and beloved Deco Drive personality, and will celebrate philanthropy and unity within the LGBTQ+ community. With the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino as presenting partner, the anticipated 250 attendees can expect a lively night of entertainment, including dazzling performances from the Hard Rock Dancers and the incredible TP Lords.

 FLoatarama is an all-volunteer nonprofit dedicated to uplifting LGBTQ+ Youth in South Florida. Akin to a social club that puts the fun in fundraising, FLoatarama engages the community through a series of vibrant events, including its signature Pride-on-Water celebration each June during Pride Month and annual donations from its Founder’s Club members.

 

 By combining philanthropy with celebration, with its mantra of #HaveFunDoGood, FLoatarama not only raises vital funds for LGBTQ+ Youth but also enhances Greater Fort Lauderdale’s reputation as a safe, welcoming, and dynamic LGBTQ destination.

 “At a moment when federal and state funding for inclusive initiatives has been drastically reduced, many vital organizations in South Florida are facing unprecedented challenges. That’s why FLoatarama’s LGBTQ Youth Fund matters now more than ever. By investing $150,000 directly in local nonprofits, we’re helping sustain programs that support LGBTQ youth amid an environment of shrinking government resources,” said Scott Schramm, President of FLoatarama.

 1. Alliance for LGBTQ Youth, Mental Health, Education & Leadership
2. Big Brothers Big Sisters of Broward County, BIG Pride Mentorship & Life Coaching

 Since its founding five years ago, FLoatarama has awarded grants of more than $400,000 through its LGBTQ Youth Fund, managed in partnership with The Our Fund Foundation.
