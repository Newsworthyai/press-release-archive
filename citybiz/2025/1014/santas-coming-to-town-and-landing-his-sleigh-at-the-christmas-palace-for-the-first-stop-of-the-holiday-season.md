# Santa’s Coming to Town and Landing His Sleigh at The Christmas Palace for the First Stop of the Holiday Season

Who/What:

 Santa made his list and checked it twice, and South Florida’s residents have made it on the nice list. Santa is coming to town, and his first stop is The Christmas Palace, South Florida’s holiday headquarters for all things merry and bright.

 To kick off the most wonderful time of the year, Santa is making his first stop of the holiday season with two afternoons of festive fun and merry surprises at The Christmas Palace. First at its Miami location on Saturday, Nov. 1, and then at its Fort Lauderdale location on Sunday, Nov. 2, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. each day.

 All the good little boys and girls will have the chance to meet Santa, capture sleigh-full selfies, share their holiday wishes, and drop their Christmas lists into Santa’s magical mailbox, where Rudolph himself will dash them straight to the North Pole.

 Guests can shop South Florida’s largest and most elegantly decorated Christmas store to discover dazzling décor and the season’s most enchanting holiday treasures.

 In the spirit of giving, visitors are encouraged to bring new, unwrapped toys for patients at Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital. Each toy donor will receive a $10 store coupon to use that day on any purchase.

 These gifts allow Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital to continue living out its mission, “the power of play promotes positive healing.” Toys are used to celebrate major milestones such as birthdays and last chemo treatments, reward children for their courage and cooperation, and bring comfort and imagination into their healing journeys.

 Since 1992, The Christmas Palace has been the leading retailer for premium holiday decor in South Florida. Each year, The Christmas Palace redesigns the entire store for the Christmas season. Its reputation for offering the largest and most tastefully decorated Christmas decor store in the region is unmatched. The Christmas Palace is committed to helping customers find joyful and memorable moments with their loved ones for festive gatherings throughout the year.

 The Christmas Palace offers realistic Christmas trees with the perfect height, shape, style, and lighting for any space. Every tree at The Christmas Palace is designed to inspire, each one thoughtfully decorated to reflect the beauty and imagination of the season. This year, themed trees are defining Christmas. The Christmas Palace’s decorated trees showcase all the top trends to spark ideas and offer endless inspiration for every taste and tradition. Magical 2025 themes include forest Christmas décor, pastel color schemes, classic traditional luxury, Polar Bear, holly tradition and the Opulence Collection.
