# A Deadly Tire Risk Most Teens/Parents Overlook, and the Father On A Mission to Help them Tread Wisely

There’s a silent threat putting drivers at risk every time they get behind the wheel—unsafe tires. National Teen Driver Safety Week is coming in October, and I’m reaching out with a segment idea on what every parent and young adult needs to know about the dangerously overlooked role of tires in car crashes.

 The National Transportation Safety Board reports that approximately 33,000 car crashes each year in the U.S. are directly linked to tire-related issues such as tread separation, blowouts, worn or bald tires and improper inflation. These preventable incidents contribute to over 700 lives being lost annually.

 After tragically losing his 19-year-old son,Jackson (pictured below) in a preventable tire-related crash, Georgia father Alex Bebiak created the Road Ready Foundation with a simple but powerful mission: educate teens and parents about basic tire safety and the importance of regular inspections.

 Alex’s story is heart-wrenching (video here with his family’s full story; please be advised that the content may be sensitive to some viewers), but his emotional message will empower your audience with practical solutions to keep this kind of tragedy from happening to their family.

 Additional key messages and visuals:

 * Based on what Alex is seeing at the high schools he visits, three out of 10 teenagers are driving on unsafe tires.
* Michelin says 43% of teens have never checked their tire tread depth, and 32% have never checked tire pressure.
* The Road Ready Foundation uses the three “I’s” as a guide to ensuring that tires are safe for travel: inspect the tread, inflate/check tire pressure, install properly and in a timely manner.
* The quarter test is a great visual and easy tool to determine if the tread is at a safe depth.
* Local media has taken an interest in the foundation. See the recent Atlanta Journal-Constitution story here. We also have many photos and statistics to share for b-roll.
