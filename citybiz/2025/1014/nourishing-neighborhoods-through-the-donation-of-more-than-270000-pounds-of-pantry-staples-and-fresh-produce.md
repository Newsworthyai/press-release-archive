 These free farmers market-style events are held in collaboration with community-based food rescue organizations.

 Whole Foods Market launched Nourishing Our Neighborhoods in September 2020 to expand the capacity and capability for community-based food rescue organizations to move food from where it’s available to where it’s needed most across the U.S., Canada and the UK. Organizations participate in Whole Foods Market’s Grocery Rescue Program – picking up food from stores weekly and redistributing it to feed neighbors fresh, high-quality food as quickly as possible.

 On the same date and time as the Mobile Pantry events, 83 “Stuff the Van” events will be held to benefit all current Whole Foods Market Nourishing Our Neighborhoods recipient organizations. Organizations will have their vans stuffed to the brim with donated products by Whole Foods Market team members. Products donated will help support community members and families who are experiencing food insecurity. Nourishing Our Neighborhoods recipient staff will be on site to help stuff the van and to collect the food.

 South Shore Food Bank received a Nourishing Our Neighborhoods van in 2022.

 Members of the media are encouraged to attend.
