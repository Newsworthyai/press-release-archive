# Play It Again Sports® Opens New Location in East Valley

Play It Again Sports®, the leading family sporting goods resale concept, recently opened a new location in Gilbert located at 3143 E Williams Field., STE 101. The brand provides athletes of every age a place to sell their quality used sports and fitness equipment including: football equipment, baseball gloves and bats, hockey gear, golf clubs, soccer gear, lacrosse equipment, treadmills, weights, and more.

 A favorite among families, the new Play It Again Sports® in Gilbert is open to buy, sell and trade quality used sports and fitness equipment. Play It Again Sports is part of Winmark – the Resale Company®, a unique national retail resale franchise that focuses on sustainability, small business formation and providing Resale for Everyone®.

 Meet the Local Owners

 The new Play It Again Sports is owned by husband-and-wife duo Dean and Katie Sanchez. Dean, a captain in the Golder Ranch Fire District, and Katie, a teacher at ASU Prep, wanted to build something meaningful together for their community. With five children between the ages of 10 and 14 who are active in sports, the couple resonated with Play It Again Sports’ mission to make athletics more affordable and accessible for local families.

 “We know how challenging it can be to keep up with sports equipment, especially when each child plays multiple sports,” said Katie. “It can get financially overwhelming, and our goal is to create a community hub where families know they can find quality gear without breaking the bank.”

 Play It Again Sports accepts new and quality used equipment from community members, allowing the gear to end up in someone else’s hands rather than a landfill.
