# Tesoro Club to Host SafeSpace’s Third Annual Amethyst Gala, Supporting Survivors of Domestic Violence

Premier golf club community returns as venue partner, with sponsorships from GHO Homes, Ecclestone Signature Homes, and Illustrated Properties

 Tesoro Club, the Treasure Coast’s premier golf club community, will host the Third Annual Amethyst Gala on Friday, October 17, 2025, beginning at 6 p.m. The signature fundraising event, held during Domestic Violence Awareness Month in the Grand Clubhouse Ballroom, will benefit SafeSpace, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization and the only state-certified domestic violence center.

 Since its founding, SafeSpace has provided more than 500,000 safe nights of shelter to over 40,000 victims and children on the Treasure Coast, created financial and personal safety plans for hundreds of survivors, offered legal counsel to more than 450 individuals, and served nearly 1,500 children through specialized programming.

 The event will include a cocktail reception sponsored by the Gabby Petito Foundation and GHO Homes, followed by a formal dinner, live music, dancing, and a live auction. All proceeds will support SafeSpace’s emergency shelters, outreach advocacy, and other essential services.

 Last year’s sponsors, including Tesoro Club, Toll Brothers, and WCI/Lennar, helped raise $150,000 to support SafeSpace’s emergency shelters, outreach advocacy, and other essential services for survivors. This year’s goal is to surpass that impact with $175,000. Individual tickets are $250, and sponsorship opportunities are still available. For more information, visit the event page.
