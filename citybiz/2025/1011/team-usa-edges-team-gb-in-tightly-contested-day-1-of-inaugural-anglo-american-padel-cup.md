# Team USA Edges Team GB in Tightly Contested Day 1 of Inaugural Anglo American Padel Cup

Friday sees the famous GB vs USA rivalry return with thrilling matches, national anthems, and a clash that’s far from over.

 The first-ever Anglo American Padel Cup is officially underway, and after a dramatic day of top-class play featuring Britain’s and America’s elite padel players, Team USA holds a narrow lead over Great Britain as the two nations battle for transatlantic supremacy.

 The tournament opened in strong fashion at Padel Hub North London, with an emotional Opening Ceremony that brought together players, partners, and spectators in celebration of the sport’s new chapter. National anthems were performed live by acclaimed operatic tenor Alexander Wall, while Emily Kilner, event host and MC, welcomed both teams to the stage. Remarks from co-founders Ben Nichols, Joelle Quinn, and Bill Ullman set the tone for the weekend, reflecting on 174 years of sporting rivalry between Britain and America, and the opportunity to add padel to that legacy in what felt like a seminal moment for the sport.

 Across both Open and Age Group divisions, Friday’s 10 matches delivered high-quality padel and no shortage of drama. Of the 40 points available on Day 1 (from a total of 96 across the tournament), many matches went the distance, with Team USA pulling ahead 24-16 at the conclusion of day one.

 Strong results for Team GB came in the Men’s Open, where Cameron Dollimore and Nick Hatchett delivered a commanding performance to defeat the American pair of Andrew Herring and Kevin Ye, 6–4, 6–2. But it was the Americans who clinched several of the day’s closest encounters, none more dramatic than the Women’s 50+ match, where Andi Neugarten and Sarah Levy of Team USA edged out their British opponents in a thrilling match tiebreak, winning 7–5, 4–6, (11–9).

 Britain’s Ellie Tait and Laura Jackson put in a strong showing in the Women’s Open Category, securing an important win for GB and building momentum ahead of Saturday’s deciding matches.

 Anglo American Cup Founders, Bill Ullman, Ben Nichols and Joelle Quinn said: “Day One showed exactly why this event was created and why it’s an event of its time – the Anglo American Cup delivered high-level competition, national pride, and matches that could have swung either way. ” said Bill Ullman, co-founder of the Anglo American Padel Cup.

 “What’s clear is that this famous historic rivalry has been reinvigorated through the world’s fastest-growing sport. With 50 of the 96 points still up for grabs tomorrow, it’s all to play for in what promises to be an incredible finale.”

 Team GB Women’s Open Captain, Ellie Tait said: “The team performed brilliantly today, and we’re proud of how we competed on Day 1 of the first-ever Anglo American Cup. The atmosphere and sense of pride were incredible, it was very cool to feel a long-standing rivalry reignited. We’ve also really enjoyed spending time with the U.S. players and sharing the love of the game that brought us all here. Tomorrow, it’s all to play for, and we’ll be giving everything to bring the trophy home.”

 Saturday will feature the remaining matches worth 56 points, including many mixed doubles and featured finals matches that will decide who takes home the inaugural Anglo American Padel Cup. Play begins at 10.00am, with the Closing Ceremony and Prize Giving set for 19:30.

 With the margins tight and the Cup still up for grabs, the stage is set for a dramatic finish.
