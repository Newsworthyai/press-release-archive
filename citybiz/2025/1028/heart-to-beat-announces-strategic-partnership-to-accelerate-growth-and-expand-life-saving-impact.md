# Heart To Beat Announces Strategic Partnership to Accelerate Growth and Expand Life-Saving Impact

Expanded ownership group strengthens operations, broadens reach, and reinforces the company’s mission to protect workplaces and communities.

 Heart To Beat, a leading life-safety partner to organizations nationwide, announced a strategic partnership with three business leaders — Mike Britton, John Ryan, and Dave Stefanski — who have joined Founder and CEO Scott Kuhlman as owners and operators of the business.

 Together, the leadership team plans to expand Heart To Beat’s reach to more organizations throughout the Mid-Atlantic and nationwide by strengthening its core safety management platform, accelerating organic growth, and pursuing acquisitions of complementary life-safety businesses.

 “This partnership is not a change in who we are. It’s an exciting step forward to get us to the next level,” said Scott Kuhlman. “With added expertise and resources, we’ll accelerate growth while maintaining the same values, leadership, and dedication to our customers.”

 Heart To Beat helps organizations prepare for and respond to emergencies through a comprehensive suite of life-safety solutions, including AED management, CPR/First Aid training, and workplace safety consulting.

 The company employs a growing team of certified professionals serving a blue-chip client base that includes Under Armour, Amtrak, the Washington Commanders, the University of Maryland, Albertsons, JLL, and Mission BBQ.

 Prior to founding Heart To Beat in 2016, Kuhlman served in a Baltimore-area fire department responding to critically ill and injured individuals, eventually rising to the rank of EMS Captain overseeing more than 50 EMS personnel. Drawing on that frontline experience, he built Heart To Beat into a company designed to teach people the skills that help them save lives at work and in their communities.

 The partnership combines Kuhlman’s deep industry expertise with Britton, Ryan, and Stefanski’s background in managing and scaling companies. The three founded Sisu Partners in 2024 to acquire and operate exceptional companies with strong fundamentals and meaningful missions. They found exactly that in Heart To Beat. Drawing on extensive experience in growth strategy, operations, and acquisitions, the partners will bring a hands-on approach to expand Heart To Beat’s mission.

 “We were drawn to Heart To Beat because of its people, culture, and mission,” said Mike Britton. “Scott has built a strong foundation and has an outstanding reputation in the industry. We’re eager to build on that success and further establish Heart To Beat as the premier safety partner for organizations across the country.”
