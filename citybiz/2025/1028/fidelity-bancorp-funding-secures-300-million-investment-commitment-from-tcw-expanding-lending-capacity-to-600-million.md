# Fidelity Bancorp Funding Secures $300 Million Investment Commitment from TCW, Expanding Lending Capacity to $600 Million

Fidelity Bancorp Funding (“FBF”), a leading private credit platform specializing in real estate bridge lending, announced it has secured an incremental investment commitment of $300 million from TCW, a leading investment firm managing over $200 billion of assets under management. The new capital increases FBF’s total lending capacity to $600 million, further strengthening its ability to serve private real estate investors amid tightening credit conditions.

 “This infusion of capital from TCW positions us to serve more borrowers while continuing to deliver strong, risk-adjusted returns to our investors,” said David Frosh, Chief Executive Officer of FBF. “As banks retreat, our selective bridge lending approach enables us to fill a critical financing gap and support high-quality real estate operators with speed and certainty.”

 “We’re proud of this capital commitment from TCW,” said Charlie Woo, President of Fidelity Bancorp Funding. “This new capital allows us to deepen our reach and capitalize on one of the most attractive market environments we’ve seen in decades.”

 “We are excited about our partnership with Fidelity Bancorp Funding – an investment that demonstrates TCW’s continued focus on sourcing high-quality private opportunities backed by real assets,” said Max Scherr, Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at TCW. “The company’s disciplined underwriting and deep expertise in real estate make them a compelling partner in today’s environment. This commitment reflects our confidence in their platform and alignment with our investment approach across the TCW ABF business.”

 The partnership underscores growing institutional demand for high-quality private credit strategies backed by real estate, as investors seek durable income opportunities in a shifting market environment.
