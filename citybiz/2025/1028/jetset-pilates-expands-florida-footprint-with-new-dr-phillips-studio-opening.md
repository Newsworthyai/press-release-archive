# JETSET Pilates Expands Florida Footprint with New Dr. Phillips Studio Opening

JETSET Pilates, the fast-growing modern Reformer Pilates franchise offering premium, full-body workouts, is proud to announce the upcoming opening of its newest Florida studio in Dr. Phillips. Located at 7940 Via Dellagio Way, Suite 112, the studio will officially open its doors in early November and celebrate with a grand opening celebration in early December, featuring vendors, giveaways, food, a live DJ, and access to discounted Founding Memberships, available for a limited time at $199 per month.

 The 2,100-square-foot studio is owned and operated by husband-and-wife team Austin and Vinitha Wolak, who also own the JETSET Pilates location in Winter Park and plan to open two additional studios in the Greater Orlando area. Vinitha, who grew up in Orlando, first discovered Pilates on her own and was hooked after her very first class. She loved the workout so much that she immediately began researching Pilates concepts with the dream of opening her own studio in the community she calls home. After exploring more than 15 different Pilates brands, she found JETSET to be unlike anything else on the market, with an unmatched workout experience and strong quality control across locations.

 “I have lived all over the Orlando area, and have deep family ties in the community,” said Vinitha. “Opening studios with JETSET Pilates allows me to bring something I’m deeply passionate about to the community that shaped me. From the moment I tried my first class, I knew Pilates was special, and JETSET stood out as the best experience I could share with others.”

 Austin, originally from Sarasota, was introduced to Pilates by Vinitha and quickly became a dedicated client himself, having always held a passion for fitness. With their shared backgrounds as quality engineers in the medical device and pharmaceutical industries, the couple saw JETSET’s model and high standards as the perfect fit for their next venture.

 “We’re excited to continue expanding JETSET in Orlando, especially with Austin and Vinitha,” said Tamara Galinsky, Founder and Brand President of JETSET Pilates. “With almost a year in business in Winter Park, they’ve received fantastic community reception, and we look forward to seeing their continued success in Dr. Phillips.”

 With Orlando ranking the healthiest city in Florida, the Wolaks see Dr. Philips as a natural next step for JETSET Pilates, noting that community-area social gatherings and events are often centered around health and wellness. JETSET Pilates Dr. Phillips will offer 50-minute, high-end classes on custom reformers that combine strength, cardio, and Pilates-inspired movements set to DJ-curated music. Each class is designed to strengthen, lengthen, and energize both body and mind, reflecting the studio’s mission to blend premium fitness with a community-driven experience for all levels.
