# Q&amp;A with Heidi Neville, Multi-Unit Owner at Prime IV Hydration &amp; Wellness

Heidi Neville is a multi-unit franchise owner and entrepreneur based in Utah, managing multiple Prime IV Hydration & Wellness locations across the state. Heidi is a longtime advocate for proactive health and holistic wellness and began franchising with Prime IV to help others take charge of their well-being.

 Together with her husband and children, she has built a thriving family-run business that continues her legacy of compassionate business ownership. Before launching her Prime IV locations, Heidi gained years of experience in corporate management and community outreach through a career in real estate, skills she now channels into developing motivated teams and memorable client experiences.

 Tell us a little about your background and what drew you to Prime IV Hydration & Wellness?

 I’ve always been passionate about helping people feel their best, physically, mentally, and emotionally. My background has always centered around leadership, business, and wellness, and I’ve loved finding ways to blend those worlds.

 When I met Amy Neary, the founder and CEO of Prime IV Hydration & Wellness, she had just one location, but I instantly connected with her energy and vision. The idea of giving people a way to recharge, heal, and thrive from the inside out through IV therapy completely resonated with me. It had all the components I believed a great brand needed, purpose, innovation, and genuine impact. I told Amy right then that if she ever franchised, I’d be her first franchisee.

 Six months later, in March 2020, as many businesses were closing their doors due to COVID. I opened the very first Prime IV franchise. That moment reinforced everything I believed about resilience, health, and leading with heart. Since then, I’ve been honored to help grow Prime IV into a brand that empowers others to feel better, live better, and take control of their wellness.

 What is Prime IV Hydration & Wellness for those who may not be familiar?

 Prime IV Hydration & Wellness is a luxury wellness spa that helps people look, feel, and perform better through the power of IV vitamin therapy.

 We specialize in customized IV drips and vitamin injections that deliver essential nutrients directly into the bloodstream for faster, more effective results than traditional supplements. Whether someone is looking to boost energy, strengthen immunity, improve recovery, support weight loss, or simply feel their best, Prime IV offers a science-backed, spa-like experience that meets them where they are.

 Every guest receives personalized care from a highly trained medical team in a relaxing environment designed for renewal and rejuvenation. It’s more than just hydration, it’s about helping people take control of their health and discover what “feeling better” truly feels like.

 You opened your first Prime IV Hydration & Wellness in Utah after a 20-year career in real estate. How did your background prepare you for this, and what did you have to learn along the way?

 After 20 years in real estate and construction, I knew how to build strong teams and lasting businesses, but Prime IV taught me how to build people. My background gave me the structure, systems, and vision to grow, but I had to learn the heart of wellness, how health, energy, and confidence can truly change lives. That’s what makes this work so rewarding.

 Prime IV continues to grow nationwide. What do you think makes the concept so appealing to entrepreneurs and consumers alike?

 Prime IV is appealing because it sits at the intersection of health, lifestyle, and innovation. For consumers, it delivers something everyone wants: more energy, stronger immunity, faster recovery, and better overall wellness, in a way that’s both science-backed and experience-driven. People love that they can feel a difference almost immediately.

 For entrepreneurs, Prime IV offers a proven model with purpose. It’s not just a business; it’s a movement focused on being proactive instead of reactive in health care. The brand combines strong systems, medical credibility, and a modern spa aesthetic that makes wellness approachable and exciting. It’s rare to find a concept that’s both deeply impactful and financially rewarding, and that’s what makes Prime IV so powerful.

 What have been the biggest challenges you’ve faced owning a business, and how have you worked through them?

 One of the biggest challenges I’ve faced as a business owner has been learning how to balance growth with leadership, building multiple locations, developing teams, and still keeping the culture strong.

 In the beginning, I tried to do everything myself, but I quickly realized that true success comes from empowering others and trusting strong systems. Hiring and developing the right people, putting clear processes in place, and creating a culture of accountability and connection has been key.

 Another challenge has been navigating external pressures like staffing shortages, supply issues, and the fast changing wellness industry. I’ve learned to stay adaptable, stay positive, and always come back to our mission, helping people feel better. When you lead with purpose and surround yourself with great people, you can overcome just about anything.

 You’ve spoken about wanting to create a legacy your children can be proud of. How does Prime IV Hydration & Wellness fit into that vision?

 Creating a legacy my children can be proud of has always been my “why.” I wanted to build something meaningful, not just a business, but a brand that truly helps people and can live on through my family.

 What makes Prime IV so special to me is that my three daughters are now Prime IV franchisees themselves. Watching them lead, inspire their teams, and carry forward the same mission of helping others feel better has been one of my proudest accomplishments.

 Prime IV isn’t just our family business, it’s our shared purpose. It represents strength, health, and service, and it’s something we’re building together that will impact lives for generations

 You’re part of a growing group of women franchise owners breaking into the wellness industry. What advice would you give to other women who want to take a similar leap?

 My advice to other women who want to take a leap into business or the wellness industry is simple: believe in yourself and start before you feel ready. You don’t need to have it all figured out to make an impact.

 Surround yourself with people who lift you higher, stay curious, and never stop learning. The wellness industry is built on connection, empathy, and empowerment all qualities women naturally bring to the table. There will be challenges, but confidence grows through action.

 Trust your instincts, stay rooted in your purpose, and remember that your voice and vision matter. When women step into leadership in wellness, we don’t just build businesses, we build movements that help others heal and thrive.
