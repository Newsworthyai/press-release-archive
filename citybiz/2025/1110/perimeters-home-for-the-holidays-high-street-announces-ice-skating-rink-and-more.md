 “This year, we’re making High Street Perimeter’s home for the holidays,” said Amari Holmes, Marketing Manager at High Street. “We’re transforming our newly opened town center into a winter wonderland for the community to gather and celebrate the season. Whether skating on our brand new ice rink, sipping on a holiday-themed cocktail, or snapping photos with Santa in our newly activated jewelbox space, we hope our guests will make unforgettable memories with us this holiday season at High Street.”
