# Dogtopia Foundation Celebrates Veterans Day with Nationwide Support for Veterans and Service Dogs

This Veterans Day, Dogtopia, the nation’s leading dog wellness franchise, and the Dogtopia Foundation are celebrating the continued impact of their mission to help veterans across the country regain independence, confidence and connection through the life-changing companionship of service dogs.

 Founded in 2017, the Dogtopia Foundation has expanded its reach alongside Dogtopia’s growth to more than 250 locations nationwide, united by a shared belief that dogs help our heroes.

 Reflecting on the Dogtopia Foundation’s Achievements

 Over the years, the Foundation has:

 * Raised more than $5 million to fund the training of service dogs for veterans in need
* Supported more than 700 veteran-service dog teams nationwide
* Partnered with leading organizations including America’s VetDogs, Canine Companions and K9s For Warriors
* Mobilized thousands of Dogtopia pet parents and franchisees through creative fundraising efforts such as Makin’ Bacon parties, bubble days and themed photo events

 “What began as a grassroots effort within a few Dogtopia daycares has evolved into a nationwide movement,” said Liz Meyers, Executive Director of the Dogtopia Foundation. “Every dollar raised, every dog trained and every veteran supported reflects the heart of our community. This Veterans Day, we’re proud to honor those who’ve served and the incredible dogs helping them heal.”

 “At Dogtopia, we believe dogs change lives, and nowhere is that more evident than in the bond between a veteran and their service dog,” said Neil Gill, CEO and President of Dogtopia. “This milestone is a reflection of our community’s compassion and commitment to honoring those who’ve served.”

 Honoring Veterans Nationwide

 To commemorate Veterans Day, Dogtopia daycare centers across the country are hosting special events to celebrate those who served and raise funds for veterans awaiting service dogs. Even the pups are joining the festivities, with playrooms decorated in patriotic themes and “thank you” messages visible to pet parents via Dogtopia’s live webcams.

 “Thank you to every member of the Dogtopia team for helping to bring Brady into my life,” said Jesse Heineken, a U.S. veteran and America’s VetDogs graduate. “When life feels like I’m walking a tightrope, Brady is my safety net. He takes me out of isolation, breaks the darkness, and brings light.”

 “America’s VetDogs was honored to be the first partner selected to work with the Dogtopia Foundation,” said John Miller, President and CEO of America’s VetDogs. “Since our partnership began, they’ve donated nearly $600,000, a remarkable testament to their unwavering commitment to those who have served and to the extraordinary impact of service dogs.”

 Advancing Research and Expanding Impact

 Beyond funding service dog training, the Dogtopia Foundation supports groundbreaking research led by Dr. Maggie O’Haire, associate dean for research at the University of Arizona College of Veterinary Medicine. Her studies highlight the measurable benefits of service dogs for veterans with PTSD, research that could help expand access and secure new support for more veterans in need of these life-changing companions.
