# Carl Angus DeSantis Foundation Presents Transformative Grant to Achievement Centers for Children &amp; Families’ Early Learning Program

Achievement Centers for Children & Families has received a generous grant of $365,000 from the Carl Angus DeSantis Foundation in support of its nationally accredited Early Learning Program (ELP). This investment represents a critical commitment to early childhood education and the well-being of underserved families in southern Palm Beach County.

 With this grant, the DeSantis Foundation is directly helping to sustain and strengthen one of the region’s most impactful early education initiatives. The ELP serves up to 109 children ages 1 to 5 at the Nancy K. Hurd campus in Delray Beach, delivering more than 2,485 service hours annually through a curriculum focused on six essential developmental domains, and providing over 47,000 meals annually. The program maintains low teacher-to-child ratios, employs 22 full-time, highly credentialed educators, and ensures children are kindergarten-ready, setting the foundation for lifelong academic and social success.

 “The Carl Angus DeSantis Foundation’s support lifts a tremendous burden from our organization, allowing Achievement Centers to continue delivering full-day, year-round care while expanding services that meet the evolving needs of our children and families,” said Stephanie Seibel, CEO of the Achievement Centers. “More than just funding, this gift enables our staff to focus on program innovation and long-term sustainability with ripple effects across our afterschool programs, teen initiatives, and family support services.”

 Each year, Achievement Centers serves more than 760 children and their families, primarily in Delray Beach, where many face systemic barriers such as poverty, trauma, and limited access to quality education. With an average household income of just $24,592, the ELP provides an essential lifeline, particularly to working single-parent households and children at risk of falling through the cracks.

 “The DeSantis Foundation’s gift is more than financial; it is a vote of confidence in our mission and in the future of our community’s youngest learners,” said Ms. Seibel. “On behalf of the children, families, and staff of Achievement Centers, we extend our deepest gratitude to the Carl Angus DeSantis Foundation for their partnership, trust, and belief in the transformative power of early education.”
