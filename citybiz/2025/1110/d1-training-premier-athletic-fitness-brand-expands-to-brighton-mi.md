# D1 Training, Premier Athletic Fitness Brand Expands to Brighton, MI.

D1 Training, a leading fitness enrichment concept utilizing the five core tenets of athletic-based training, will be opening a new location in Brighton at 8707 West Grand River Ave on November 17. The new group fitness facility employs a sports-science backed training regimen led by certified trainers to help people of all ages achieve their sport and fitness goals.

 In celebration of the new location’s launch, Brighton neighbors and residents are encouraged to stop by and meet the facility’s team at its grand opening on December 1. The location will also be hosting an official launch party, celebrating new members and offering prospective clients a final opportunity to lock in exclusive founding member rates on December 6.

 Owners Carl and Kristin Rispoli will join a roster of impressive existing franchisees, including professional athletes like Kylie Fitts and Jordan Gay. Additional D1 partners include NBA star Chris Paul and Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow.

 Brighton residents Carl and Kristin Rispoli are preparing to open the area’s first D1 Training facility, offering a results-driven fitness experience for youth and adults alike. As a commercial banker and local small business advocate, Carl was drawn to the supportive structure of franchising, while Kristin—an associate professor at Michigan State University, psychologist, and lifelong fitness enthusiast—was inspired by D1’s science-backed approach to training. With two active kids of their own and deep ties to the Brighton community, the Rispoli’s saw an opportunity to bring something new and impactful to the area’s thriving sports culture. The couple’s goal: to help all members reach their fitness potential in a welcoming and supportive environment.

 “From coaching my son’s travel baseball team to cheering on our many college and professional teams across Michigan, we know firsthand that Brighton is a town that lives and breathes sports, and we’re proud to bring a training facility that meets that energy head-on,” said Carl and Kristin “This isn’t just a gym — it’s a place where kids, teens, and adults can push their limits, train like athletes, and grow stronger together.”

 D1 Training offers four age-based programs including Rookie (ages 7-11), Developmental (ages 12-14), Prep (ages 15-18) and D1 Adult. Each fitness program is based on the five athletic-based tenets: dynamic warm-up, performance, strength program, core and conditioning, and cool down. Outside of group workouts, D1 Training offers group, semi-private, and one-on-one training with world-class coaches. The goal is simple: to continue to train athletes who are dedicated to their sport or fitness goals, regardless of age or athletic background.

 “Carl and Kristin are the ideal candidates to bring the D1 Training experience to Brighton,” said the brand’s Chief Operating Officer, Dan Murphy. “We’re thrilled to welcome them to the D1 family and are confident in their ability to show the Brighton area what they have been missing out on. D1 is a one-of-a-kind fitness experience that’s built around the individual and meant to help people meet their athletic goals. Our strong network of franchisees embodies our core values to bring the D1 Training vision to life, and we know Carl and Kristin will do just that in Brighton and its surrounding communities.”

 Strategically expanding across the nation through franchising, D1 Training has more than 100 performance centers open with over 100 additional locations in various stages of development. The brand is currently seeking financially qualified business builders, former athletes, and entrepreneurs, who share a passion for fitness and youth sports, who are ready to make a positive impact on their community.
