# Girl Scouts of Southeast Florida Honors 74 Young Changemakers at 2025 Silver Award Showcase

Girl Scouts of Southeast Florida celebrated the exceptional achievements of 74 Girl Scouts from across the region who earned the prestigious Silver Award during the 7th Annual Silver Award Showcase.

 The Silver Award is the highest honor a Girl Scout Cadette in grades six through eight can achieve, recognizing leadership, innovation and community impact. To earn the award, each Girl Scout identifies a local issue, develops a sustainable solution and dedicates time and creativity to making meaningful changes in their community.

 “These compassionate young leaders tackled complex issues with courage, determination and creativity that can spark real change,” said Lisa Johnson, CEO of Girl Scouts of Southeast Florida. “Their projects remind us all that girls are not waiting for the future, they are creating it.”

 This year’s Silver Award Class of 2025 collectively contributed 4,100 service hours through 35 projects in partnership with dozens of nonprofit organizations, schools, animal rescues, beaches and municipalities. Their efforts addressed a wide range of community needs, including mental health awareness, self-defense education, food insecurity, environmental sustainability, care for aging populations and honoring veterans.

 In 2024, in an unprecedented effort to amplify the voices of Florida girls, Girl Scouts of Southeast Florida unveiled the State of the Florida Girl Report, commissioned by the Girl Scouts of Florida Association, which was a groundbreaking assessment of the unique challenges facing girls across the state. The Florida Girl Report brings to light some startling realities about the circumstances impacting the daily wellbeing of girls in Florida. Girl Scouts of Southeast Florida provides programs tailored to the needs of today’s girls, offering a safe and supportive environment for every girl while addressing these specific issues effectively. The programming is designed to support girls at every stage of their journey, equipping them with opportunities and experiences they deserve to grow into successful, healthy, well-adjusted young women ready to lead life with confidence.
