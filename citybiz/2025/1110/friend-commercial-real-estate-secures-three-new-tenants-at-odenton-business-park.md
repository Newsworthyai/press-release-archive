# Friend Commercial Real Estate Secures Three New Tenants At Odenton Business Park

Friend Commercial Real Estate, a premier commercial real estate advisory and brokerage firm, is pleased to announce multiple new leases at the Odenton Business Park in Anne Arundel County.

 Yasmin Bannan of Friend Commercial Real Estate represented the landlord in securing leases with JC Audio and The Motorcycle Shop at 8270 Lokus Road, a flex / warehouse building located in the Odenton Business Park.

 Bannan, along with Todd Bailey of Friend Commercial Real Estate, represented the landlord and procured the tenant – Smash My Trash, a waste management company – at 8266 Lokus Road, a flex / warehouse building in the same business park.

 “These leases reflect the strength of the small-bay industrial and service market in central Maryland,” said Yasmin Bannan of Friend Commercial Real Estate. “Odenton Business Park has been especially active because it offers the combination of visibility, access, and professional management that tenants are looking for.”

 Approximately 3,000 square feet remains available for lease at each of 8266 and 8270 Lokus Road – with flexible layouts ideal for light industrial, service, or contractor uses.
