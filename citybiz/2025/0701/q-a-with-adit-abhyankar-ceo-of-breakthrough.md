# Q&amp;A with Adit Abhyankar, CEO of Breakthrough

Adit Abhyankar is CEO and Founder of Breakthrough. he has over 30 years of enterprise sales and SaaS experience. As the former CEO of Ad-Lib.io (acquired by Smartly) and Head of Google Marketing Platform EMEA, he has a proven track record of scaling businesses and driving growth.

 Tell us about the business, and your background?

 Breakthrough is an AI-powered self-learning sales platform designed for modern B2B teams. It embeds directly into live deals and sales workflows, using real-time buyer interactions and team behavior to help reps learn faster, sell smarter, and close more consistently.

 Unlike generic AI tools that automate surface-level tasks, Breakthrough focuses on strategic sales communication, not just writing better emails, but shaping the messaging, tactics, and behavior that move deals forward. The platform draws from real call data and pipeline dynamics to improve decision-making, objection handling, and alignment across sales, marketing, and product teams.

 The founding vision was simple: enable sales teams to learn from their best-performing reps and scale that success company-wide using AI that’s rooted in actual deal flow.

 How has the company evolved over the past years?

 Breakthrough was launched just over a year ago and has already made significant progress. What began as an exploration into whether AI could improve sales communication quickly turned into a production-ready platform, shaped by over 600 customer interviews and rapid iteration alongside early users.

 In that time, the team has raised $600,000 in pre-seed funding, partnered with startups and enterprise customers, including a Fortune 500 organization, and expanded the product’s capabilities well beyond content generation. The platform now adapts to different client sales methodologies, brand guidelines, existing workflows, and cross-functional alignment, with a focus on helping teams sell the way buyers actually buy.

 What can we hope to see for the future of the business?

 The focus going forward is on accelerating customer traction and deepening the product’s learning capabilities to move beyond productivity improvements to actual deal acceleration by systematically looking at how we can improve the impact of every sales communication touchpoint

 A major area of expansion is enabling dynamic collaboration between sales, marketing, and product. By feeding deal-level insights back into positioning, onboarding, and campaign design, Breakthrough is helping companies move beyond static messaging and toward a more adaptive, insight-driven go-to-market engine.

 What problems is Breakthrough solving that generic AI tools are missing?

 Most AI tools used in sales today are focused on efficiency – content generation, summarizing calls, automating outreach. But very few are built to help teams make smarter decisions, tailor messaging across stakeholder groups, or learn what truly drives momentum in a deal.

 The research shows that while 55% of teams use AI to create sales material, far fewer use it for strategic tasks like opportunity qualification or persona-specific messaging. The platform is purpose-built to fill that gap – analyzing live sales interactions to guide reps on where to focus, how to adapt messaging, and what tactics are likely to succeed, all based on real customer behavior.

 Why do you think sales teams are falling short in using AI to its full potential, and how does this affect ROI?

 Many teams jumped into AI with high hopes, but quickly hit limits. The research shows that 20% of users find generic tools just “adequate,” and common frustrations include hallucinations, privacy concerns, and the need for too many manual adjustments. Most tools aren’t tuned to a company’s market, ICP, or deal motion, so reps end up spending more time editing outputs than selling.

 This creates what Breakthrough calls the “AI implementation trap” where AI becomes another admin task rather than a strategic advantage. Sales teams need platforms that are context-aware, behaviorally driven, and tailored to how they actually sell. Without that, AI can’t deliver on its promise.

 Nearly half of sales professionals spend 30 to 60 minutes a day using AI, about the same time spent on CRM admin. That’s a clear sign that generic tools aren’t delivering material productivity gains beyond help writing content. In many cases, teams are simply shifting effort they spent on one tool to another, not actually reducing non-selling time.
