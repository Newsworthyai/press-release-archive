 Tell me what Aerwave does.

 Aerwave is a next-generation managed WiFi platform that transforms connectivity in multifamily communities. Using a 100% fiber network backbone and proprietary software, Aerwave delivers instant-on, gigabit-plus internet across entire properties. This enables seamless, secure, and always-on connectivity for residents, site teams, and owners, supporting everything from smart home devices to property operations.

 You are based in Dallas. Do you have clients all over the country, or are you focused on the Texas market?

 While Aerwave is headquartered in Dallas, the company serves clients nationwide. Since its 2019 launch, Aerwave has expanded to over 28 markets across the U.S., supporting more than 50,000 apartment homes and partnering with leading multifamily owners and operators, including 30% of NMHC Top 50 Owners and Managers.

 Internet connectivity and broadband are so common today that people don’t even think about it. What is the critical problem that you solve?

 The critical problem Aerwave solves is the complexity, inconsistency, and inefficiency of traditional broadband in multifamily buildings. Residents often face fragmented networks, dead zones, and complicated setup processes. Aerwave’s unified, property-wide network infrastructure provides seamless, private, and secure WiFi everywhere on the property—eliminating the need for individual routers and ensuring a move-in ready, always-on experience.

 Why is broadband access so important in the multifamily space? And what are the barriers to making it universal?

 Broadband is now considered a fundamental utility in multifamily housing—residents expect immediate, reliable, and high-speed internet as soon as they move in. It’s essential for work, education, entertainment, and smart home technology, and is a top factor in leasing decisions.

 Barriers to universal access include outdated building infrastructure, high upgrade costs, regulatory complexities, and affordability challenges—especially in older or subsidized properties where ISPs may not see a strong return on investment.

 Why aren’t the major national broadband companies doing what you’re doing?

 Major ISPs typically focus on traditional, unit-by-unit service models and may not invest in the infrastructure upgrades needed for seamless, property-wide connectivity—especially in older or lower-income buildings. Their business models often don’t prioritize the unique needs of multifamily owners and residents, nor do they provide the instant-on, managed WiFi experience that Aerwave delivers.

 What makes Aerwave different than other ISPs?

 Aerwave stands out through its owner- and operator-focused approach, proprietary technology, white glove customer service, and whole-property managed WiFi platform. Key differentiators include:

 Instant-on, gigabit-plus connectivity throughout the entire property

 Private, secure networks for each resident—no need for personal routers

 Seamless mobility: residents stay connected anywhere on the property

 Smart home enablement supports IoT devices and property tech

 Superior 24/7 domestic customer support from multifamily industry experts

 Value for owners: increases net operating income and streamlines operations

 What do you see as the future of broadband in the residential rental market?

 The future of broadband in residential rentals is seamless, property-wide connectivity that’s as reliable and essential as electricity or water. Residents will expect instant, secure access everywhere—from their unit to amenities—along with support for smart home devices and evolving digital lifestyles. Managed WiFi platforms like Aerwave are poised to become the standard, enabling owners to differentiate their properties, drive value, and meet the rising expectations of renters in a digital-first world.
