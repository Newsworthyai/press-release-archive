 TWO YEARS LATER, JUST WHERE IS THE RED LINE HEADING? Two years after Gov. Wes Moore revived the Red Line, Baltimore’s proposed east-west light rail feels mired in uncertainty. In June 2023, Moore reversed former Gov. Larry Hogan’s 2015 decision to cancel the roughly 14-mile transit project. Then, a year ago, Moore rejected bus rapid transit in favor of light rail for the line stretching from Woodlawn to Bayview, vowing to “walk every step of the way” with the community until trains were running. The next project milestone was expected to have been announced by the end of 2024. Daniel Zawodny/The Baltimore Banner.

 HOUSEHOLDS WILL HAVE TO WAIT A BIT LONGER FOR ENERGY REBATES: Maryland households will have to wait just a little bit longer for a promised rebate on their energy bills amid the summer heat. While legislative leaders had said they expected the first payments in July, the Maryland Public Service Commission said Friday that the first round of rebates to all residential energy customers is expected in August or September. A second round is anticipated in either January or February. Total payments are expected to average about $80 per household for the year. Christine Condon/Maryland Matters.

 * The rebates are part of the $200 million that state legislators earmarked in the Next Generation Energy Act, which passed in the 2025 General Assembly and was signed by Gov. Wes Moore on May 20. The law went into effect June 1. Bria Overs/The Baltimore Banner.

Maria Sacchetti/The Washington Post.

 COLUMN: THEIR NAMES WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN: The names float in and out of my consciousness, carried on a wind of remorse. Gerald. Rob. John. Rebecca. Wendi. My friends, murdered seven years ago in the Capital Gazette newsroom shooting, find me where they do every morning, shortly after I wake and remember to be grateful that I’m alive. I have my wife, my kids, my work to live for, and most days I do. Rick Hutzell/The Baltimore Banner.

 UNION HEADS ASKED TO PULL SUPPORT FOR MO CO SHERIFF: Montgomery County Sheriff Maxwell Uy may soon be facing at least one opponent in the 2026 gubernatorial election following a call this week by one of the county’s largest workers unions for local leaders to withdraw their support for him, alleging he has cultivated a “hostile” work environment.

 HE SAVED THE STATE’s BIG TREE PROGRAM: John Bennett is Maryland’s real-life Lorax. Like the Dr. Seuss character, he speaks for the trees. And he’s done so since 2007, when he saved the state’s Big Tree Program from shutting down under budget cuts. He’s keeping alive a tradition of documenting the state’s largest trees that is now 100 years old. The irony is that big trees aren’t necessarily that big. Anna Rubenstein/The Baltimore Banner.

 B’MORE TECH HUB HOPES TO NAVIGATE TRUMP ERA AND WIN 70 MILLION BUCKS: When Baltimore won a spot on the federal government’s Regional Technology and Innovation Hubs list in 2023, it felt like millions of dollars for economic development were within reach. But, two funding opportunities later, Baltimore hasn’t been chosen — and now the region must adjust its pitch for a Trump administration with far different priorities than the previous one. Bria Overs/The Baltimore Banner.
