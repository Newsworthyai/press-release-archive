# Serotonin Centers Debuts First Connecticut Location

Serotonin Anti-Aging Centers (Serotonin), the fast-growing anti-aging and longevity franchise, has opened its first Connecticut location in Stamford. Located in the High Ridge Shopping Center at 1121 High Ridge Rd., residents will be able to explore a variety of innovative treatments designed to support health, vitality, and overall well-being.

 Serotonin Anti-Aging Centers are lauded for their concierge-style health optimization and anti-aging services including:

 * Medical weight loss
* Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
* Sexual Wellness
* Body contouring (CoolSculpting/EmSculpt Neo)
* Medical aesthetics (Botox, Fillers, Microneedling with PRP, and Hydrafacials)

 The new Serotonin in Stamford is locally owned by Chris Rotondi. Rotondi’s professional career began with Shift4, a startup transaction processing company. At the time, the company was still in its early stages and Rotondi was hired as its 13th employee. Today, the company has grown to over 3,000 employees and is a publicly traded company. After 21 years with the company, Rotondi sought to expand his horizons. With a lifelong interest in health and wellness and a desire to own a business, he explored franchise opportunities and quickly connected with Serotonin and its innovative offerings.

 “I’ve always been passionate about health and wellness, and as I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized how essential it is to take a proactive approach to your health” said Rotondi. “When exploring business opportunities, I knew I wanted to own something I truly believed in—something that could make a positive impact on the community. Serotonin embodies that vision perfectly.”

 Each center staffs licensed medical practitioners and personal health coaches that work one-on-one with each member to design personalized prescriptive health plans. This empowers clients to take control of their health needs and work directly with their provider. Services focus on four main modalities – hormone restoration, aesthetic enhancement, weight control, and immunity – to help optimize the health and happiness of members, who are guided along by Serotonin’s team of experts at every juncture of their unique health journey.

 Aiming to rapidly expand into new markets across the U.S., Serotonin Centers is positioned to lead the Medspa and anti-aging industries as demand in the sector continues to flourish. The opening of the brand’s new location in Stamford marks the next step in the brand’s continued expansion.
