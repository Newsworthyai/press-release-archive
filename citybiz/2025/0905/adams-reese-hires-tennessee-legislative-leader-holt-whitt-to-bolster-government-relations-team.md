# Adams &amp; Reese Hires Tennessee Legislative Leader Holt Whitt to Bolster Government Relations Team

Adams & Reese is pleased to announce that Holt Whitt has joined the AmLaw 200 firm’s Nashville office as a Government Relations Advisor within the Intersection of Business & Government (IBG) Practice Group. Holt brings over 15 years of experience in state government, including most recently as the Assistant Commissioner for Legislative Affairs for the Tennessee Department of Health.

 Holt joins an Adams & Reese Government Relations team that includes more than 75 attorneys and advisors across the nation, and one that boasts former state legislative leadership, former members of Congress, former economic development officials, and a former U.S. Ambassador. The team represents clients at the federal, state, and local levels of government through advocacy, lobbying, support, and legal counsel.

 “Holt is a home run hire for our Government Relations Team in Tennessee,” said Brad Lampley, Adams & Reese IBG Practice Group Leader and Partner in Nashville. “We pride ourselves on building a team with the best and brightest professionals who have strong reputations and relationships and can get things done. Holt has built a career as a long-trusted advisor, leader, and go-to resource in both the executive and legislative branches, and he will be an outstanding partner to our clients.”

 At the Tennessee Department of Health, Holt helped develop the department’s legislative agenda and worked with key members of the Tennessee General Assembly to ensure passage of Governor Lee’s health-related initiatives. His understanding of Tennessee’s healthcare infrastructure and industry is significant, especially as the state’s healthcare industry is experiencing significant growth, particularly in the Nashville area, which is becoming a major hub for healthcare innovation.

 “My time in Governor Lee’s administration and at the Tennessee Department of Health gave me the chance to work alongside truly remarkable colleagues to make a real difference for Tennesseans,” Holt says. “Now, joining Adams & Reese, I’m excited to help clients connect with state and local government, grow their businesses, and help drive economic growth all across Tennessee.”

 Earlier in his career, Holt served as Senior Policy Advisor at the Tennessee Department of Human Resources, leading legislative strategy and stakeholder engagement. He also held several senior leadership positions in the Tennessee General Assembly including Interim Chief of Staff and Director of Legislation for the Speaker of the House, and Director of Policy and Research and Analyst for the Tennessee General Assembly’s Republican Caucus.

 Through his various roles, Holt has served as liaison for negotiations, coordinated efforts to ensure bill passage, and assisted in evaluating legislation, among other responsibilities.

 Holt earned his Bachelor of Science degree in public relations from Virginia Commonwealth University.
