# State Roundup: Moore Signs Exec Order Fast-Tracking Housing Construction; Power Line Surveyors Denied U.S. Marshals Protection; Moore Says He’ll Take Federal Crime Help, But Not From National Guard

MOORE SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER FAST-TRACKING HOUSING CONSTRUCTION: Gov. Wes Moore swung for the fences Wednesday with a sprawling executive order that incentivizes building more homes across the state, an attempt to juice up his record on housing policy as he stares down the final General Assembly session of his first term. Hallie Miller/The Baltimore Banner.

 * The executive order aims to fast-track housing development to reduce the approximately 96,000-unit shortage Maryland currently faces. That shortage was driven by “insufficient housing construction over the last 15 years,” said the order, which said the lack of affordable housing options has created an “imminent threat of widespread social and economic disruption.” Danielle Brown/Maryland Matters.
* “When we talk about housing that’s affordable we’re not just talking about building a shelter, we’re talking about building a legacy,” said Moore. “If you want to create wealth, start with housing. If you want to create jobs, start with housing.” Tashi McQueen/The Afro.

 JUDGE DENIES POWER LINE SURVEYORS US MARSHALS PROTECTION: A judge ruled that surveyors for a controversial Maryland power line project will not be accompanied by U.S. Marshals while on landowners’ properties, according to the developer. PSEG Renewable Transmission requested federal protection after crews were allegedly threatened while attempting to access private land in Carroll County. Adam Thompson/WJZ-TV News.

 * “Given the limited resources of the U.S. Marshals Service, the Court concludes that the circumstances — at least at present — do not warrant sending U.S. Marshals to accompany PSEG and its agents,” the judge wrote in his order Tuesday. Christine Condon/Maryland Matters.

 MOORE WOULD TAKE FEDERAL CRIME HELP, BUT NOT FROM NATIONAL GUARD: Gov. Wes Moore (D) said Wednesday he would be willing to accept help from the federal government to fight crime in Baltimore, just not through the deployment of National Guard troops as President Donald Trump (R) has repeatedly threatened. Danielle Brown/Maryland Matters.

 MAYOR SCOTT URGES B’MORE RESIDENTS TO ‘STAND UP FOR CITY:’ With President Donald Trump likely to order federal forces into Baltimore, Mayor Brandon Scott on Wednesday urged residents to stand up for the city but keep their response measured to avoid fueling the president’s narrative. “We have to make sure that we … stand up for our city and our neighbors and our neighborhoods, but we cannot allow them to get what they want,” Scott said. Lee O. Sanderlin and Emily Opilo/The Baltimore Banner.

 * Dozens of people with signs protested the possibility of federal troops coming to Baltimore outside of City Hall on Wednesday. “I think the least we can do is show up and say that we do not need the National Guard in Baltimore,” said Maura Taylor, a Baltimore resident who attended the protest. Not everyone agrees. Tori Yorgey/WBAL-TV 11.

 EXPERTS QUESTION TRUMP’s USE OF TROOPS IN AMERICAN CITIES: Two national security scholars are saying that the Trump administration’s plans to deploy National Guard troops in Baltimore, Chicago and other U.S. cities – as well as its recent interventions in Los Angeles and Washington- signify an unprecedented expansion in domestic use of the military that could face resistance from the courts. Dan Belson/The Baltimore Sun.

 POLITICAL NOTES: HERSHEY CONSIDERS RUN FOR GOVERNOR: Add Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. to the list of Republicans kicking the tires on a run for governor. Hershey, who has a dozen years in the Maryland Senate, said in a radio interview Wednesday he is being encouraged to consider throwing his hat in the ring, following the entrance of Ed Hale Sr. “I think Maryland Republicans deserve better than to have lifelong Democrats switch jerseys at the last minute and try to claim our nomination,” Hershey said. Bryan Sears and William Ford/Maryland Matters.

 PROGRESSIVE GROUPS BACK JAWANDO FOR MO CO EXECUTIVE: Progressive Maryland and the Working Families Party, two progressive political organizations focused on workers in the area, are endorsing County Council Vice President Will Jawando in the 2026 county executive race, the groups announced Wednesday during a press conference in downtown Silver Spring. Ashlyn Campbell/Bethesda Today.

 SCOTT ADMIN SEEKS ANOTHER EXTENSION ON CONTROLLING SEWER OVERFLOWS: The Scott administration says Baltimore will need another 16 years to eliminate sanitary sewer overflows that for years have periodically polluted local waterways and introduced E. coli and other contaminants into the harbor and the Chesapeake Bay. The 2002 decree with the EPA, Maryland Department of the Environment and U.S. Department of Justice called for the end of untreated sewage releases from engineered pipes where wastewater can escape, by January 1, 2016. Mark Reutter/Baltimore Brew.

 B’MORE TO PAY STATE $3.3M IN DEBT OVER THREE SHUTTERED SCHOOLS: Baltimore will pay the state of Maryland more than $3.3 million to relieve itself of the financial burden caused by three permanently closed schools, according to last-minute property transfer agreements approved Wednesday by the city’s Board of Estimates. Carson Swick/The Baltimore Sun.

 AS ELECTRIC RATES RISE, CONSUMER ADVOCATES SEEK RELIEF: Consumer, low-income and environmental advocates want Maryland officials to hold the state grid operator accountable as ratepayers are poised to see higher bills from Baltimore Gas and Electric in September. The Maryland Office of the People’s Counsel estimates that average BGE customers will owe an additional $16 monthly. That’s on top of other estimates that show the average energy customer in Maryland is spending $1,000 more per year. Hannah Gaskill/The Baltimroe Sun.
