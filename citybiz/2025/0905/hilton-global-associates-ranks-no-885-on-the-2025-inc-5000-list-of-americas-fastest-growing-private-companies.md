# Hilton Global Associates Ranks No. 885 on the 2025 Inc. 5000 List of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies

NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Hilton Global Associates Inc., a leading provider of investigative due diligence and strategic research solutions, today announced its placement at No. 885 on the 2025 Inc. 5000, Inc.’s annual list of the fastest-growing private companies in America.

 The Inc. 5000 list is a prestigious editorial award that highlights the most successful and dynamic privately held companies in the United States. Businesses such as Microsoft, Meta, and Patagonia first gained national attention as Inc. 5000 honorees.

 “This recognition is a reflection of our team’s relentless pursuit of excellence and the trust our clients place in us,” said Melissa Kelley-Hilton, Founder and CEO of Hilton Global. “Sustained growth, especially in a complex global environment, is no small feat – and doing so while preserving our values and delivering exceptional quality is something I’m deeply proud of.

 “We’re grateful to our clients, our partners, and our team – your belief in our mission makes this possible,” added Kelley-Hilton. “We’re just getting started.”

 In an economic landscape marked by uncertainty, inflation, and ongoing disruption, the companies honored in this year’s Inc. 5000 list have demonstrated remarkable resilience. The 2025 top 500 companies achieved a median three-year revenue growth rate of 1,552%, collectively creating more than 48,678 jobs in the U.S. over the same period.

 “Making the Inc. 5000 is always a remarkable achievement, but earning a spot this year speaks volumes about a company’s tenacity and clarity of vision,” says Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “These businesses have thrived amid rising costs, shifting global dynamics, and constant change. They didn’t just weather the storm – they grew through it, and their stories are a powerful reminder that the entrepreneurial spirit is the engine of the U.S. economy.”
