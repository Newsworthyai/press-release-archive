 Can you give us an overview of your journey, and how you’ve combined your background in spirituality and entrepreneurship to impact so many lives?

 My journey began when I was just 15 years old in Los Angeles, when someone brought me to a Kabbalah seminar that completely changed my life. I remember the teacher telling me that all my dreams and goals – even becoming the most successful, powerful, or famous – paled in comparison to what I could achieve by aligning my soul with the light of the Creator. That moment set me on a 25-year path of studying and teaching this ancient wisdom.

 What’s unique about my approach is that I’ve never separated spirituality from practical life success. After spending over 20,000 hours personally coaching others and conducting thousands of live seminars, I’ve seen how Kabbalah provides spiritual technology… the actual mechanics of how energy works in our lives. It’s not about behavior modification or positive thinking; it’s about understanding the cause and effect system that governs our reality.

 The entrepreneurial aspect came naturally because Kabbalah teaches us that we’re meant to be vessels for infinite abundance. When you understand that the Creator wants to give you everything, business becomes a spiritual practice of receiving so you can share and create more light in the world.

 What sets your approach to teaching manifestation, consciousness, and personal transformation apart from other voices in the space?

 The key difference is that I always involve the Creator in everything. Most teachings focus on behavior modification – just think positive, just be grateful. But Kabbalah goes much deeper. It explains the mechanics of your soul and how energy interacts with your vessel.

 For example, instead of just saying “I deserve good things,” I teach people to say “The Creator desires for me to have infinite blessings, and I choose to open myself to them fully.” This isn’t spiritual woo-woo… it’s cause and effect in a perfect system.

 When you understand that what you see is just 1% of what’s really happening, and that there’s a whole spiritual system dictating everything in our lives, your spiritual actions become infinitely more powerful. The same act of kindness, the same smile you give someone – they’ll feel a hundred times more energy from it because you understand what it’s doing on a soul level.

 As more people explore spirituality and self-development, how do you see the role of teachers like yourself evolving in a world that’s increasingly focused on mindfulness, energy, and emotional intelligence?

 The role of authentic spiritual teachers becomes even more critical as the field expands. What I see happening is that people are hungry for real transformation, not just surface-level feel-good content. They want to understand the “why” behind life’s experiences and gain tools to navigate challenges with clarity and purpose.

 My role is to provide that deeper framework. Kabbalah transcends religions and beliefs – I’ve seen it transform even the most skeptical minds, including atheists. It’s not about changing what you believe; it’s about deepening your awareness and connecting the dots that already exist within you.

 As more people become interested in consciousness, teachers like myself need to bridge that ancient wisdom with modern life. We need to show people how to access their infinite soul while dealing with toxic relationships, career challenges, and practical manifestation in today’s world.

 You’ve guided thousands through courses, coaching, and live events. What has been your strategy in expanding your reach and creating lasting transformation at scale?

 My strategy has always been to let the energy flow through me rather than forcing a curriculum. Every live event is different because I tune into what the souls in the room are bringing down. The examples that come through are usually exactly what people are thinking about or going through.

 The key to scaling transformation is understanding that each person’s soul knows their truth. I’m not trying to convince anyone of anything.. I’m providing the spiritual technology and letting people’s own souls do the work. When someone has that “a-ha” moment where they realize they’ve always known this intuitively but never had a framework for it, that’s when real transformation happens.

 I’ve also focused on creating multiple touchpoints – from introductory courses like “Your Infinite Soul” and “Infinite Abundance” to deeper in-person seminars like “Reincarnation, Astrology, and The Deep Secrets of Past Lives” so people can engage at whatever level they’re ready for. The goal is always to help people align with the flow of life and create a reality where miracles are not only possible but immediate.

 What trends do you see shaping the future of personal growth and spiritual accessibility—especially as technology, wellness, and consciousness begin to intersect more deeply?

 Technology is becoming a powerful vessel for spreading spiritual wisdom to people who might never walk into a traditional spiritual center. We’re now able to take six-hour live seminars and create digital courses that people can access from anywhere in the world.

 But the most important trend I see is people recognizing that true fulfillment doesn’t come from external achievements alone. There’s a growing understanding that we need to work with unseen forces – the spiritual system that’s actually dictating everything in our lives.

 The intersection of wellness and consciousness is powerful because people are starting to understand that their thoughts, emotions, and spiritual state directly impact their physical reality. Kabbalah has always taught this… that every painful thing we’re going through, or every aspect of fulfillment we want to draw in, doesn’t happen in the physical world. It happens on a spiritual plane. This is what we will explore together.

 With growing conversations around authenticity and ethics in the personal development industry, how do you approach transparency and integrity in your own work?

 Integrity is everything in this work. I always share from my own life experiences and the real challenges I’ve faced. In my teachings, I use examples from my own marriage, my experience with scaling the MaryRuth Organics business, my own struggles with certainty, and my own process of learning to let go and trust.

 The ethical foundation of Kabbalah is that receiving is only spiritual when it’s for the purpose of sharing. I teach people that the Creator wants them to receive so they can share and create more light in the world. It’s never about accumulating for ego or personal gain alone.

 I also emphasize that only each person knows what’s best for them – only their soul knows their truth. I’m not there to tell people what to do; I’m there to give them the spiritual tools to access their own inner wisdom and connection with the Creator.

 You often emphasize the connection between business success and spiritual consciousness. How can entrepreneurs and leaders apply these principles in practical ways?

 The fundamental principle is understanding that we’re meant to be vessels for infinite abundance. When you align your business with spiritual consciousness, you’re not just trying to make money, you’re creating a channel for the Creator’s energy to flow through you to serve others.

 Practically, this means:

 * Recognizing that your desire for success comes from the fulfillment of that success already existing and calling you toward it
* Understanding that limitations come from our own vessel, not from external circumstances
* Making business decisions from a place of certainty and connection with the Creator rather than fear or reactive patterns
* Seeing your team and customers as souls you’re meant to serve, not just sources of profit

 I often tell entrepreneurs that when you’ve done your spiritual work and you’re fully safe with the Creator, the business decisions become clear. Your intuition becomes your guide, and synchronicities start showing up to support your path.

 What’s next for you in 2025 and beyond, both in your spiritual teaching and entrepreneurial ventures?

 My passion remains bringing Kabbalah to the world, and I’m expanding how we can reach people at scale. We’re taking the live seminar experience around the world, and also creating digital products on a pay-what-feels-right-to-you model, making this wisdom accessible to anyone regardless of their financial situation or location. We’re also leveraging AI so that soon, people can get personalized insights sourced from two decades of my teachings.

 The goal is to build the biggest digital product space where I can share these teachings through multiple formats… longer courses with deep study, shorter thematic challenges, coaching programs, 1:1 support, and continued live events. Each format serves people at different stages of their spiritual journey.

 But beyond the business expansion, my deepest intention remains the same: helping people understand that they are so powerful, that the Creator loves them so much, and that infinite energy is surrounding them right now, wanting to be revealed. Any thought to the contrary is just the negative side doing its job to make them choose their true power.

 We’re moving into a time where miracles will become more immediate for those who align with these principles. My role is to help as many people as possible access their infinite soul and step into the reality they came here to experience.
