 Meet the Local Owners:

 The new bar is owned and operated by local entrepreneurs Azure White, Jeremy White, and Bailee Read; a family team bringing a shared passion for beauty and hospitality to their hometown. The idea of opening Blo Blow Dry Bar in Las Vegas originated with Azure, a hairstylist with over 30 years of experience who later transitioned into real estate. Jeremy, who has lived in the area for over 35 years, brings decades of hospitality expertise from working with major brands like MGM and Caesars. Bailee, a Las Vegas native like her mother, has a background in marketing, having worked with companies such as BMW and HBO Max. Together, they’re proud to launch a family-owned business rooted in their professional strengths and deep connection to the Las Vegas community.

 “Las Vegas is where I was raised, where I made a career, and where I raised my family,” said Azure. “I have so much love for this city, and getting to bring a business that I believe strongly in is such a privilege. I am excited to share this with my home community, and I look forward to helping women feel their best, which was always my favorite part of being a stylist.”

 To celebrate the opening, guests can take advantage of the following special offers:

 * Discounted Blowouts: Purchase a single blowout for $50 (offer valid from Sept. 19 to Sept. 25).
* Bring a Bestie: Both guests receive a free head massage add-on when booking together! Offer valid from Sept. 19 to Sept. 30.
