# Q&amp;A with Steve Dell’Orto, Founder &amp; CEO of ConCntric

Steve Dell’Orto is the founder and CEO of ConCntric, a preconstruction platform that is transforming the fractured preconstruction environment by unifying data, people and processes. ConCntric acts as a single source of truth for all preconstruction stakeholders by providing a dynamic view of the project that ensures certainty of outcome. Steve is also the founding member of “Built by Builders” network, a collaboration of construction tech startups led by founders with firsthand industry experience.

 What inspired the launch of Built by Builders, and how did your background as a construction executive inform its founding mission?

 After more than 26 years in construction, including leading landmark projects like the Golden State Warriors’ Chase Center, Salesforce Tower, and Facebook’s Park Tower, I saw firsthand how technology adoption in our industry lagged behind its potential. Many tools in the market were built without a proper understanding of construction’s day-to-day realities. When I began developing our preconstruction platform, ConCntric, the feedback from customers was immediate: they trusted solutions built by people who had walked in their shoes and experienced the same challenges firsthand.

 Built by Builders was born out of that insight. It’s a network of construction technology companies founded by builders, united by firsthand industry experience and a shared commitment to solving real challenges. Together, we focus on developing practical, high-impact solutions and fostering a trusted space for collaboration. By grounding innovation in deep knowledge of the built environment, we aim to drive adoption and help create a more sustainable, efficient future for construction.

 Could you describe the current membership lineup and how each contributes unique value?

 Our founding members represent eight innovative companies, each solving a different pain point in construction:

 * Clearstory – Change Order Management Platform
* ConCntric – AI-Powered Preconstruction Management Platform
* Document Crunch – AI Risk Reduction Platform for Construction
* Kaster – Payroll and Compliance Management Tool
* PLOT – Worksite Procurement and Delivery Logistics Platform
* ProjectMark – Construction CRM and Marketing System
* SALUS – Safety Management Software
* Togal.AI – AI-powered Estimating Tool

 Each member brings deep construction roots and domain expertise, ensuring our combined knowledge covers everything from preconstruction planning to field safety and project delivery.

 How often do you admit new companies into the network, and what is the application process like?

 We welcome companies founded or led by individuals with substantial construction industry experience. While we plan to grow, every new member must meet these criteria and bring a unique perspective or capability to the table. Currently, we open applications once a year, and the 2025 application window has just closed. Leaders interested in joining are encouraged to reach out to be added to our list for notification when the 2026 application window opens.

 What criteria must a company meet to become part of Built by Builders, and is industry experience the key factor?

 Industry experience in the AEC sector is absolutely essential; it’s what gives the Built by Builders name and badge credibility. Members are leaders with a strong track record across architecture, engineering, or construction, and have built tools or services that address real-world challenges in the field. We also look for a collaborative spirit, a willingness to share insights openly, and a commitment to improving the built environment for all.

 In what ways does the network elevate the industry’s tech dialogue, both in the U.S. and globally?

 We’re creating a platform for authentic conversations about technology’s role in the AEC industry, driven by leaders who have delivered real projects, not just products.. Through webinars, shared resources, and industry events, we explore topics from AI in estimating and compliance to improving knowledge transfer as a third of our workforce nears retirement.

 Because our members operate across North America and beyond, we can share lessons and solutions that resonate globally. We’re helping the industry move past hype and toward adoption models that deliver measurable productivity gains, standardization, and more intelligent workflows.

 Networking can be essential to community-building. How does Built by Builders foster connection?

 Built by Builders fosters connection by bringing construction leaders together around shared experience. Our members host webinars, share lessons learned, and engage in open conversations that advance the industry. We also organize networking happy hours alongside larger industry conferences and events, welcoming anyone in construction to create space for authentic relationship-building. These touchpoints strengthen trust, spark collaboration, and give the broader community a glimpse of the value builders can unlock when they work together.

 What are the future plans with this association?

 In 2025, we’re expanding our educational offerings with more topic-specific webinars and deeper thought leadership on AI, workforce development, and sustainability. We’re also developing our Medium blog into a central hub for resources and insights on the industry’s most pressing challenges. Looking ahead, we plan to strategically grow our membership by bringing in leaders from different disciplines, regions, and areas of expertise to ensure we are solving problems with a truly holistic and field-tested perspective.
