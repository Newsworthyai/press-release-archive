# My Panda and Juricon.ai Step Into the Spotlight on Go Fund Yourself Season 3, Episode 5

Go Fund Yourself, the national pitch show airing on Cheddar TV, continues to attract ambitious founders and seasoned investors. The series, now in its third season, has established itself as a high-visibility platform where startups not only compete for investment but also gain access to invaluable mentorship and exposure. Season 3, Episode 5 airs Thursday, September 4 at 7PM ET and features two companies addressing everyday challenges with innovative solutions: My Panda and Juricon.ai.

 The Value of Exposure

 For early-stage ventures, visibility can be as important as capital. Appearing on Go Fund Yourself means pitching in front of a national audience while receiving direct feedback from the show’s Titans: Rory Cutaia, David Meltzer, and Jayson Waller. Each brings decades of entrepreneurial and leadership experience, offering insight into scaling strategies, investor readiness, and long-term sustainability.

 The exposure doesn’t end with the broadcast. Startups featured on the show often see a surge of customer interest, increased investor outreach, and expanded networks. For founders navigating the uphill climb of early growth, this kind of momentum can accelerate timelines and open doors that might otherwise take years to access.

 

 My Panda: A Local Solution with National Potential

 My Panda (Personal Assistants Next Door App) was founded to address a challenge familiar to many working parents: the lack of affordable, trusted support for day-to-day tasks. By connecting users to “Pandas” in their own neighborhoods who are available to help with errands, pet care, or household chores, the platform aims to strengthen community ties while creating flexible, livable-wage jobs.

 Already recognized by entrepreneurial programs at Georgia Tech, Emory University, and the City of Atlanta, My Panda has proven demand in its initial markets and is poised for expansion. Appearing on Go Fund Yourself gives the company a national stage to showcase how its model can scale into other regions, leveraging technology to revive the concept of “it takes a village.”

Its proprietary AI then matches them with attorneys whose real-world case experience best fits the situation, delivering higher-quality leads for lawyers and better outcomes for clients.

 Juricon operates at the intersection of B2C and B2B. On one side, it simplifies access for individuals and businesses seeking legal expertise; on the other, it provides attorneys with pre-qualified leads that reduce intake inefficiencies. Early traction in 2025 has positioned the company as a potential disruptor in a market long overdue for innovation. Presenting on Go Fund Yourself allows Juricon to validate its business model to both
