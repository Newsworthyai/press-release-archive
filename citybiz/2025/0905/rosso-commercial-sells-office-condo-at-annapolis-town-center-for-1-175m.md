# Rosso Commercial Sells Office Condo at Annapolis Town Center for $1.175M

Rosso Commercial Real Estate has arranged the sale of a 2,600-square-foot Class-A office condominium at 1906 Towne Centre Boulevard in Annapolis Town Center for $1,175,000.

 The seller, a longtime owner who originally purchased and occupied the unit following the center’s 2008 construction, recently retired from his law practice. Initially engaged to lease the space, Rosso Commercial identified a strategic opportunity to transition to a sale. Ross Westholm, Principal at Rosso Commercial, structured a creative owner-financing transaction that provided the client with both a meaningful capital event and ongoing cash flow through long-term interest income.

 “This deal showcases the importance of adaptability and client-focused strategy in commercial real estate,” said Westholm. “By pivoting from a leasing assignment to a tailored sale structure, we were able to deliver the best possible outcome for our client.”

 Located within the 2 million-square-foot Annapolis Town Center — anchored by Whole Foods Market, Target, and Life Time — the office condo is part of a vibrant mixed-use hub with retail, residential, and office offerings that continues to serve as a central gathering place for the Annapolis community.

 Annapolis Town Center continues to thrive as a vibrant destination for shopping, dining, residential living, and business, serving as a central hub for the greater Annapolis community.

 Ross Westholm at Rosso Commercial represented the seller and George Shenas at Hyatt Commercial represented the Buyer in this transaction.
