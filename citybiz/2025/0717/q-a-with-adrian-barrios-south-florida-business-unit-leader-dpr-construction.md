# Q&amp;A with Adrian Barrios, South Florida Business Unit Leader, DPR Construction

For Adrian Barrios, construction is about more than building facilities; it’s about building relationships and changing people’s lives. As DPR Construction’s South Florida Business Unit Leader, Adrian is responsible for the performance and execution of all work in South Florida from Miami-Dade County to Palm Beach County. His extensive healthcare background and deep understanding of what customers need to succeed have helped DPR to become one of South Florida’s largest and most admired healthcare builders.

 Since joining DPR 2013, he has been involved in construction projects valued at $370 million throughout the tri-county area. More than 75 commercial construction projects are included on his extensive career portfolio, since he started his career in 2008. He has overseen all phases of healthcare projects in the private and public sectors and is familiar with the sensitivities of working on occupied facilities and adhering to strict AHCA guidelines.

 A South Florida native, who spent part of his early childhood in Venezuela, Adrian grew up working outside with his dad fixing and building things. Summer jobs replacing roofs on neighbor’s houses eventually led to work as a laborer on job sites and degrees in the field.

 Because of our deep roots in health care, we are easily able to handle projects tied to such emerging trends as outpatient services and expanded women’s health and pediatric centers. We’re also growing in a number of other areas, including higher education sports facilities and class A+ commercial office buildings and buildouts . We also expertly handle life sciences and advanced technology opportunities with our national clients.

 He earned a bachelor’s degree in building construction and a master’s degree in architectural studies with a concentration in sustainable design from the University of Florida. He holds certifications as a LEED Accredited Professional (AP) from the US Green Building Council, in safety from OSHA, CPR/First Aid and AED Safety, and is a licensed general contractor.

 Adrian appreciates being part of an organization that truly prioritizes the health, safety and wellbeing of people. As a leader, he tries to show up at all times with no ego, encouraging everyone to use their unique attributes and talents, and he hopes that his genuineness encourages others to be comfortable doing the same.

 Who is DPR Construction and how did you come to South Florida?

 A self-performing general contractor, DPR in South Florida is part of the California-based private, employee-owned DPR family of companies that was founded in 1990 (by Doug, Peter and Ron) and employs more than 12,000 administrative and craft professionals across the world. We came to South Florida 20 years ago through life science contracts with Scripps Research Institute, followed by Max Planck. Over the last two decades our business unit has grown to become a leading contractor for most of the healthcare providers in the area. In addition to health care and life sciences, our core markets are commercial, advanced technology, and higher education.

 We currently handle approximately $260 million in construction projects per year throughout Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties. More than 100 employees work out of our office in Fort Lauderdale.

 At the core of our success in South Florida is a measured and sustainable approach to growth that has enabled us to avoid the dramatic peaks and valleys that plague others in the industry. This approach has allowed for true, long-term development of our people with challenging work that creates great builders.

 Another differentiator is the diversity of our team, which reflects the multi-cultural makeup of the South Florida community. Diversity in backgrounds, perspectives and experiences creates a deep and healthy culture that translates into better customer service. By celebrating diversity, removing friction and fostering an empowered and inclusive environment, DPR customers benefit from the transparent communications and subject matter expertise in areas that matter.

 My love of construction started at an early age. After college, I joined a local construction management firm that was focusing on large higher education and healthcare projects, which then led me to a major healthcare provider. I then joined DPR in 2013.

 I am a South Florida native but spent part of my early childhood in Venezuela with my Cuban mother and Venezuelan father. Today, I lead the South Florida Business Unit and live in the community that I love with my wife and two daughters.

 To me, construction is more than building facilities; it’s about building relationships and changing lives. Although we are part of a global enterprise, we operate like a local business with a family-like culture that embraces the diversity of thoughts, ideas and perspectives our team members bring to the table.

 The construction field is very competitive. How does DPR stand out?

 At DPR, we are an integral and indispensable part of our community. Delivering excellence to our customers starts with prioritizing the health, safety and wellbeing of our own people. I work hard to show up at all times with no ego, encouraging everyone to use their unique attributes and talents.

 The global capabilities at our disposal at DPR enable us to provide our customers with the very latest and best technology, project management tools and deep experience in the core market areas that are our specialties. We focus on prefabrication as a means to lower risks inherent on our jobsites and have proven successes in other markets with world-class prefabrication. Therefore, we are able to bring those ideas to our customers and design partners. As a self-performing general contractor, we also offer a skilled craft workforce, each of whom is trained, developed and able to produce truly great results consistently on our projects.

 Each project team is assembled based on a customer’s needs, concerns and goals. We are committed to transparent communications throughout a project and work hard every day to build trusting relationships.

 What is unique at the DPR approach?

 Through the DPR family of companies we have an extension of resources that enables us to streamline what is often a disjointed process. We are able to efficiently integrate every phase, from design, preconstruction, procurement, production, assembly and construction to post-construction. Creating this holistic approach is possible with our extensive capabilities, including prefabrication, supply chain management and the latest technologies that bring real time data to our customers quickly so that they can make timely decisions on their projects

 What are DPR’s future plans for South Florida?

 South Florida offers extensive opportunities for us at DPR. Because of our deep roots in health care, we are easily able to handle projects tied to such emerging trends as outpatient services and expanded women’s health and pediatric centers. We’re also growing in a number of other areas, including higher education sports facilities and class A+ commercial office buildings and buildouts . We also expertly handle life sciences and advanced technology opportunities with our national clients.

 South Florida continues to grow, and we plan to grow with it.
