# Q&amp;A with Asdrúbal Pichardo, CEO of Squalify

Asdrúbal Pichardo is a senior technology executive with a broad and unique combination of experience in growing solutions, business units, markets and revenues. He’s currently the CEO of Squalify, a Munich based Start-Up, providing a Cyber Risk Quantification solution aimed at the C-Suite to make cyber risk measurable and manageable at the strategic level.

 Before joining Squalify he was the CEO of Vernaio, a SaaS AI company helping production companies to become more efficient and sustainable. Prior to Vernaio, he was the CEO of FactoryPal, a corporate Start-Up offering a SaaS solution to increase manufacturing efficiency by leveraging AI and IoT technology. Before joining FactoryPal, he was the EVP & GM Europe at Corporater, a global SaaS company providing Risk & Compliance Management (GRC) solutions. He also spent 12 years at SAP, Europe’s largest Software company, where he held several leadership positions.

 We saw a clear signal: U.S. organizations are under mounting pressure– from regulators, boards, and insurers– to treat cybersecurity not just as a technical issue, but as a measurable business risk.

 In addition to management and executive education at MIT and INSEAD, Asdrúbal holds a Computer Science and a M.Sc. degree in Advanced Computing from King’s College London.

 Tell us about Squalify. What does it do, and what makes your platform different?

 Squalify is a cyber risk quantification (CRQ) platform designed to help C-level leaders understand and manage cybersecurity in business terms. Rather than starting with technical controls or vulnerabilities, we take a top-down approach: identifying which business scenarios would be most financially damaging and quantifying that exposure in dollars. This allows CISOs, CFOs, CROs, and boards to prioritize the risks that matter most, allocate resources strategically, and measure ROI with confidence.

 What sets Squalify apart is the foundation we’ve built upon. We’re the official licensee of Munich Re’s proprietary cyber risk model– one of the most advanced, underwriting-grade CRQ models in the world. Backed by the world’s leading cyber reinsurer, we have access to more than a decade of global cyber loss data, enabling our platform to deliver consistent, credible, and defensible financial risk insights.

 With Squalify, organizations can go beyond compliance checklists to adopt ROI-driven security strategies that align with enterprise risk, enable executive oversight, and deliver measurable business value.

 Why did you choose to expand into the U.S. market?

 We saw a clear signal: U.S. organizations are under mounting pressure– from regulators, boards, and insurers– to treat cybersecurity not just as a technical issue, but as a measurable business risk. That shift is accelerating demand for solutions that can translate cyber threats into financial terms and support ROI-driven security strategies. It’s precisely where Squalify creates the most value.

 Our first U.S. customer, Henry Meds, exemplifies this evolution. As a fast-scaling digital health company in a highly regulated industry, they needed a way to demonstrate to their board how cybersecurity risks impact business outcomes– and where investments would generate the greatest return. With Squalify, they’re now able to quantify those risks, model financial exposure, and guide decisions with clarity and confidence.

 What are the key enhancements you’ve made to the platform?

 We’ve introduced powerful new capabilities designed to support global organizations managing cyber risk across complex structures and evolving priorities. These include:

 Subsidiary Steering – Enables CISOs and cyber leaders to measure and manage risk consistently across multiple entities, business units, or regions– all using a standardized, data-driven quantification model.

 Decision Simulations – Models the financial impact of strategic choices, such as M&A activity, control upgrades, or defense shifts, allowing leaders to compare outcomes before making high-stakes decisions.

 Board of Management Report – A streamlined, visual dashboard that translates technical risk data into board-ready business intelligence– clearly showing how risk is evolving, where losses could concentrate, and which actions drive the greatest ROI.

 Together, these enhancements give organizations the tools to make faster, more strategic, and financially grounded cybersecurity decisions at every level.

 What industries are you focused on in the U.S.?

 We’re seeing the strongest momentum in sectors where cyber risk, regulatory expectations, and financial accountability are converging– especially digital health, financial services, manufacturing, and insurance. These industries face growing pressure to demonstrate that cybersecurity investments are not only compliant, but also cost-effective and value-aligned.

 Squalify helps bridge the communication gap between technical teams and business leadership, making it easier to justify security spend and drive smarter, ROI-focused decisions in high-stakes environments.

 What broader vision is driving your growth?

 We’re on a mission to redefine how organizations understand and manage cyber risk: not as a siloed IT problem, but as a core element of business strategy.

 That means replacing fear-based narratives with fact-based decision-making, shifting from reactive firefighting to proactive risk planning, and turning fragmented reporting into shared accountability across the executive team.

 Ultimately, our goal is to make cybersecurity measurable, strategic, and fully aligned with how companies operate, grow, and protect value– fostering a more resilient global economy.
