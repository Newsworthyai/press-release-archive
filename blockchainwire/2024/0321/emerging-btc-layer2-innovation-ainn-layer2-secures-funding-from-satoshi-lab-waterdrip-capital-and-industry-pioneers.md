It has also integrated a block explorer and official bridging tools. The mainnet is expected to go live on March 31st, Easter Sunday, when staking activities for BTC, BRC20 assets, and other types of assets will be initiated, and more innovative features will be unveiled with the mainnet launch.

After the mainnet launch, these eligible inscriptions can stake on the mainnet to receive generous rewards. This event is also an industry-wide event, with inscriptions from EVM, Solana, and other ecosystems having corresponding staking platforms.
