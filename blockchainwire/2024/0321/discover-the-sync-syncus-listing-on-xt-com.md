# Discover the SYNC (Syncus) Listing on XT.COM

XT.COM, the worldâ€™s first socially infused trading platform, is thrilled to announce the listing of SYNC(Syncus) on its platform in the Innovation zone (DeFi) and the SYNC/USDT trading pair started from 2024-03-11 10:00 (UTC).

About SYNC

SYNC is a ERC-20 token deployed on the Ethereum blockchain with an approximate max supply of 4.2 billion tokens. The SYNC token is designed to power the Syncus ecosystem, offering users a seamless and efficient way to engage in decentralized finance activities. As the native token of Syncus, SYNC plays a pivotal role in facilitating transactions, governance, and ecosystem growth.

The journey of SYNC began with a fair launch on November 25th, where participants contributed 188 ETH within a short span of 5 minutes, emphasizing inclusivity and community involvement. This launch model ensured a wide distribution of tokens, laying the foundation for a decentralized ecosystem. With a backed price of $0.0001 per token, SYNC exemplifies accessibility and affordability, making it appealing to both seasoned investors and newcomers to the crypto space.

One of the key features of SYNC is its adaptive taxation strategy, which dynamically adjusts taxes on sell and un-staking transactions based on market conditions. During periods of significant price increase, taxes may be temporarily increased to mitigate speculative trading and ensure protocol stability. Conversely, during market stability, taxes are re-evaluated and reduced accordingly, maintaining fairness and proportionality. This innovative approach showcases Syncus' commitment to long-term sustainability and ecosystem growth.

SYNC distinguishes itself by incentivizing long-term holding and staking, aligning with Syncus' vision for sustainable growth and stability. By discouraging frequent trading and rewarding committed stakeholders, SYNC fosters a community-driven ecosystem where participants are vested in the protocol's success. This emphasis on long-term engagement underscores Syncus' dedication to building a robust and resilient DeFi platform for the future.

Albin Warin, CEO of XT.COM, verbally emphasized the token's unique value proposition and its significance within the Syncus project. Warin commented, "We are thrilled to welcome SYNC to the XT.com platform, as it represents a pioneering approach to decentralized finance. SYNC's adaptive taxation strategy and emphasis on long-term holding align perfectly with our vision for fostering sustainable growth within the crypto ecosystem."
