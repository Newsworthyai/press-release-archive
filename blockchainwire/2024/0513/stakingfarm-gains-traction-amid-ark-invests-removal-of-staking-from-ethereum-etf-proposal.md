# StakingFarm Gains Traction Amid Ark Invest’s Removal of Staking from Ethereum ETF Proposal

StakingFarm is pleased to announce a significant increase in ETH staking signups on its platform following the recent changes in Ark Invest’s Ethereum ETF proposal. The revised proposal by Ark Invest and 21shares has notably removed previously included options for staking, prompting a notable shift of investors towards platforms like StakingFarm that specialize in crypto staking services.

"With the changes in Ark Invest’s ETF proposal, we have seen a remarkable uptick in users seeking reliable staking options on our platform," stated Klajdi Toci, CEO of StakingFarm. "Our platform is well-equipped to meet this growing demand, offering users a secure and profitable way to stake their Ethereum."

Impact of Ark Invest’s ETF Proposal Changes

Ark Invest, led by renowned investor Cathie Wood, and 21shares have modified their proposal for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) by removing the staking component. Initially, the proposal included options for engaging trusted staking providers to manage part of the trust’s assets, a strategy aimed at leveraging network participation rewards.

This strategic pivot away from staking underscores a cautious alignment with regulatory perspectives and evolving market conditions. Fidelity’s ETH-based ETF had previously set a precedent by proposing staking options, highlighting the significance of this shift by Ark Invest and 21shares.
