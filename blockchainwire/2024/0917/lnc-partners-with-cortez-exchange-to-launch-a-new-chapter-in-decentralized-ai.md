LNC: An Innovative Decentralized AI Platform

The LNC project addresses key issues in AI development through blockchain technology, such as data centralization, high development costs, and inadequate privacy protection. Traditional AI development relies on centralized data storage, which increases data security risks. The LNC platform enables data owners to trade and share data freely and securely while protecting their privacy.

Additionally, LNC leverages Lightning Network technology to enhance transaction speed and reduce costs, allowing global developers and businesses to participate more flexibly in AI project development and deployment. The LNC platform also supports the sharing of distributed computing resources, lowering the costs of AI model development. This innovative model not only supports large enterprises but also provides opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises to enter the AI field.
