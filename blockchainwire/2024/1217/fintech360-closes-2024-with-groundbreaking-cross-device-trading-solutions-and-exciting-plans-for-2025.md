Mobile Usage Soars in 2024: A Key Driver for Cross-Device Innovation

In 2024, mobile devices continued to dominate the digital landscape, accounting for over 60% of global web traffic and playing an even larger role in the financial sector. This trend highlights the importance of mobile-optimized solutions for brokers aiming to engage modern traders effectively. FinTech360’s cross-device platform directly addresses this shift, enabling brokers to meet the needs of their increasingly mobile-first clientele by providing seamless access to trading tools anytime, anywhere.

With mobile traffic now accounting for the majority of user interactions in the financial sector, our cross-device solutions arrive at a pivotal moment for brokers aiming to stay competitive. The platform equips brokers with advanced tools for customer lifecycle management, CRM, payment gateways, and trading signals, all accessible from any device, offering flexibility and convenience to both brokers and traders.

"In response to the growing dominance of mobile usage in trading, we are proud to introduce our cross-device solutions, which allow brokers to offer their clients uninterrupted access to trading tools on any platform," said Aaron Bitter, BDM of FinTech360. "We recognize that brokers need to cater to mobile-first users, and our new solutions provide the perfect balance between functionality and accessibility across all devices."
