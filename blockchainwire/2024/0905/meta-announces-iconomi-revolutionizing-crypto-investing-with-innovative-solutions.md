Why Millennials and Gen X Should Consider Crypto for Long-Term Investing

Traditional investing principles like diversification have long been proven to deliver steady growth and minimize losses over time. But why stop at stocks, bonds, and real estate? Cryptocurrencies are increasingly recognized as an essential component of a modern, diversified portfolio, especially for Millennials and Gen X investors who are looking to future-proof their wealth.

ICONOMI bridges this gap by introducing traditional investors to digital assets through intuitive crypto portfolios. By offering a variety of managed strategies, such as the Blockchain Index (BLX) and BEX, ICONOMI provides an intuitive and less intimidating entry into crypto investing.

ICONOMI's Flagship Crypto Strategies: BLX and BEX

ICONOMI offers a suite of over 200 crypto strategies tailored for different risk tolerances and investment objectives. Among these, the Blockchain Index (BLX) and BEX strategies stand out as powerful options for those looking to gain exposure to the crypto market with minimal hassle.

The Blockchain Index (BLX) is a passively managed strategy that invests in established blockchain projects with active beta components. It is market-cap weighted with fixed allocations to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), and focuses on nascent projects with potential strategic importance for the future distributed economy. This strategy is ideal for investors seeking a diversified, long-term investment approach that taps into the growth of blockchain technology.

The BEX strategy prioritizes BTC and ETH, dynamically adjusting its holdings based on market cap and risk. It employs an automated approach, rebalancing weekly to maintain a balanced, risk-aware portfolio that adapts to the ever-evolving crypto narrative. The BEX strategy is suited for investors who want to benefit from the leading cryptocurrencies while maintaining flexibility in a volatile market.
