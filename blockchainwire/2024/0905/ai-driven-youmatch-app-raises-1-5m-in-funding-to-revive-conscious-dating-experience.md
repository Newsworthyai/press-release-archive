Founded in early 2024, YouMatch.ai redefines the dating landscape by leveraging scientific research to enhance human connections.

In symbiosis with the latest human-science discoveries it creates a completely unique method.

In recent years, AI facial recognition has established itself as an indispensable technology that made its way to multiple areas, including banking, HR. After accumulating international research and the experience of global corporations, YouMatch advanced AI facial recognition and adapted it to the dating industry, the new way of matchmaking, that transformed the industry - a person first understands himself better and his own personal characteristics, and then consciously enters into acquaintance with the match. Like in popular series about the future of relations, the technology now can implement comprehensive personality analysis, discovering user’s behavioral traits, individual needs, and potential risks just by the shot of a frontal camera. Relying on a compatibility analysis, AI-driven algorithms ensure precise matches that are likely to grow into healthy and harmonious relationships when both partners’ needs are fulfilled.
