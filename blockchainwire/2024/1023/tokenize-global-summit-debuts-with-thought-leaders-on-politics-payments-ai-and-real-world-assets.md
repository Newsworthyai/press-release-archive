# Tokenize! Global Summit Debuts With Thought Leaders on Politics, Payments, AI and Real-World Assets

Tokenize! will hold its first Global Summit in Las Vegas on October 29-31, at an extravagant 18,000 square foot celebrity mansion on a two-acre, gated estate in Las Vegas’ most exclusive neighborhood,  just minutes from the Las Vegas Strip.  The VIP summit will feature a section called Tokenize Politics, featuring a fireside chat with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.  Held less than one week before the hotly contested US presidential election in the swing state of Nevada, the summit will also feature advisors and advocates for both former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.

Paul Manafort, former campaign chairman for Donald Trump’s successful 2016 presidential campaign, has embraced blockchain and cryptocurrency and has been one of the key advisors shaping Trump’s current pro-bitcoin policies.  He will address how the current political crossfire has affected the crypto investment and innovation markets in a fireside chat with former NASDAQ managing director of strategy Enzo Villani.

The conference kicks off on Tuesday, October 29, with a cocktail party in front of the estate’s 80,000-gallon swimming pool, complete with voluminous water features and a jacuzzi grotto.  A private dinner, sponsored by ALTX, the first agentic digital asset terminal, will take place inside the mansion immediately following the opening party.
