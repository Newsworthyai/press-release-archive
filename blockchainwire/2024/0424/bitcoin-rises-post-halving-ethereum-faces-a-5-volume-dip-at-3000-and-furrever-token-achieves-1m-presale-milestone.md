# Bitcoin Rises Post-Halving, Ethereum Faces a 5% Volume Dip at $3,000, and Furrever Token Achieves $1M Presale Milestone

In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, three coins demonstrate distinct market behaviors with significant implications for investors and market watchers alike. Bitcoin (BTC) shows resilience and bullish trends after its fourth halving, as detailed in a recent Bitfinex report. Ethereum (ETH), however, faces uncertainties despite crossing significant price thresholds due to a concerning decline in trading volume. On a lighter note, Furrever Token (FURR) brings a refreshing twist to the market with its unique, community-centered approach, garnering substantial interest in its presale phase.

Bitcoin (BTC) Remains Bullish After Fourth Halving, According to Bitfinex Report

As the Bitcoin market navigates through its post-fourth-halving landscape, a recent report from Bitfinex Alpha reveals a notably bullish outlook. The dynamics in the market indicate that despite the usual pre-halving sell-offs, Bitcoin's value is expected to rise, supported by the efficient absorption of selling pressure by new market entrants.

The report elaborates on how miners have adapted their strategies in response to the halving, which reduces the daily Bitcoin supply to bolster its scarcity and value. Current estimates predict a decrease in daily supply from $40-$50 million to around $30 million, factoring in both active and dormant supplies as well as sales by miners. This adjustment is critical as smaller mining operations face profitability challenges, prompting them to either shut down or optimize their operations.

Historically, halving events trigger significant selling activity by miners aiming to maximize profits before anticipated drops in earnings. This time, however, miners preemptively sold their reserves, leading to a sharp decline in Bitcoin transfers to exchanges, which mitigates the risk of market shocks and spreads selling pressure over a more extended period.

Moreover, the growing demand and acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs have reshaped market dynamics for cryptocurrencies. The constrained supply resulting from the halving, coupled with robust ETF demand, is poised to significantly drive up Bitcoin prices, according to Bitfinex analysts. These ETFs play a crucial role in the market by attracting large capital inflows and managing outflows, further influencing Bitcoin's price trajectory post-halving.

Ethereum (ETH) Faces Uncertainty as Trading Volume Declines Despite Price Surge Above $3,000

Ethereum has recently surpassed the $3,000 mark, an event marked by crossing the 100 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) on the ETH/USD price chart. Despite this achievement, the cryptocurrency's future is looking uncertain due to a worrying decline in trading volume. This decrease in volume serves as a red flag, casting doubt on the sustainability of the recent price increase.

The trading dynamics show that Ethereum is struggling to convincingly break through the 26 EMA, a significant short-term moving average that is now acting as tough resistance. If Ethereum manages to overcome this hurdle, it might target higher levels around $3,236. However, failure to break past this resistance could see the price retreating to lower support levels, potentially around $2,890.

The key to Ethereum's immediate future lies in the trading volume. An increase in volume is crucial as it typically confirms market trends. Currently, the low trading volume indicates a lack of buyer commitment, which suggests that the price increase might not be backed by strong market support. Without a notable increase in trading volume and market liquidity, Ethereum's ability to maintain its position above $3,000 may be compromised, potentially stalling any further rallies.
