# BLAZE Investment Round Complete With Aim To Become Web3 Market Leader

StoryFire stands at the forefront of innovation, spearheading a revolutionary amalgamation of SocialFi, GameFi, and DeFi, culminating in an unprecedented all-encompassing experience. Recently, the company successfully concluded the BLAZE token investment round, securing backing from prominent entities including GDA Capital, Genesis Capital, Octavia Ventures, and TGE Ventures.

Expressing his enthusiasm, Sam Hilder, CEO of StoryFire, emphasized in a recent press release, "Closing a successful funding round amidst the prevailing macroeconomic conditions, with such esteemed partners, is indeed exhilarating. We are deeply grateful for the trust our investors have placed in us." Hilder further elucidated on the company's strategic vision, affirming their commitment to crafting the ultimate Web3 platform through the StoryFire offering, eagerly anticipating the unveiling of their latest developments.

Leading the investment consortium, Genesis Capital, a private equity powerhouse, orchestrated the funding round. The company delineated its intentions to leverage the capital infusion to propel both developmental initiatives and marketing endeavors leading up to the imminent BLAZE token launch.

In a strategic move underscoring StoryFire's steadfast commitment to the Web3 landscape, the company announced its purchase of assets from Tokens.com in February 2024, with it being that it has successfully closed the sale of Metaverse Group and Hulk Labs to StoryFire. The purchase entailed a disposition comprising a 15.3% equity stake in StoryFire, appraised at US$3.5 million, alongside an allocation of US$500,000 in BLAZE tokens. This strategic maneuver underscores StoryFire's enduring presence within the Web3 domain, as it endeavors to fortify and expand its footprint across the entire Web3 ecosystem.
