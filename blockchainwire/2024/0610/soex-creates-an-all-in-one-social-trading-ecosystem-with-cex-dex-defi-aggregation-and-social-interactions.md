# SOEX Creates an All-in-One Social Trading Ecosystem with CEX/DEX/DeFi Aggregation and Social Interactions

Recently, the Web3 IM SOEX, powered by protocols like Nostr+, TradeDivi, and Sketch, has successfully developed an integrated social trading ecosystem. This system combines social interactions across CEX/DEX/DeFi, allowing users to leverage community knowledge and data for trading. Opting for SOEX instead of conducting trades directly on exchanges yields higher returns, as users are rewarded through airdrops based on trading volume and commissions.

Introducing SOEX SOEX is an innovative platform set to revolutionize social trading and adapt it to Web3 necessities. By integrating instant messaging and trading, the app delivers a seamless experience in a balanced ecosystem that provides users multiple return streams. Essentially, SOEX solves the challenges users face when turning to web2 apps to gather the information needed for trading by creating a direct connection with traders holding and interested in the same tokens.

SOEX employs a multi-token strategy that includes $SOX points (used to track user contributions and receive rewards), $SOEX (the platform’s governance token), and TVBT, an equity NFT that opens the path to governance and unlocks various benefit opportunities within the platform.
