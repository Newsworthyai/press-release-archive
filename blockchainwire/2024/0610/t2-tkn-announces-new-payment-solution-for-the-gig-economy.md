# T2 TKN Announces New Payment Solution for the Gig Economy

What is T2 TKN and what does it solve?

T2 TKN is an innovative payment solution set to revolutionize transactional paradigms. Built on the foundation of ‘programmable payments’, T2 TKN enables users to program their payments for goods or services, in fiat or digital currencies, providing risk management for all parties. Every payment from T2 Wallet injects trust and transparency like never before, minimizing the risk of fraud, late payment and other payment problems that are escalating today. Whether you’re transacting for a camera or creative services or personal training sessions, or even if you’re a construction company building a property with many stakeholders, a T2 payment is just ‘set and send’.

Within T2 Wallet, users can also access a Freelancer and Classifieds marketplace to promote their goods or services for sale. This creates a complete ecosystem in which users can only transact with other trusted parties, making T2 Wallet a new payment standard. No more late payments, no more purchase cons and no more bad actors - just clean and straightforward transactions, as it should be.

4. Referral & Incentive Programs:

5. Arbitration Committee:

- T2 TKN understands that sometimes work isn’t delivered to the Client’s standard and to this extent, their payment programs have the ability to deny the release of funds and move to arbitration. And while the initial process for this will be offline, meaning the two parties arbitrate amongst themselves and then provide a verdict to the T2 TKN admins to release the funds appropriately, their team envisions a future in which T2 TKN users can act as community arbitrators for a dedicated service or business category. Think of it as the ‘community notes’ feature from Twitter, but for arbitrating the quality of services. Even greater is that any user participating as an arbitrator, provided they stake a certain amount of T2TKN and maintain a decent user rating on the platform, would receive income from every job they review, giving them a new passive income stream via the T2 ecosystem. People helping people, all powered by T2TKN.
