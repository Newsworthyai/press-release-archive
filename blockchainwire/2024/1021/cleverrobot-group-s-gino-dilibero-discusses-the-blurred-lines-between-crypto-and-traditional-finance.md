# CleverRobot Group's Gino Dilibero Discusses the Blurred Lines Between Crypto and Traditional Finance

"Historically, clients wanted advice, diversification, and had a vague, peripheral interest in crypto, specifically Bitcoin," Dilibero states.

"Now we are witnessing a shift, where the current trend is clients asking how digital asset holdings fit into the bigger picture," he adds. He explains that overall diversification is becoming the new norm, as many high-net-worth investors now include all their crypto holdings alongside other assets during a comprehensive financial analysis.

Dilibero underscores the significance of this shift by highlighting the growing sophistication of client inquiries. Previously, individuals approached cryptocurrencies with caution, often viewing them as a niche area for adventurous investment. Today, however, conversations around digital currencies have gained depth, with clients eager to understand the intricate dynamics between crypto markets and traditional financial avenues. This change not only marks an evolution in clients' financial strategies but also pushes financial advisors to broaden their expertise and offer a more well-rounded perspective.

Moreover, the implications of this trend reach beyond personal investment portfolios. Dilibero suggests that this integration signals a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies within mainstream financial systems. As institutional investors begin to recognize and incorporate digital assets in their frameworks, a significant change in the financial landscape is inevitable. This transition is characterized by a harmonization of traditional and digital asset management, reflecting a future where investors seamlessly traverse between both worlds without treating them as binary choices.

The new world is indeed here to stay. As digital currencies increasingly form a staple of modern investment portfolios, the industry must adapt to keep pace with both technological advancements and changing client demands. In this evolving landscape, the ability to effectively navigate and integrate these previously disparate spheres will serve as a key differentiator for financial professionals. This blending of traditional and digital finance marks not just a trend, but a fundamental transformation in how wealth is managed and perceived globally.
