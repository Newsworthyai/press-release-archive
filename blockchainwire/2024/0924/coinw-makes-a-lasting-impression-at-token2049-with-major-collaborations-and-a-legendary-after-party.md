This year, CoinW elevated its presence with a unique collaboration involving strategic partners from the Middle East, underscoring its growing influence and pivotal role in the region’s blockchain ecosystem.

A Standout Presence with Innovation on DisplayAt TOKEN2049, CoinW’s booth was impossible to miss. An eye-catching photo wall, featuring a vibrant map of Singapore in the exchange's signature violet hues, welcomed visitors and signaled their arrival at both the heart of the event and the gateway to CoinW’s world of blockchain innovation. Occupying a prime spot on the bustling exhibition floor, CoinW’s sleek, space-themed booth, symbolizing the limitless potential of blockchain, quickly became one of the most visited throughout the event.

The booth buzzed with activity as KOLs, crypto traders, and Web3 enthusiasts gathered to engage with CoinW's high-performance offerings. CoinW’s presence extended beyond its own innovations, as it shared the space with major UAE and Dubai government entities, including the Dubai Blockchain Center, the Blockchain Center Abu Dhabi, the UAE Ministry of Economy, and the Dubai Chamber of Digital Economy, further showcasing its role as a key player in the Middle East’s blockchain scene.

Shaw emphasized that simple, everyday use cases—particularly payments—would be the catalyst for bringing the next billion users from Web 2 into Web3. CoinW is dedicated to identifying and incubating high-potential projects, a mission being reinforced during the event.
