# Tidorx Exchange Launches Global Compliance Program, Expanding into Multiple Markets

Tidorx Exchange, an emerging player in the U.S. digital asset trading market, recently announced the official launch of its "Global Compliance Program," aimed at further expanding its global presence and ensuring business compliance across multiple countries and regions. The core objective of this program is to ensure that Tidorx operates in accordance with legal regulations while providing a safe and legitimate digital asset trading environment for global users. Tidorx has successfully obtained the MSB (Money Services Business) license from the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), marking a significant step in its compliance efforts.

According to Tidorx's global compliance strategy, the platform will not only continue to strengthen its compliance advantages in the U.S. market but also actively apply for compliance licenses in Europe, Asia, and other regions in the coming months. These compliance qualifications will enable Tidorx to operate legally in these areas, further enhancing its influence in the international market.

Tidorx must not only meet existing regulatory requirements but also prepare for future international expansion.

Currently, Tidorx's compliance team is actively engaging with financial regulatory authorities in Europe and Asia, preparing to apply for relevant licenses, including the EU financial license (MiFID II) and licenses from Asian financial hubs like Singapore and Hong Kong. Obtaining these compliance qualifications will provide Tidorx's global users with comprehensive legal protection and significantly enhance the platform's international credibility.
