# Store-to-Earn Platform Functionland Brings Blockchain Security to Photo and Video Storage, Announces Airdrop

Decentralized data storage platform Functionland has announced the launch of its $FULA token, which will play a crucial role in establishing the store-to-earn trend, accompanied by an airdrop campaign.

Functionland develops blockchain software and hardware to offer a secure and reliable alternative to traditional data storage services. Unlike the Big Tech-powered cloud services, which take control over how user data is processed and shared, Functionland’s DApps give full data ownership to individuals.

Supported by a global infrastructure of over 900 blockchain nodes, Functionland has launched two DApps — FxFotos for photo and video storage and FxFiles for general file storage — along with its decentralized storage hardware, FxBlox.

Crafted by renowned Swiss designer Yves Béhar, FxBlox operates as a blockchain-powered storage, personal server and node. It is at the heart of Functionland’s store-to-earn offerings. FxBlox owners will empower the decentralized storage network and earn rewards.

Functionland’s hardware and software solutions form the Fula Network, a peer-to-peer architecture for decentralized data management. Since the announcement of the testnet, the Fula Network has seen over 100,000 pre-registrations from both Web3 and Web2 communities.

Functionland is celebrating the launch of the $FULA token, the utility token of the Fula Network, with an airdrop campaign. Users can complete social tasks in Web3 fashion to participate in the $FULA airdrop. More details can be found here.

Fula Network enables fair, secure resource-sharing among users. Users share resources to provide storage, content and applications. The network comprises many smaller user pools, typically grouped together based on geographical proximity in order to guarantee optimal network performance, minimal latency and the fewest possible server hops.

Functionland was founded in 2021 with a clear vision and technical team in Ontario, Canada, with grants from blockchain giants, including Filecoin and Dfinity, after winning first place in the Filecoin Hackathon. The company is backed by Web3 heavyweights, including Protocol Labs, Delta Blockchain Fund, Outlier Ventures and Tenzor Capital, and it’s expanding its roster of investors with Astra X, Cogitent Ventures, and Connectico Capital.

“In the digital world, your data is your virtual avatar. It’s time to level up from being an NPC to the main character,” said Ehsan Shariati, the Co-founder of Functionland, adding: “At Functionland, we’re not just disrupting the decentralized storage game; we’re rewriting the rules. Our Fula platform is the cheat code for true data democracy, making secure, private storage as easy to use as your favorite social media app.”

By adding decentralized compute and decentralized AI protocols to the current stack, Functionland aims to pioneer data logistics for both Web2 and Web3, serving consumers, NFT projects, streaming services, and AI.
