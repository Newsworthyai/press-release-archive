# Intelagen Partners with Google Cloud to Deliver Integrity Assurance, Mitigate Hallucinations, and Reduce Bias for AI

Saint Petersburg, FL, July 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Intelagen, Google Cloud partner and vertical AI consultancy, today announced an enhanced partnership with Google Cloud that will enable it to build and offer new AI solutions to enhance responsible AI, deliver guardrails for safe, secure, and regulatory compliant AI, and operational governance for AI. Intelagen will also make its AI solutions available on Google Cloud Marketplace, as it is now recognized as an official Global Independent Software Vendor (ISV) Build partner in the Google Cloud Partner Advantage Program.

Intelagen will leverage Arhasi's R.A.P.I.D™ platform to deliver its IntelAGENT™ AI solutions. By utilizing a client-curated GenAI Agent, these solutions empower businesses to easily build virtual agents and AI assistants that provide a natural conversational experience for users interacting with enterprise document knowledge bases. This innovative approach also minimizes the risk of generating inaccurate or misleading information.

"Our partnership with Google Cloud reaching this milestone is a significant achievement. Together, we are uniquely positioned to provide SMB clients with groundbreaking solutions, driving towards our shared vision in the evolving AI landscape," said Tom Richer, CEO at Intelagen. "Being recognized as an official ISV Build partner with Google Cloud reinforces our commitment to developing vertical AI solutions that enhance humanity, empowering our clients to unlock new possibilities through AI."

To help accelerate its time to value for its marketplace listings on Google Marketplace, Intelagen forged a strategic partnership with cloud ecosystem co-sell and marketplace automation leader WorkSpan.

"Our collaboration with WorkSpan enabled seamless coordination across our engineering, partner, and marketing teams, laying the roadmap for the rapid launch of our listings within weeks, thanks to their efficient turnkey marketplace listing service," said Sam Ibrahim, Chief Channel and Revenue Officer at Intelagen. "Their invaluable partnership has been instrumental in our sprint to launch our IntelAGENT™ AI solutions on the Google Cloud Marketplace."

“Intelagen brings deep expertise and a world-class team to empower startups and SMBs to deliver innovative vertical AI solutions,” said Kijoon Lee, GM of Applications & SVP of Sales at WorkSpan. “WorkSpan enables AI solution companies to digitize and scale their partner revenue processes, and we’re thrilled to partner with Intelagen and help the company accelerate customer and revenue growth through the Google Cloud Marketplace.”
