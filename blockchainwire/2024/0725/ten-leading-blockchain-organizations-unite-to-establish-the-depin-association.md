Meet the Founding Members

1. Acurast: Enables developers with Unstoppable Compute through a decentaralized and mobile powered Cloud.

2. peaq: Provides DePINs a layer-1 blockchain tailored to their needs, including Modular DePIN Functions, DePIN-focused economics, grants for builders, and a vast network of enterprise partners and Web3 integrations.

3. DePINHub: A central hub for DePIN innovation, offering resources, support, and networking opportunities for projects and developers.

4. Powerledger: promotes democratization of energy through tracking, tracing and trading of energy in decentralized energy markets.

5. U2U Network: A pioneering Modular Layer-1 chain built on top of DAG and compatible with EVM. Boasting 17,000 TPS and 350-ms finality using the Helios Consensus, U2U Network is a perfect fit for DePIN

6. POKT (Pocket Network): The universal RPC Infra layer that enables our partners to connect applications with any open data source, with unbeatable scalability, uptime, and cost-effectiveness. The API to the open internet.

7. SafeJunction: A trustless database for provable facts, aiming to make proofs more accessible, secure, and ubiquitous.

8. IoTeX: Provides a modular infrastructure for DePIN projects to deploy in full or integrate modules into existing frameworks.

9. Geodnet: Leverages blockchain technology for geospatial data and services, improving the accuracy and availability of location-based information.

10. Impossible Cloud Network (ICN): The cloud platform that connects enterprise-grade hardware with cloud service providers while leveraging SLA oracles for uncompromised performance or service quality.

Vision and Mission

The Association aims to create a robust DePIN ecosystem:

-Establish industry standards and best practices for DePIN projects.

-Promote collaboration and knowledge sharing among members.

-Advocate for policies and regulations that support the growth of decentralized infrastructure.

-Foster an ecosystem that encourages innovation and sustainable development.

Future Plans

In the coming months, the DePIN Association will focus on several key initiatives:

Standardization: Developing and promoting industry standards to ensure interoperability and security across DePIN projects.

Research and Development: Supporting R&D efforts to advance the technology and applications of decentralized infrastructure.

Education and Outreach: Engaging with stakeholders, including policymakers, developers, and the public, to raise awareness about the benefits and potential of DePIN.

Events: Communication about the DePIN ecosystem with jointly-organized events.

Join the Movement

The DePIN Association invites other organizations, developers, and stakeholders interested in the future of decentralized infrastructure to join the movement. Together, we can build a more secure, efficient, and transparent world.
