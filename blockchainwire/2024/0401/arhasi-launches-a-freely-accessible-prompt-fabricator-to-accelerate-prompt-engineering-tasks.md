# Arhasi launches a freely accessible Prompt Fabricator to accelerate prompt engineering tasks.

Today, Arhasi, a thought leader in AI security, governance, and compliance, unveiled a complimentary service aimed at enhancing GenAI engineers' ability to expedite use case development. This service grants organizations immediate access to an intelligent AI chatbot, simplifying the creation of finely crafted input prompts for Large Language Models (LLM) through cutting-edge industry templates. The service additionally offers the option to upgrade, providing recommendations for the most suitable prompt template tailored to a specific input prompt.

Arhasi’s innovation studio is a comprehensive research initiative guided by a team boasting nearly a decade of expertise in crafting enterprise AI solutions. The studio is currently developing several solutions: the “Vani'' project integrates Digital Twins with AI to enhance real-time response capabilities, while their “Vajra” project focuses on protecting interconnected AI systems from cyber threats.

Arhasi advocates for fluid conversation flows, prioritizing the integration of AI security and governance as essential components for the success of AI initiatives. Whether it's a chatbot, design assistant, application, or workflow, each serves as a conduit for fluid conversation flows. Thus, it became crucial for them to demonstrate our capacity to deliver intelligent AI systems through the Prompt Fabricator service. Leveraging Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Chatbot, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and recommender models seamlessly and rapidly, our R.A.P.I.DTM platform facilitates this process effortlessly.

Arhasi proudly asserts its capability to quickly deliver integrated, secure, and governed AI assistants and systems through its R.A.P.I.DTM platform on Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and AWS. It also boasts integrations with Databricks, HPE Greenlake, and Snowflake’s Snowpark Container Services.

"In our commitment to enterprise social responsibility, we're proud to launch Prompt Fabricator, our fluid conversational agent, as a complimentary service for all. Our goal is to reduce the time needed to develop GenAI solutions." said Chiru Bhavansikar, Chief AI Officer at Arhasi.
