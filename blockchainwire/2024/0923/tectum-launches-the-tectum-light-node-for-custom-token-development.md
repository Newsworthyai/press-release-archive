# Tectum Launches the Tectum Light Node for Custom Token Development

Tectum, the fastest layer-1 blockchain, launches its Light Node - a tool for custom token development and management. The tech company had announced this product’s launch earlier while releasing its roadmap update.

Tectum’s Light Node promises to be a simplified and effective tool for developers to communicate with the fastest blockchain. Compared to full nodes, this is a more efficient method to transfer data on the decentralized network.

Tectum Light Node - Features of this Custom Token Development and Management ToolThe Tectum Light Node is a tool for custom token development and management. It enables developers to interact with the decentralized network efficiently. To utilize this service, devs must install the app from the company’s GitHub page.

Custom Token MintingDevelopers can mint custom tokens on the Tectum Light Node. The process begins with adding the necessary information as shown below:

* Token name
* Token symbol
* Total token amount
* Maximum decimal places
* Brief description of the token

Developers can create a custom token on the Tectum blockchain after entering the details above. The process requires Tectum Emission Tokens, and users can send TET to the public address below the balance.

Asset ManagementThe Light Node does not just store your digital assets on the platform. Instead, developers can transfer these custom tokens to every wallet compatible with the Tectum blockchain wallet.

These are the steps to manage your tokens on the Tectum Light Node:

* Create a new Tectum Light Node account
* Login to the account
* Navigate to “Custom Tokens”
* Input all the information in the description
* Pay $TET to mint new tokens.
* Send the custom tokens to an external wallet
* Track the custom tokens

Why Tectum Chose to Release a Light NodeDevelopers typically require full nodes to interact with a blockchain. However, Tectum chose to launch a Light Node for custom token development. The company’s spokesperson gave reasons why the intellectual property firm chose this approach.

In his words, a full node is resource-intensive and requires supercomputers. This is because using a node requires copying blockchain data, and a full node implies copying every blockchain record. This can run into 500 gigabytes of data, if not more.

With the Light Node, however, developers will not require the full blockchain record. Instead, they only have to copy the section of blockchain data they will interact with. In this case, this is the section that processes token transactions.

Instead of storing 500 gigabytes of data, users will only store 10 gigabytes of data or less.
