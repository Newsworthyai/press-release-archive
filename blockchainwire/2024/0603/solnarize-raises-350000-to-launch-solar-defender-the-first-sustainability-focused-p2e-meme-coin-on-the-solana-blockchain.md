Unveiling Solar Defender: Play, Protect, and Earn

This engaging P2E game educates players on renewable energy while offering a fun and rewarding experience. $SRIZE serves as the vital currency within the game, making it integral to the Solnarize ecosystem.

Significant Seed Funding Secured

Leading the charge is Sunivations Ventures, spearheading a $350,000 seed funding round with contributions from angel investors passionate about clean energy. Andzo Xemberzi, the team lead at Solnarize, expressed his excitement, saying, “This funding will accelerate the development of Solar Defender, which is set to launch this month, and will broaden our reach within the Solana community.”
