The WONDERS ([https://40wonders.wemix.com/](https://40wonders.wemix.com/)) are the Node Council Partners (NCPs) which validate transactions and blocks on the WEMIX3.0 mainnet, maintaining connections with newly added nodes to ensure the stable operation of the mainnet. Each new NCP, assigned a number between 1 and 40, plays a critical role in upholding the integrity and security of the WEMIX3.0 mainnet.FACTBLOCK is a Web3 ecosystem builder targeting the enhancement of industry health by effectively resolving information asymmetry in the blockchain sector. It also serves as a bridge connecting global blockchain enterprises with the Korean market and introducing domestic companies to the global stage. This year, FACTBLOCK plans to launch “Fablo,” a Web3 community educational platform dedicated to fostering community engagement by facilitating the exchange of knowledge on blockchain and supporting collective learning and development.

Since 2018, FACTBLOCK has been annually hosting Asia's largest blockchain conference, Korea Blockchain Week (KBW). Korea Blockchain Week serves as a hub for the birth of innovative businesses by inviting the industry's top global leaders and diverse communities. It has established itself as Asia's largest conference with participation from global opinion leaders, blockchain projects, and government agencies.

As it gains recognition as a global Web3 ecosystem builder, joining the 40 WONDERS will enable FACTBLOCK to contribute to the expansion of the WEMIX ecosystem and the invigoration of its community.
