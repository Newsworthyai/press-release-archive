The Tangem Ring makes hardware wallets more accessible and user-friendly than ever before. Users can now wear their crypto everywhere, enjoying instant access to over 6,000 assets and a range of services on their fingers. This innovation enhances the daily usability of cryptocurrencies and promotes secure habits by encouraging the use of hardware wallets over software alternatives or centralized exchanges.

Andrey Kurennykh, CEO and Co-founder of Tangem:

"Our goal with the Tangem Ring was to create a device that seamlessly integrates cryptocurrency management into users' daily lives. Tangem sets up new standards for the crypto wallet industry and opens the door to the future of crypto, which is easy, accessible, secure, and has a smooth and enjoyable customer experience."

Dubbed the future of crypto wallets, the Tangem Ring incorporates all the advanced features and shares the same technical characteristics as the Tangem Wallet. The ring has a CC EAL6+ certified chip, and an NFC antenna encased in a hypoallergenic zirconia ceramic shell. It is highly resistant to scratches, extreme temperatures, dust, and water, making it perfect for everyday usage.

Tangem Ring allows users to buy, sell, swap, stake, connect to decentralized applications, and access decentralized financeâ€”all their cryptocurrency needs in one ultimate, everyday device. This significantly reduces the barrier to entry for new users and drives wider adoption of cryptocurrencies.

The Tangem ring is now available for purchase through its official website. For more information about the Tangem Ring and its features, please visit the Tangem website.
