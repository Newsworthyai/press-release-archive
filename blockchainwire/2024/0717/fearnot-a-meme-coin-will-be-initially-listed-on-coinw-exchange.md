The Story and Sentiment behind “Fear Not”

In the wake of the assassination attempt on Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, there has been a significant rise in discussions and interest in Trump-themed meme coins. The FEARNOT token, which draws its name from one of Trump's social media post, "Fear Not" has become a symbol of resilience and unity among his supporters.

He said, “it was God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening" and vowed to "fear not" after surviving an assassination attempt as footage emerged of the gunman prior to the shooting.”

This sentiment has propelled the token to incredible heights, with a 300x increase since its launch on July 16, reaching a market cap of $30 million within just two days.

The FEARNOT token was created as a homage to Trump's message of fearlessness and solidarity. The slogan, prominently displayed on Trump's official website, resonates with many Americans who stand united against evil and adversity.
