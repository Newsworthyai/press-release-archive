# Boba Network Joins the Superchain Ecosystem, Benefiting from Cross-Chain Interoperability and Expanding Real-World Blockchain Applications

Boba Network, a multichain layer 2 known for its HybridCompute technology, has announced its integration into the Superchain ecosystem, a horizontally scalable network of chains. This integration strengthens Boba’s ability to support real-world applications while benefiting from enhanced cross-chain interoperability. The strategic move furthers Boba Network’s mission to deliver scalable and decentralized solutions for developers and users, extending its reach across multiple blockchains.

Boba Network’s integration opens the door to a previously inaccessible range of opportunities for decentralized applications (DApps) and real-world use cases. As an established and resilient L2 solution, Boba is built on the OP Stack and is designed to support intelligent hybrid applications through its proprietary HybridCompute technology.

“The Superchain supercharges Boba Network’s mission to be the home of intelligent hybrid applications that span use cases such as generative AI, DeFi, gaming, and real-world assets (RWA),” said Alan Chiu, CEO of Enya Labs, a core contributor to Boba Network. “We are excited to collaborate with the Optimism team to continue contributing to Boba Network and empowering developers with the resources they need to thrive on the network and in the Superchain ecosystem such as the Boba Liftoff Accelerator.”

The Superchain: Establishing Decentralized Scalability

The Superchain ecosystem is built on a collaborative framework designed to interconnect multiple L2 solutions, including Boba Network, in efforts to scale Ethereum and other blockchain networks. Superchain embodies a user-centric, secure, and decentralized design, setting out to create a unified network of scalable L2s that work in unison.

By joining the Superchain, Boba Network benefits from a more interconnected and cohesive blockchain ecosystem while providing its users with all its advantages, such as faster transaction times, improved security measures, and lower transaction costs.

“The Superchain ecosystem is home to visionary builders at the forefront of blockchain innovation, and we’re pleased to welcome Boba Network into the fold,” said Smit Vachhani, Business Development Lead at Optimism Unlimited. “Boba’s unique hybrid approach brings new potential for smarter applications and broader adoption, and we look forward to their growth on the OP Stack.”

Boba Network: Key Contributions

Boba Network brings several unique and innovative contributions to the Superchain ecosystem. Although Boba Network has not been a key contributor to the development of Erigon, it was the first L2 to implement Erigon as a sequencer client. This work attests to Boba’s long-established commitment to Ethereum’s core engineering principles.

Additionally, Boba Network developed and open-sourced a method for configuring L2 OP Stack chains to utilize custom gas tokens based on Optimism’s Custom Fee Token. This contribution ensures smooth cross-chain bridging and simplified token management across multiple L2 networks.

Superchain Integration: Key Benefits for Users and Developers

For users, Boba Network’s integration into the Superchain offers improved performance, reduced transaction costs, and more robust security thanks to the combined efforts of the Superchain’s decentralized security model.

For developers, Boba’s integration provides improved access and a wider offering of tools, resources, and support through the Superchain ecosystem. By accelerating development and innovation through the integration, projects already deployed on Boba Network, including Pyth, Symbiosis, and Oku Trade, will all benefit from Superchain’s infrastructure, with more exciting developments in the pipeline.

About Boba

Boba Network is an optimistic-based multichain layer-2 scaling solution that aims to unlock the potential of roll-up technology and enable more flexible blockchain communication. The protocol is fully compatible with EVM-based tools and has already deployed multichain support for Ethereum and BNB, supporting lightning-fast transactions and fees anywhere from 40-100X less than the respective layer-1. Boba Network is powered by HybridCompute™ technology that brings the power of Web2 on-chain, with smarter smart contracts that allow visionary developers to leverage off-chain compute and real-world data to build hybrid dApps that connect people to the future of blockchain applications.
