Investors are happy with this week as most cryptos surged during this period. Bitcoin climbed by an impressive 10%, and Ethereum followed suit with a 5% increase, signaling a strong bullish sentiment across the market. Amid these gains, Furrever Token has captured significant attention with its promise of up to 15X returns post-launch. As these developments unfold, the crypto community is abuzz with speculation on how the market will react to these exciting prospects.

Bitcoin Surged 10% in 7 Days: Optimism Amidst Market MomentumLast week proved remarkably optimistic for cryptocurrencies after a prolonged period of uncertainty. Despite higher-than-expected Producer Price Index (PPI) data, US inflation for April was reported lower, offering relief to risk markets previously jittery over fears of additional Fed interest rate hikes. Now, attention turns to upcoming data releases, particularly on employment and other economic indicators, until the June 12 meeting.

Labor market figures are weakening, while the latest wage growth data has been supportive for risk markets. Overall, with inflation figures gradually softening over the past few months, the likelihood of further Fed tightening and prolonged peak interest rates diminishes.

On the front of spot Bitcoin ETFs, this week's data has been supportive for Bitcoin. We're now seeing inflows rather than outflows in the GBTC space, pushing ETF total value above $12.4 billion. If we witness renewed inflows in IBIT and FBTC spaces totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, it could signal a more impressive resurgence akin to the rapid ascent witnessed until mid-March.

Ethereumâ€™s 5% Surge Caught Attention: Thrilling Market Outlook and Potential CatalystsEthereum (ETH) is presently valued at approximately $3,098.41, showing a slight decrease of 1.2% from yesterday while experiencing a notable increase of over 5% from the previous week. Despite Ethereum's recent performance, it has trailed behind Bitcoin throughout 2024, indicated by the ETH/BTC ratio hitting a three-year low of 0.044. However, following Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake (the Merge), its correlation with Bitcoin has witnessed a decline of 45%, diminishing the probability of the much-awaited "flippening."

Nevertheless, despite encountering hurdles, market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic. Analyst Michael van de Poppe suggests Ethereum is primed for an upward trajectory, particularly amidst adverse market conditions. Coinbase shares this positive outlook, emphasizing Ethereum's minimal supply-side pressures and the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF. Regulatory clarity, especially regarding the SEC's decision on the ETF, holds significant importance. While initial rejection is plausible, Coinbase contends that legal action could potentially reverse it.

The approval of a spot Ethereum ETF would signify a milestone, likely attracting increased institutional interest and investment in Ethereum, potentially elevating its price. The current ETH/BTC ratio, at a three-year low, indicates potential for growth should Ethereum narrow the gap with Bitcoin. Overall, market sentiment displays cautious optimism, with analysts anticipating Ethereum's resilience, particularly amidst potential regulatory advancements.
