* Initial Contact - Scammers initiate contact with potential victims online, often through social media platforms, dating apps, or text messages. They employ tactics such as sending "wrong number" texts or feigning romantic interest to establish rapport and gain trust.
* Building Trust - Once a connection is established, scammers invest time and effort into cultivating a relationship with the victim. They may shower them with affection, compliments, and promises of a prosperous future to create a sense of intimacy and dependency.
* Introduction to Cryptocurrency - Leveraging their position of trust, scammers introduce victims to cryptocurrency trading under the guise of lucrative investment opportunities. They tout insider knowledge, family connections, or special trading platforms to entice victims into making initial investments.
* Fraudulent Platforms - Victims are directed to fraudulent trading platforms or apps controlled by the scammers, where they are encouraged to deposit increasing amounts of money. The platforms may simulate trading activity to create the illusion of profitability and entice victims to invest.
* Financial Exploitation - As victims invest large sums of money, scammers use tactics to extract even more funds, such as imposing fictitious fees, taxes, or withdrawal restrictions. Victims may be coerced into borrowing money from friends and family or liquidating their assets to fuel their investments.
