In the rapidly evolving world of tech and finance, the demand for innovation and adaptability is higher than ever, driven by a quest for transparency for internet users. LunarCrush has been at the forefront of Social Intelligence, converting human-driven insights into actionable information for both retail and institutional stakeholders. Originally focusing on the crypto industry, LunarCrush's Social Intelligence now extends across diverse sectors such as technology, politics, travel, music, and more. Recognizing the convergence of crypto, the Internet, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), LunarCrush is making a significant leap forward in their transparency efforts through social intelligence. By launching the Social Intelligence Paranet on the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), LunarCrush aims to enhance content collection through incentivized crowdsourcing and enable the creation of AI-powered services on this trusted knowledge base.

The Decentralized Knowledge Graph and the Social Intelligence Paranet

The Social Intelligence Paranet will operate on the OriginTrail DKG, a permissionless peer-to-peer network that ensures all social content published to the Paranet is discoverable, verifiable, and attributed to its owners. This setup allows AI services leveraging this knowledge base to avoid challenges like hallucinations, managed bias, and intellectual property violations. For an in-depth understanding of the technical design of paranets, DKG, and decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (dRAG), we recommend reviewing the OriginTrail Whitepaper.

The Social Intelligence Paranet Initiative

Aligned with LunarCrush’s growth trajectory, the Social Intelligence Paranet will initially target the crypto sector, attracting high-quality content creators and community members from various crypto projects. LunarCrush will also mine knowledge tied to their social insights, such as Alt Rank, Top Creators, and Sentiment analysis. Beyond knowledge mining, the Social Intelligence Paranet will feature the first AI-powered tool to interact with top knowledge assets on the Paranet, supported by LunarCrush. This AI-powered tool will be accessible to users paying with BUZ tokens. All BUZ tokens spent by users will be recycled as additional rewards for knowledge mining.In the upcoming weeks, a comprehensive proposal for the Social Intelligence Paranet will be submitted to the NeuroWeb community for approval. The proposal will include:

- Knowledge Assets created from LunarCrush APIs

- An incentives model for knowledge miners targeting the first category of knowledge

- A demo of the LunarCrush AI tool

Advancing the Wisdom of the Crowds

The traditional wisdom of the crowds concept eliminates idiosyncratic noise associated with individual judgment by averaging a large number of responses. Social Intelligence takes this concept further by unlocking actionable information through high-quality, curated knowledge enhanced with specific domain expertise. The rise of AI introduces the potential for another leap forward in extracting wisdom from a vast body of knowledge. Incentivized crowdsourcing to collect superior social content provides an ideal foundation for AI services to uncover wisdom that is not immediately apparent. While a conversational tool is the initial step, subsequent developments will include AI agents performing comprehensive tasks such as market analysis and prediction market suggestions. As the Social Intelligence Paranet expands beyond the crypto field, it promises to support enhanced decision-making powered by the wisdom of the crowds across various topics.
