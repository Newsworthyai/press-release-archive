# Going Global: How BlockDAG Network Landed On the Screens of London (and Listed on Coinmarketcap)

There’s a lot to celebrate in cryptocurrency today. Bitcoin seems to be slowly but surely shooting for that $100,000 mark and BlockDAG Network is taking over the world–quite literally.

Like never before, many people think that investing in cryptocurrencies is an excellent alteration to diversify their investment portfolio. Because traditional communication channels have failed in the past to have a dramatic impact on the general public, Blockchain technology or crypto projects like BlockDAG Network are acutely aware that awe-inspiring digital marketing is necessary to promote and accelerate innovation and adoption.

According to Statista, it is essential for a new market participant to create a positive image and stand out among the sea of cryptocurrencies already in existence. The masses rely heavily on brand and company advertisement. This connection allows them to get to know projects on a more personal level and choose whether they want to be active participants in the ecosystems.

Projects that choose to be professional participants in the cryptocurrency market must analyse their brand reputation, foster credibility, create excitement and share as much accurate information as possible with their audience.

Blockchain and cryptocurrencies represent a new reality of economic aspects that are technically different from existing traditional systems. Unlike conventional financial institutions or service providers, blockchain ecosystem professionals use and maximise participation in events, digital marketing, public relations, and media exposure to build and support their crypto businesses, blockchain, and DeFi projects. They try to attract or keep participants through an array of “modern marketing” efforts.

Marketing and advertising have become indispensable tools for projects aiming to carve out their niche and gain traction in a crowded market. In a space where innovation and competition abound, effective marketing strategies can make all the difference in capturing the attention of investors, attracting users, and establishing credibility. The power of good publicity and the “ripple effects” of spreading word-of-mouth through social media cannot be understated. Projects that successfully leverage these channels to showcase their strengths, highlight their value propositions, and engage with their community often see exponential growth and recognition within the industry.

BlockDAG Network is a project that has truly embraced the importance of marketing and advertisement in its journey to becoming a household name in the cryptocurrency world.

Through monumental marketing efforts, BlockDAG Network has embarked on a mission to "go global" and take over the world, one major city at a time. From the bustling streets of Tokyo to the iconic skyline of New York City, BlockDAG's presence has been felt far and wide. And today, the project stands illuminated on the screens of Piccadilly Circus, marking yet another milestone in its unstoppable ascent.

The significance of BlockDAG's global marketing endeavours is truly fascinating. By capturing the attention of audiences in key financial hubs and cultural epicentres, BlockDAG is attracting an ever-growing, more diverse user base and global audience. The project's commitment to visibility and accessibility is evident in its strategic approach to marketing, which leverages both traditional advertising channels and the power of social media to amplify its message and reach.

Indeed, the recent listing of BlockDAG Network on Coinmarketcap is a testament to the project's rising prominence and credibility within the cryptocurrency community. As one of the most important and widely-used cryptocurrency websites in the world, Coinmarketcap listing provides affirmation and validation of BlockDAG's legitimacy and potential legacy. It opens doors to new opportunities, increases visibility, and instils confidence among investors and stakeholders.

Looking ahead, the future of BlockDAG Network is brighter than ever–both metaphorically and because of the bright lights of the screens of Piccadilly Circus.

While Bitcoin is slowly but surely pointing at hitting the $100K mark this coming September, BlockDAG Network’s innovative strategic marketing initiatives, and growing liquidity will surely propel the project to new heights in the coming months, with exponential growth and global success.
