In the midst of Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing declines, Furrever Token emerges with an enticing proposition: a limited-time $20,000 giveaway. This offer presents a unique opportunity for investors seeking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on potential gains. As the crypto market experiences turbulence, Furrever Token's giveaway stands out as a beacon of opportunity, offering participants the chance to win substantial rewards while the industry giants face downward trends.

Bitcoin Social Activity Declines Amid Market VolatilityBitcoin (BTC) is currently priced at around $60,991.88, reflecting a 2.3% decrease from yesterday's rates. Recent data reveals that Bitcoin has experienced a notable decline in social activity, marking its lowest level of engagement this year. Despite this downturn, Bitcoin maintains a significant presence in discussions within the crypto space, indicating ongoing engagement and participation.

The decrease in social activity surrounding Bitcoin is attributed to its recent struggles to maintain the $61,000 price range. Social metrics, however, show that Bitcoin continues to dominate discussions within the cryptocurrency space. BTC's Social Dominance remains within the 26% range, with a slight shift from 26.21% to 26.42%. The Social Volume on May 8th concluded with a count of 4,622, suggesting that Bitcoin maintains a substantial presence in cryptocurrency discussions despite the reported decline in social activity.

Additionally, Bitcoin's 24-hour active addresses chart indicates a recent decline compared to activity levels observed earlier in the month and the previous month. Nonetheless, with around 721,000 active addresses as of this writing, Bitcoin continues to demonstrate significant activity on its network despite the recent market dip.

Ethereum Faces Regulatory Hurdles: It Is Still DecliningEthereum (ETH) is currently priced at around $2,971.87, maintaining stability with a slight downturn from yesterday's prices. However, regulatory challenges loom large for the popular cryptocurrency. On May 6, 2024, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced a delay in its decision regarding the proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF. This delay underscores the uncertainty surrounding the approval of spot Ether ETFs, as the SEC persists in viewing Ethereum as a security.

Despite resistance from entities like Consensys, which argues Ethereum's classification as a global computing platform akin to commodities like Bitcoin and Gold, the SEC remains firm in its stance. John Reed Stark, a senior law lecturer and former chief of Internet Enforcement at the SEC, emphasized the regulatory body's commitment to protecting crypto investors from predatory practices during his testimony before the US House of Representatives Financial Service Committee.

Amidst speculation surrounding Ethereum's price action, the cryptocurrency has rebounded approximately 3 percent in the past week, trading around $3,070 on Monday. However, Ethereum faces a technical challenge as it aims for an all-time high (ATH) in the coming weeks, contingent upon consistently closing above $3,380. Additionally, the daily 50 MA serves as a formidable resistance level, adding complexity to Ethereum's price trajectory amidst regulatory uncertainties.
