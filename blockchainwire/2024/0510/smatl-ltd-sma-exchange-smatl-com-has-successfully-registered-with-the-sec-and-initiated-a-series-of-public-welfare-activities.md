SMA's team has gathered outstanding blockchain technology talents from around the world, with core members having previously worked in globally renowned financial technology companies. Its business covers more than 30 countries, establishing a good reputation in multiple countries by creating innovative products, exploring new trading methods, and providing high-quality services.

To fulfill its social responsibilities, SMA has also carried out the following public welfare activities:

- SMA funds research projects in the blockchain and AI fields on campuses, supporting technological innovation and development, and contributing to the industry's development.

- SMA supports environmental initiatives, actively participating in activities to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, contributing to environmental protection.

SMA announced that it will donate a portion of its revenue to charitable organizations to support various social welfare causes, helping improve social welfare and promote social equity.

The core of SMA's trading system lies in its ability to analyze and process data. Through technologies such as machine learning and deep learning, SMA's trading system can continuously learn and optimize trading strategies, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of trading. This system can automatically execute trades or operate according to predefined rules, reducing the impact of human factors on trading decisions, and improving the stability and consistency of trading.

SMA's AI intelligent trading system can acquire and analyze a large amount of market data in an automated manner, thus better grasping market changes. This system can monitor market dynamics in real time, identify potential trading opportunities, and respond promptly. Compared with traditional manual trading, AI intelligent trading systems have faster decision-making speeds and a wider range of information acquisition, thereby better grasping market changes.

Due to its advocacy for AI, the company actively participates in promoting the informatization process of impoverished areas. SMA provides electronic equipment to support financial inclusion projects in impoverished areas, such as laptops and smartphones, and provides technical support to enable local residents to access online financial and other network resources. This helps those who cannot access traditional financial services, promoting financial inclusion and sustainable development.

This initiative not only helps residents in impoverished areas integrate into the information society but also provides them with opportunities to learn about AI and blockchain. At the same time, SMA has also conducted a series of digital literacy training activities to improve their information literacy. These initiatives aim to promote AI and financial inclusion, allowing more people to benefit from the convenience and opportunities brought by AI and blockchain, and contribute to the construction of an information society.

SMA hopes to fulfill its social responsibilities through these public welfare activities, contribute to the development of the industry, and benefit more people.
