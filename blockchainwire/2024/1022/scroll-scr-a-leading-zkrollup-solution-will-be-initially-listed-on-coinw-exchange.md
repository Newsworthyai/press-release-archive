Scroll's Innovative Approach to Ethereum ScalingLaunched in 2023, Scroll has rapidly established itself as a key player in Ethereum scaling solutions, leveraging zkEVM architecture to achieve seamless EVM compatibility. In 2024, Scroll became a dominant force in the EAS-proof rankings, surpassing other leading chains like Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon. Collaborating with the Ethereum Foundation’s zk team, Scroll employs the advanced Halo2 proof system to build the first zkEVM in a fully open environment, complemented by its proprietary GPU zkEVM prover, which is 10 times faster than traditional CPU provers. Through the launch of ZK hardware accelerator, PipeZK, Scroll is further pioneering the ZK hardware market.

SCR Token: Utility and TokenomicsThe SCR token is at the heart of Scroll’s ecosystem, serving as both a governance and utility token. From the first day of listing, SCR holders will have the ability to participate in governance decisions related to Scroll's protocol development. Future use cases include staking, gas-free transactions, and coordinating incentives across the network. With a total supply of 1 billion SCR tokens, the initial circulating supply at launch will be 190 million. The token allocation is designed to ensure long-term growth, with a focus on ecosystem development, investor incentives, and community participation through airdrops.

A Strong Ecosystem Backed by Substantial FundingScroll’s ecosystem has seen rapid expansion, with a DeFi TVL reaching $1.15 billion in September 2024 and a stablecoin market cap exceeding $100 million—leading the ZK chain space. Major DeFi projects like Pencil Protocol, Tokan Exchange, and Rho Markets have joined Scroll's vibrant ecosystem. Supported by over $80 million in funding and a $1.8 billion valuation, Scroll’s future is bright as users gradually transition from Optimistic Rollups to zkRollups, securing its position as a major Layer 2 hub.
