# DKGcon 2024: Breaking down trust and reliability barriers of artificial intelligence

Web3, artificial intelligence (AI), and Internet innovators and builders will gather at the Decentralized Knowledge Graph Conference (DKGcon) 2024 on October 24 and 25 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. With the increasing use of generative AI (genAI) technologies in business and our everyday lives, the need for reliable, verifiable, and sustainable AI solutions is evident. This year’s second edition of DKGcon under the title AI Meets Reliability will address how to drive trust in AI with decentralized technologies of Web3, such as blockchain, and knowledge graphs, a technology that was until recently primarily used by Internet giants such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook.

Meet the Internet, Web3, and AI pioneersOrganized under the auspices of the open-source OriginTrail ecosystem, DKGcon will gather some of the leading global minds working at the intersection of the Internet, blockchain, large language models (LLMs), and knowledge graphs. They will be discussing and showcasing how to use these technologies to build and use the verifiable Internet for AI - an Internet where the users can harness the benefits of AI advancements and at the same time curb the anomalies AI is currently showing, such as hallucinations, bias, issues with data privacy and ownership, and even model collapse.

Some of the leading global minds working at the intersection of the Internet, blockchain, large language models (LLMs), and knowledge graphs will be speaking at DKGcon 2024.

Among the speakers at the conference will be:

- The Internet pioneer and inventor of Ethernet Dr. Bob Metcalfe,- Dr. Ben Goertzel, CEO of SingularityNET and Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, who helped popularize the term artificial general intelligence (AGI),- Gary Marcus, a cognitive scientist, neuro-symbolic AI expert, best-selling author, serial entrepreneur, and a leading voice in AI,- Branimir Rakić,the founder and CTO of OriginTrail and the main architect of the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG).

Convergence of blockchain, AI, and the Internet to create more reliable and verifiable AI solutionsThe convergence of blockchain, AI, and Internet technologies is a novel approach to making AI technologies safer and more reliable that is already showing promising results. At DKGcon, the developers and users of these technologies will showcase and discuss how the technologies are reshaping industries from supply chains, creative industries, start-up ecosystems, and scientific research, to online networking, virtual ecosystems in the metaverse, and beyond.

The participants will be learning from presenters from established organizations such as Google, Microsoft, AWS, the British Standards Institution (BSI), GS1, and McGill University, as well as from trailblazers from up-and-coming organizations such as Trace Labs - Origintrail Core Developers, the Web3 Foundation, ID Theory, Theta Labs, CanvasLand Technology, Skyocean, Lunar Crush, Datalatte, and others. For those interested in practical experience with building and using a combination of blockchain, AI, and Internet technologies, workshops on October 25 will offer the opportunity to learn how to use and build with the open-source OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG).
