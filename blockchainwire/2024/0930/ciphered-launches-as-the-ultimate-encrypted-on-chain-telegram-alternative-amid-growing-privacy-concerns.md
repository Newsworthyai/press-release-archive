# Ciphered Launches as the Ultimate Encrypted, On-Chain Telegram Alternative Amid Growing Privacy Concerns

The world of digital communication is witnessing a groundbreaking transformation with the launch of Ciphered, a decentralized and encrypted messaging app that addresses growing concerns around privacy and data security. Built on Ethereum and designed to be the secure alternative to traditional messaging platforms, Ciphered offers a robust, on-chain solution for encrypted conversations, ensuring user data is always protected.

A Timely Response to Telegram's Privacy Policy Changes

The launch of Ciphered comes at a critical juncture for the messaging community. Telegram's recent announcement regarding changes to its Terms of Service (TOS)—which now include sharing users’ IP addresses and phone numbers with authorities—has sparked widespread outrage. This alarming shift in privacy policy has left users scrambling for safer alternatives.

As a direct response to this uproar, Ciphered was developed to offer users a privacy-first platform that prioritizes end-to-end encryption and decentralized control. Unlike Telegram, Ciphered does not store, share, or expose any user data, including phone numbers or IP addresses, ensuring that your private conversations remain just that—private.

Ciphered aims to be more than just another encrypted messaging app; it is an ecosystem designed to evolve and enhance user experience through the power of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI). Whether you're a casual user or a community manager, Ciphered's rich suite of features will revolutionize how you communicate in the digital age.

"Our goal with Ciphered is to provide a truly secure, user-friendly platform for communication that’s immune to censorship or surveillance. The integration of blockchain and AI allows us to build a future-proof app where privacy and security come first," said a spokesperson for Ciphered.

End-to-End Encryption with AI-Powered Enhancements

At the heart of Ciphered’s design lies a commitment to protecting users' data. Encryption is paramount, ensuring that no third party—whether a government entity, hacker, or service provider—can access users' private communications. By utilizing the Ethereum blockchain, Ciphered ensures all messages are on-chain and completely immutable, making the platform immune to external tampering or shutdowns.

The integration of artificial intelligence enhances not only the app’s security measures but also its user experience. Ciphered’s AI features allow for:

1. Automated Customer Support: Ciphered’s AI ensures that users can access seamless support 24/7, reducing response times and improving user satisfaction.
