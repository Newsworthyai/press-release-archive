# Binance lists two NEIRO tokens as the meme space anticipates the launch of Neirochain

Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you may have noticed that two Neiro tokens were listed on Binance this week. It’s the first time a T1 exchange has ever listed two of the same token, and over the last couple months since the passing of the original DOGE, Kabosu and the announcement from the Sato family that they adopted a new family member the sister of Dogs, Neiro, inspiring the conception of Neirochain to carry on the spirit of Kabosu through his family.

Many in the novel blockchain tech space may remember the popularity of Dogechain. Now, meme communities anticipate the launch of Neirochain, with a variety of things to look forward to such as near gasless trading, huge grant schemes and cash injections into live meme markets as well as a pump fun style launchpad available on launch (Neiros.meme).

A countdown to the launch of Neirochain confirms that they plan to release the token, alongside the chain on September 19th. The website suggests a 12pm EST launch time, but this remains unconfirmed throughout our conversations with the team. It’s worth noting, you can already explore the blockchain and add it to your Metamask. As the bridge isn’t live yet though, you can’t use Neiros.meme or trade any live markets until that’s enabled.

Neirochain comes after the phenomenal success of a completely community owned token, setting the standard for what we want in our space. Neiros.meme will make it near costless to mint a meme, and the team is putting a focus on cash injections into new markets as well as connecting new and prospective developers with the best services and incubators in the industry, to create a different quality of tokens on the chain. The Neirochain Foundation claims inspiration from Justin Sun’s Sunpump and execution of memes on Tron, and as a blockchain they want to replicate that success and redistribute it to the community.

With so many platforms and extensive documentation, the Neirochain Foundation has put together a handy linktree where you can find everything you need regarding the $NC launch and new chain:
