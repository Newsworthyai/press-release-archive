About Circular Protocol

The Circular Protocol, a visionary project in the blockchain space, was conceived to address critical issues in the healthcare sector through innovative data auditing technologies. In 2024, a significant portion of the global population still faces challenges in accessing quality medical services, especially in economically disadvantaged regions. The Circular Protocol aims to mitigate instances of medical malpractice by ensuring transparent, tamper-proof medical records and clinical trial data, thereby protecting patients and enhancing trust in healthcare systems.

The Circular Protocol leverages blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent platform for managing medical records and clinical data. By employing both public and private blockchains, the protocol accommodates privacy concerns and ensures compliance with diverse regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA. This dual approach not only safeguards sensitive medical information but also allows for the necessary legal and temporal persistence of data, addressing the complex needs of the healthcare industry.

At the core of the Circular Protocol is a next-generation multi-chain Layer 1 blockchain designed to meet the stringent regulatory standards of the healthcare sector while remaining adaptable to other industries such as DeFi and GameFi. The protocol's innovative architecture includes features like auto-progressive sharding, decentralized storage gateways, and a reputation-based consensus mechanism. These advancements ensure scalability, security, and decentralization, positioning the Circular Protocol as a robust and versatile solution in the blockchain ecosystem. The upcoming listing of CIRX on XT marks a pivotal step in expanding the reach and impact of this groundbreaking project.
