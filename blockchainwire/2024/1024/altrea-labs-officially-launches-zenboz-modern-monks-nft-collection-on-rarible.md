# Altrea Labs Officially Launches Zenboz Modern Monks NFT Collection on Rarible

The wait is over: the team at Altrea Labs has officially launched its innovative NFT collection, Zenboz Modern Monks on the Base blockchain, available for minting now on Rarible. This new project merges art and AI tech unlike anything seen before in the NFT space.
