# Bety Unveils Enhanced Offer of 20,000+ Crypto Games and Sportsbook Events

Bety, one of the leading Web3 betting platforms with a decentralized approach to casinos and sportsbooks, has unveiled its enhanced offer, boasting over 20,000 crypto casino games, sports, and eSports events. The platform aims to become one of the top Bitcoin casinos with a fair, transparent, and unmatched gaming experience for everyone.Blockchain technology is a catalyst for innovation in all sectors, and online casino gaming is no exception. The growing adoption of cryptocurrency into the mainstream supports the emergence of groundbreaking platforms in digital entertainment. Bety is one of the major players spearheading this revolution by offering secure and accessible gaming experiences to change how people interact with online gambling services.

The Advantages of Web3 BettingTraditional online casinos have been around since the early days of the Internet. However, they have always faced the same challenges, such as slow payouts and high deposit/withdrawal fees. Moreover, users have often complained about the improvable fairness of game bets and their outcomes.

Web3 betting solves these issues and takes online casino gaming to the next level through blockchain gaming. Its use of decentralized ledger technology ensures a transparent gaming experience for all users. It also accelerates deposit and withdrawal times at considerably lower costs than what traditional casinos practice.

The processing times for deposits at traditional and crypto casinos are similar, often occurring instantly. However, there is a significant difference in withdrawal times between conventional online casinos and blockchain-based casinos.

For example, traditional casinos can take several days to process withdrawals. Users often have to wait up to 3 days to transfer winnings to their credit/debit cards and 7 days via bank transfers. On the other hand, crypto casinos process payouts in only a few minutes, sometimes instantly, depending on the blockchain network’s congestion. This remarkable speed allows players to access their earnings faster and enhances the user experience.

The Rise of Blockchain GamingBlockchain gaming is a game-changer for the online casino experience. This technology offers unprecedented levels of trust and transparency. Thanks to its decentralized nature, players from various regions can play in complete anonymity and privacy. Furthermore, the lack of a centralized authority enhances game insights. It sets the stage for provably fair game mechanics, thus empowering players to make informed choices.

Bety is an innovative blockchain gaming platform that employs the Provable Fairness concept, which is fundamental for Web3 betting. The platform ensures that game outcomes are determined randomly and cannot be manipulated by the operator or any other party. Therefore, Bety guarantees equal winning odds for all players.

Innovation and AccessibilityBety stands out as a popular crypto casino with a rich selection of classic casino games and sports events catering to high-end players. The platform excels through its user-centered approach, which includes various bonuses, an exclusive VIP program, and 24/7 customer support.

Moreover, Bety embraces the latest technological advances by incorporating the many benefits of blockchain networks, such as Bitcoin payments. The platform supports quick Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals, offering higher privacy and accessibility than traditional payment methods, such as debit or credit cards.

Hash Games at Bety CasinoBlockchain technology increases the gaming offer for online casinos, providing games not supported by traditional casinos. For example, conventional casinos rely on the classic offer of vintage games with limited scalability and versatility potential. On the other hand, blockchain provides a fertile ground for boundless creativity, spurring innovative concepts, such as play-to-earn and hold-to-earn.

Gaming diversity is one of the most exciting aspects of building a Web3 betting platform on blockchain technology. In addition to offering traditional casino games such as slots, poker, blackjack, and roulette, Web3 casinos also provide hash games.

Hash games are fast-paced, simple games that mimic classic casino games while adding a pinch of excitement. The game mechanics use hash value calculation and blockchain algorithms to deliver a thrilling, straightforward gaming experience. Players must wager on a predicted hash interval and win if their prediction is correct. Hash games involve various betting options that broaden the winning odds.

Bety has several hash games in its versatile blockchain gaming offer, including Hash Banker Player, Hash Bull, 3-Min Bull, 1-Min Banker Player, and more. These games function by simple, easy-to-understand rules and ensure provable fair outcomes with appealing RTP rates.
