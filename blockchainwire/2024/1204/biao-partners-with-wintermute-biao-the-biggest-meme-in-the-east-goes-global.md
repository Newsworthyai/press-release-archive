# BIAO Partners with Wintermute: $BIAO - The Biggest Meme in the East Goes Global!

In the crypto world, where narratives shape markets and cultural relevance fuels growth, meme coins have carved out a unique niche. While $PEPE reigns as the largest meme coin in the West, with a staggering valuation of $10 billion, the East has its own contender: $BIAO. Currently valued at just $20 million, $BIAO holds the potential to not only bridge this valuation gap but also become a global sensation.![](https://blockchainwire.s3.amazonaws.com/ff8d21fb-883f-668c-ad2e-2252b09fac2a/editor_image/cdc19d1c-f165-4a14-8ba2-50797e9687a9.jpg)

The Rise of Media-Driven CoinsCrypto markets often thrive on media-driven narratives. We’ve seen it before with $PEPE’s meteoric rise, fueled by online hype and cultural resonance. Stocks like GameStop ($GME) surged in Q2 due to media attention, and other tokens have followed similar trajectories. The success formula is clear: when media and social platforms converge, they create a frenzy of speculation and investment.Why $BIAO Stands Out$BIAO isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a cultural phenomenon in the East, mirroring $PEPE’s role in the West. With a strong narrative foundation as “China’s Pepe,” $BIAO is uniquely positioned to capitalize on both cultural identity and global market trends.Moreover, speculation about China’s shifting stance on cryptocurrency has dominated conversations throughout 2024. Over the past two weeks, China has made significant moves, including unbanning various technologies and recently cutting crypto taxes for hedge funds. These developments suggest a warming attitude toward crypto, with many anticipating a full unbanning in Q4.The Opportunity AheadWhen China officially embraces crypto, the resulting media coverage is expected to flood crypto-focused social platforms and news outlets. This will likely spark massive FOMO (fear of missing out) among investors, especially for tokens with strong ties to Chinese culture. $BIAO, as the region’s premier meme coin, could become a focal point of this movement.With a population of over 3 billion in the East, the potential for $BIAO is monumental. Investors are essentially front-running a wave of interest that could see $BIAO achieve valuations reminiscent of $PEPE’s success.AnnouncementWe are thrilled to announce that BIAO has officially partnered with Wintermute, a leading global market maker in the cryptocurrency industry.
