# Independent Presidential Candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Joins Consensus as a Headline Speaker

In less than four weeks, independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will take the stage in Austin, TX, at Consensus 2024, the world's largest, longest-running, and most influential gathering that brings together all sides of the crypto and Web3 community. As an environmental lawyer, scion of a Democratic political dynasty, and now maverick presidential candidate, Kennedy will explain his support for cryptocurrency and self-custody.

“I’m looking forward to speaking later this month at Consensus 2024. I am determined to keep America the world leader in blockchain innovation,” Kennedy said. “We can’t allow hostile regulators to drive this technology abroad.”

Mr. Kennedy has been a vocal supporter of cryptocurrencies, highlighting their potential to help the middle class and protect transactional freedom to Americans. He has recently proposed putting the entire U.S. budget on the blockchain to enable every American to access and scrutinize budget items around the clock. His stance on cryptocurrencies has positioned him as a distinctive and forward-thinking voice in crypto.

Other influential U.S. policy leaders speaking at Consensus 2024 include:

1. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR)
2. Under Secretary of the Treasury Brian Nelson
3. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, (D-IL)
4. Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN)
5. CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger
6. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN)
7. SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce
