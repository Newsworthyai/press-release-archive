# Biptap is Set to Disrupt the Financial Industry After 2 Million Funding

Biptap, one of the fastest-growing fintech companies, specializing in privacy-centric offshore banking solutions, today announced it has raised $2 million in a pre-seed funding round. The round attracted prominent investors, including multiple web3 decentralized investment funds, a travel facilitator with a 2.5 million hotel network, an encryption tech firm formerly owning a MotoGP Racing team, and the ex-founder of a major crypto investment fund. This funding marks a significant milestone for Biptap as it aims to transform the financial landscape with its unique approach to privacy and control.

Founded in 2022 by web3 advocate Jonathan Low, Biptap’s mission is to return financial power to the people. While the company’s primary focus is on delivering privacy-first banking solutions accessible to everyone, it also embraces the principles of decentralization inherent in Web3 technologies.

Empowering Privacy in Financial TransactionsBiptap’s flagship offering is a privacy-first banking solution for individuals and businesses. It enables users globally to manage their finances in a decentralized environment, reflecting Biptap’s belief that privacy should be a fundamental right.

Strategic Growth and Product DevelopmentThe recent $2 million funding will enable Biptap to broaden its market presence, extend its reach, and enhance its product offerings.
