About One4kids:

One4kids, a pioneering ethical and morally based educational media company for young children in Sydney, Australia, began in 2006. Their main productions with Zaky & Friends were produced to fill a void for quality educational entertainment for Muslim children in mainstream entertainment. The company started from a simple idea and has now reached audiences throughout Australia and around the world from Southeast Asia, the USA, Europe, South Africa, and Nigeria to countries in the Middle East with limited marketing budgets.

One4kids Founder - Subi Alshaik:

Sydney film producer Subi Alshaik is a former musician who has dedicated the past 24 years to making a difference in the lives of young children. Mr. Alshaik script writes, directs, voices characters and produces all material with the help of a small team of dedicated employees. As a parent, Mr. Alshaik found a lack of entertainment for children that teach good ethical values at a young age. This was Mr Alshaik's motivation, and thus, the creation of Zaky & Friends began. One4Kids is there to help children grow through educational entertainment and positive role models, such as Zaky.
