# BLAST HOGE Token Takes the DeFi World by Storm on the Blast Network, Surpasses $3M Market Cap in Just 3 Days

In a monumental display of community engagement and rapid growth, the BLAST HOGE ($HOGE) token launched on the BlasterSwap decentralized exchange (DEX) on May 17th, 2024, achieving a market cap of over $3M after only three days of trading on the Blast network. This milestone marks a significant achievement for the HOGE Finance ecosystem and highlights the potential for Layer 1 Ethereum communities transitioning to Layer 2 solutions.

A Historic Launch on BlasterSwap

BLAST HOGE began with an initial liquidity of $50,000 on BlasterSwap, a DEX with over $17 million in total value locked (TVL). The token quickly attracted enthusiastic support, reaching $2 million in TVL and surpassing $60,000 in first-day trading volume. This rapid growth underscores the token's robust appeal and the community's strong trust in its vision.

Empowering The HOGE Community through Airdrops

A key element of the launch was the extensive HOGE Finance airdrop. Over 75 billion tokens were distributed to HOGE holders on Ethereum, with each of the 76,000+ wallets receiving just over 1 million tokens totaling 20% of the supply. This airdrop incentivizes engagement with Layer 2 solutions, enabling immediate exploration of dApps on the BLAST network at no expense to existing HOGE Finance community members. Upcoming partnerships promise to further enhance the tokenâ€™s utility.An additional 10% of the total token supply (valued at $122,000 at time of writing) has been distributed to the HOGE Finance DAO treasury wallet via industry-leading token management partners. These funds will bolster the community treasury and add everlasting value to the wider HOGE Finance ecosystem by funding new initiatives and proposals, as well as providing liquidity for a myriad of potential developments.

The Blast Network, boasting over $1.5 billion in TVL, is preparing for an anticipated airdrop on June 27th, estimated to be near or above $1 billion in value.
