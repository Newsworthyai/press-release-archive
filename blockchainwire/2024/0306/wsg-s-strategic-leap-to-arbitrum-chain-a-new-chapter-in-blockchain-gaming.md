New York, NY - February 23, 2024 - Wall Street Games (WSG), the pioneering hybrid blockchain-based gaming platform, proudly announces its strategic migration to Arbitrum Chain (ARB). This strategic move signifies a significant evolution for WSG, introducing enhanced features and a dynamic new token ecosystem while cementing its position as a leader in the blockchain gaming industry.

The Big WSG Revamp: Elevating the Gaming Experience

In response to the evolving needs of its community, WSG has undergone a significant transformation, introducing a range of innovative features and a dynamic new token ecosystem. From multiplayer functionality and the introduction of Gold as an in-game currency to a comprehensive transition plan for existing token holders, WSG is committed to delivering an unparalleled gaming experience while fostering growth and sustainability within its ecosystem.

1. Multiplayer Functionality and Gold: WSG introduces multiplayer functionality and a new in-game currency, Gold, enhancing interactive gaming experiences. Players can now create and join lobbies, wager Gold, and compete against opponents, adding a thrilling competitive edge to every duel. Privacy options ensure a personalized gaming experience, with private matches allowing players to engage with friends or selected opponents.
2. Transition to Arbitrum L2: WSG has successfully transitioned to the Arbitrum L2 chain, accompanied by the launch of a new token designed to leverage the enhanced efficiency and scalability of Arbitrum. This transition represents a pivotal moment in WSG's journey toward sustainable growth and innovation. The new token's tokenomics have been meticulously crafted to foster a balanced ecosystem, with allocations dedicated to airdrops, liquidity, rewards & staking, marketing, team development, advisors, and over-the-counter deals.
3. Comprehensive Transition Plan: WSG has developed a comprehensive plan to ensure a seamless transition for current token holders. An airdrop allocation is available for old token holders, with immediate release and vesting mechanisms in place. Additionally, staking pools (single asset and a LP staking pool) will be transitioned to the new Arbitrum L2 chain, with adjustments made to locking periods of the single asset staking pool.
4. Website Revamp & Platform Changes: WSG unveils a revamped website with enhanced features, including Gold and WSG exchange, integrated chest feature, updated staking mechanisms, and a refreshed inventory interface, among others. These changes are aimed at improving user experience and providing players with more opportunities to engage with the platform.
