# BABA, the most exclusive MEME on Solana.

Introduction:BABA is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain, having emerged just since 3rd of February 2024. It underwent a stealth launch, starting with a market cap of 3K. The storyline revolves around BABA, who, feeling neglected by his brother PEPE, witnesses PEPE’s success and wealth, leading BABA to adopt an unhealthy lifestyle, becoming overweight and depressed. Tired of this, BABA resolves to surpass his brother in the crypto world, promising success, significant gains for followers, and a commitment to achieving the best shape in the crypto space.BABA’s complete team has undergone KYC verification at SolidProof (https://t.me/solidproof/2464). Comprising two owners, BABA I and BABA II, supported by four additional team members, each serves a specific role in the project, spanning development, content creation, and community management. The two developers boast significant crypto experience, with one having 9 years and the other 13 years, evident in our work.Presently, the project concentrates on community building and marketing efforts. BABA undergoes a transformation at each market cap milestone (1M, 10M, 100M, 1B), reflecting improvements in its form and strength. Marketing and development efforts escalate with each milestone.Tokenomics:BABA’s tokenomics feature a 0% tax rate, with the team holding tokens, known to SolidProof. These tokens are allocated for marketing, contests, CEX listings, etc. The decision for a 0% tax is aligned with the current trend on SOL, aiming to maximize potential recognition as a meme coin.Vision:As BABA Developers, we have diligently examined numerous projects within the space, gathering comprehensive information. Over the course of several weeks, we engaged in extensive brainstorming sessions to conceptualize the ideal MEME for the imminent bull run, during which the total cryptocurrency market capitalization is projected to reach unprecedented levels. Anticipating the influx of trillions into the market, our objective is to attract a substantial share to BABA. We aim to achieve this by offering an exclusive, secure, and entertaining MEME that is not only packed with utilities but also accompanies significant milestones—all of which will be successfully delivered, in contrast to the shortcomings observed in many other projects.Roadmap:0 - 1MBABA started its journey by updating Dextools at a market cap of $7,000, showing its commitment to longevity and a proactive approach. Initially, we allocated $20,000 for marketing and $10,000 to improve liquidity, enhancing chart stability. All of the LP has been burned.1M - 10Mat the 1-10 million market cap range, our goal is to reach 1,000 Telegram members and followers on Twitter (X). As of the writing of this white paper, we have updated DEX Screener and listed on Ave.ai. Additionally, we are improving the quality of our influencers by collaborating with more well-known figures, something we intend to continue with BABA. Upon reaching a 5 million market cap floor, we will fasttrack our current CMC listing submission for BABA. At this stage, we will also start the development of the BABA NFTs, which will have an use case on BABA's staking platform and in our upcoming Metaverse when we reach a 1 billion market cap. The development of BABA's staking platform will start at a 10 million market cap floor. The BABA NFTs will enable stakers to increase their APY from 8% to 15%, providing one of the most generous APY rates among MEMES and utility projects. This serves as a way to reward our investors, allowing them to earn passive income while waiting for BABA to realize its full potential. To enhance stability and safety for our investors on the DEX and prevent sudden market fluctuations, we plan to get listed on a reputable CEX. We will be the only ones with access to liquidity to avoid our first CEX to dump on us. The CEX listing will be done with a 10 million market cap floor.10M - 100M
