During the event, Dr. Young-bae Moon, Vice President of Bloom Technology, the company developing Locus Chain, highlighted the critical need for high-performance blockchains like Locus Chain in the rapidly evolving AI industry. He asserted that “A sufficiently fast and scalable blockchain can manage the foundational data necessary for AI generation as well as the data produced by AI. This capability would help prevent the illegal collection of AI data and eliminate false information, thereby mitigating the antisocial aspects of AI that pose significant threats to humanity’s economy, security, and social stability. Furthermore, data providers would have their rights protected, while AI developers could achieve greater data precision, fostering a virtuous ecosystem that significantly enhances AI. However, most existing blockchain technologies are not suitable for this purpose due to their limitations in performance and scalability. Currently, Locus Chain is the only blockchain capable of delivering the extremely fast processing speeds and scalability required for large-scale applications in the AI industry.”

The attendees responded positively to this presentation, recognizing that concerns regarding AI technology could be effectively managed through Locus Chain and that it could also cultivate a more advanced ecosystem.

Additionally, Ray Nakazato, Creta's Chief Creative Officer and a former game development producer at Microsoft, shared an ambitious vision for the Creta ecosystem that leverages AI technology to significantly simplify content development.
