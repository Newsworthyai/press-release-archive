# edgeX is at the forefront of DeFi innovation, pioneering a high-performance, modular financial system.

As Bitcoin ETFs gain approval, blockchain technology and crypto assets are increasingly capturing the public's attention. Driven by Wall Street capital, BTC's price recently surged to nearly $74,000. As crypto assets move further into the mainstream, choosing a secure and reliable platform to buy and hold these assets has become crucial. In recent years, several crypto trading and asset management platforms have collapsed—such as the downfall of FTX, the default of Genesis, a lending platform under the Digital Currency Group (DCG), and the collapse of Babel Finance. These incidents have prompted regulators to tighten oversight and reinforce Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements. However, another solution is to turn to fully decentralized platforms. Due to their decentralized and non-custodial nature, these platforms do not require KYC or regulatory oversight, allowing them to operate autonomously on-chain, ensuring user safety. This is precisely what edgeX aims to achieve by building a fully decentralized financial system.

edgeX: A High-Performance Modular Financial System

edgeX is a high-performance, modular financial system designed to help users build decentralized finance (DeFi) products effortlessly, even without coding knowledge. Incubated by Amber Group, a globally leading, compliant liquidity provider and digital asset manager with approximately $5 billion in assets under management, edgeX serves around 30 banks and 2,000 institutions.

The innovative modular design of edgeX offers the flexibility and simplicity of assembling LEGO bricks, catering to the diverse needs of different users. The platform's modules are designed with minimal barriers to entry, ensuring high performance and scalability for all users. edgeX integrates multiple modules, including trading, liquidity, lending, insurance, leverage, UI/UX, and wallets. This allows both developers with programming experience and regular users to easily create their own DeFi products, fostering an open financial ecosystem. The official trading platform, edgeX exchange, will fully demonstrate the powerful capabilities of this modular system by seamlessly combining various features and interactions, providing users with a convenient experience similar to that of a centralized exchange while ensuring the security of their assets.
