At the core of this partnership lies a shared mission: to empower individuals and systems with high-quality, validated data while ensuring privacy and user ownership in an increasingly interconnected digital world where users can profit from their data and not just big tech companies. Together, dFusion and VANA are laying the foundation for a transparent, trustworthy, and decentralized data ecosystem.

“We’re thrilled to build on the VANA ecosystem as part of our mission to democratize high-quality language data for the entire AI community—not just for big tech. By aggregating this data through Telegram channels, we aim to take another meaningful step toward making knowledge more accessible, inclusive and profitable for the end user. Partnering with VANA aligns perfectly with dFusion’s vision, fostering strategic synergy that enhances both our platform and the community’s ability to better understand and explore the topics that matter most to them,” said Roger Ying, co-founder of dFusion AI.

* Captures and verifies chat data securely, starting with Telegram.
* Ensures privacy while decentralizing data access.
* Builds a foundation for AI models to sound more human and contextually accurate.

The DataDAO Advantage
