# WorldShards Rolls Out Complete Economy System with Pre-TGE Airdrops for Players

The WorldShards team is super excited to announce the opening of its in-game economy. The project went live on Open Loot, right alongside Big Time and other successful Web3 games.

The full economy will go live in December 2024, after which the TGE will follow early in 2025. This milestone shows how far it has come since the February 2024 early access release of the game.

New Opportunities for WorldShards PlayersNew opportunities are on the horizon for avid gamers as the highly anticipated in-game economy launch approaches.

Proxy Tokens will be introduced in mid-December. At this point, these tokens will become the main currency to access NFT crafting and in-game upgrades. This feature will let players focus on gameplay and convert their tokens at a 1:1 ratio during the 2025 TGE.

WorldShards is removing access code requirements this December, providing all users with a 30-day trial period to experience the game. And if certain in-game activity criteria are met during this trial, players can permanently join the ranks of WorldShards enthusiasts.

Rewards and Community EmpowermentAnother important feature that gamers will appreciate in Phase 2 is the airdrop campaign. This represents a form of reward for active players, including trial members, depending on their merits in the game. Importantly, one does not have to own an NFT to be eligible for inclusion in the airdrop.

Current players are given welcome bundles as an added bonus to gift to their peers. These bundles grant full game access and a generous amount of premium currency called gems. Additionally, future purchases of Welcome Bundles will also come with an extra bundle to gift.
