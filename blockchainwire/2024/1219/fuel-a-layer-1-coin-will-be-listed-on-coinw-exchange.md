The Rise of $FUEL: A Truly High Performance Layer 1The FUEL token is the native cryptocurrency of the Fuel Network, a Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution designed to enhance the Ethereum blockchain. Launched with the goal of creating a more equitable and verifiable internet, FUEL plays a crucial role in securing Fuel's decentralized sequencer and facilitating a user-friendly experience by eliminating gas fees through innovative economic incentives.

Fuel Network leverages Application Specific Sequencing to provide high transaction throughput, reportedly exceeding 600 transactions per second, while maintaining minimal costs—around $0.0002 per transaction. This approach aims to replicate a Web2-like experience, making blockchain technology more accessible to everyday users. The FUEL token will be available as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum and also operate on Fuel's own L2 chain, further integrating with existing decentralized applications (dApps) and services.

The introduction of FUEL is pivotal for the ecosystem's growth, with over 51% of its total supply allocated to community initiatives, including rewards for early contributors and participants in the Fuel Points Program. This community-centric strategy not only incentivizes engagement but also fosters a collaborative environment for developers and users alike.
