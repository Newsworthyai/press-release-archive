Bank-Grade Security Measures Safeguarding User Assets

The new digital asset custody service incorporates bank-grade security measures, including multi-signature technology, cold wallet storage, and real-time monitoring systems. The multi-signature technology ensures multiple layers of asset protection, while cold wallet storage keeps the majority of assets offline, guarding against network attacks. Additionally, Dexfly has implemented a round-the-clock security monitoring system to promptly detect and address any abnormal activities.
