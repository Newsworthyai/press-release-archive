Ready to Fight, a social network for a community of at least 2 billion athletes worldwide, has teamed up with leading company Kauri Finance WEB3 Bank to present an innovative financial product called Ready to Pay.

All requirements are met by a single cross-platform payment solution accessible to everyone.

Oleksandr Usyk commented on the collaboration: "In recent years, boxing has grown rapidly. Now, it needs to modernize, adopting new management approaches and transparent business models. The sport also requires new technologies to enhance collaboration among the various stakeholders in the boxing ecosystem. Ready to Pay is about providing our users with the tools they need to manage their finances securely and efficiently."

Kauri Finance, a fast-developing Web3 bank founded by Oleksii Pavlov’s, proposed its unique solution based on the extensive global banking experience gained since 2017.

"As in sport, accuracy and speed are also required in finance, but the process is also important in addition to the result itself. Our mission is to make financial management super simple and weightless. Ready to Pay is a convenient way to enter the world of cryptocurrencies. This solution blurs the lines between cryptocurrencies and fiat money and makes financial transactions simple, without unnecessary barriers or complicated processes.” - said the owner and CEO of Kauri.One and Kauri Finance WEB3 Bank Oleksiy Pavlov.
