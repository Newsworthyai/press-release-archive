# Immunefi and Ethereum Foundation Kick-Off Attackathon With $1.5M in Rewards  To Enhance Ethereum’s Protocol Security

Immunefi, the leading onchain crowdsourced security platform protecting over $190 billion in assets, kicks off the first Attackathon with the Ethereum Foundation, featuring a total reward pool of $1.5 million.

The Attackathon represents the first and largest-ever crowdsourced security audit competition conducted to augment security for the entirety of the protocol’s code. It features a time-bound code review program hosted by Immunefi, ensuring top-tier engagement from elite security researchers. The competition kicks off following an educational period designed to enhance accessibility for the broader security researcher community and deepen their engagement within the Ethereum ecosystem.

The Attackathon is a unique competition in which the reward pool has been directly sponsored by the Ethereum community and leading projects connected to the ecosystem, including:

* Ethereum Foundation
* ByBit
* Wormhole
* Arbitrum Foundation
* The Graph
* GMX
* BASE

The sponsored pool is deposited directly into the Attackathon vault on Immunefi, a proprietary solution designed to transparently display the allocation of a program’s funds and streamline the payment process between projects and security researchers.

“We’re excited to bring the global security community together to strengthen Ethereum protocol’s security. This is not only the first-ever crowdsourced security audit, but also a proactive step toward ensuring Ethereum protocol’s future and its growing impact on our daily lives,” said Fredrik Svantes, Protocol Security Research Lead at the Ethereum Foundation.

Immunefi operates the largest web3 security community with over 45,000 researchers. It protects over $190 billion in user funds for established projects like Chainlink, Wormhole, MakerDAO, TheGraph, Synthetix, Polygon, Optimism, and more. Immunefi has paid out the most significant bug bounties in the software industry, amounting to over $110 million while saving over $25 billion in user funds. Currently, Immunefi offers over $180 million in bounty rewards. 80% of projects find vulnerabilities missed by audits thanks to Immunefi’s researchers.

“We’ve created a dynamic environment for security researchers to join the largest security initiative the Ethereum community has seen,” said Mitchell Amador, Founder and CEO of Immunefi. “With the educational period for the Attackathon now complete, it’s time for the community to shine. This is the moment where each participant contributes to fortifying Ethereum protocol, ensuring a safer future for users worldwide.”

“The Attackathon is designed to empower researchers to safeguard the foundations of Ethereum protocol,” said Sajjad Rehman, VP of Revenue at Immunefi. “The educational period saw remarkable engagement from the community, laying a strong groundwork for the protocol’s mega audit competition.”
