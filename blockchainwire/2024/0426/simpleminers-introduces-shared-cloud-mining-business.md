# Simpleminers Introduces Shared Cloud Mining Business

Simpleminers, a leading Bitcoin mining service provider, per a recent announcement, introduces a shared cloud mining business for institutional and low-income investors. This new product dispels the need for potential investors to buy, operate, maintain, and rent sites to kick off mining activities. It allows everyone to invest by merely purchasing a mining contract. Investors do not bear the brunt of mining tools, energy, maintenance, operations, labor, etc.

“The cloud mining business can ensure that Simpleminers has a steady stream of funds to deploy computing power to increase Bitcoin production. Investors can avoid the risk of asset fluctuations caused by directly holding Bitcoin, and can also avoid the unpredictability of output faced by their investment in mining. This is a great win-win project for everyone,” Simpleminers’ executives say.

Simpleminers’ shared cloud mining business aligns with the company’s vision to simplify crypto investments, enabling new and existing customers to conveniently purchase mining contracts and earn each time new blocks are added to the network.

Simpleminers’ Shared Cloud Mining Business

With Bitcoin prices expected to surge after the highly anticipated halving took place this month, holders can be confident of massive returns in the upcoming bull run. It is still an ideal cycle for investing and Simpleminers is positioned to deliver a secure, low-cost, and genuine platform for potential investors to get in. It is breaking existing entry barriers, offering everyone an opportunity to seamlessly invest in the industry.

The team introduces a straightforward registration process filled with bonuses.

Potential customers can start by downloading the Simpleminers application on either of the IOS or Android app stores. The team includes a $10 registration bonus for new users. Once the registration process is successful, prospective investors will choose from a range of cloud mining contracts, each with a daily percentage income (the maximum is 3%).

Investors can also earn an “invitation income” when they refer their friends to the Simpleminers platform. They can get up to 3% of their referral’s investments and if their referral invites others to purchase a contract, they also earn 1% of their investments. It is an ideal passive income source.
