# Deleno IFC emphasizes sustainable financial products and investments, actively advocating for large-scale investments.

Assuming you have a sum of money in hand and choose not to invest or manage it, keeping it in cash. In the modern economy, inflation is a prevalent phenomenon, which means the purchasing power of currency gradually decreases over time. This implies that the cash you hold will lose its value in terms of future purchasing power, i.e., it will depreciate.Now, let's take a look at the importance of investment. Suppose you decide to invest your funds in the stock market. By selecting stable stocks and companies with significant long-term growth potential, you have the opportunity to benefit from the returns of the stock market. Historically, the stock market has shown a relatively stable growth trend over the long term, surpassing the level of inflation. This means that your investment may generate positive returns, allowing your funds to appreciate.

For example, let's say you invested your funds in stocks of a high-quality company in the past few years. During this period, the company achieved consistent profit growth and rewarded shareholders through dividends and stock price appreciation. Due to your investment, your initial capital increased by a certain proportion, surpassing the level of inflation. This means that in the future, you will be able to purchase more goods and services instead of seeing the continuous depreciation of the cash in your hands.

Furthermore, investment can provide diverse sources of income. Apart from the stock market, you can also consider investing in bonds, real estate, funds, and other asset classes, gaining returns from different investment fields. This diversified investment portfolio can help you cope with risks in different market conditions and provide a stable source of income.

Investment is crucial for preserving and increasing value. Choosing not to invest or manage your finances will result in the depreciation of your funds, failing to keep up with the pace of inflation. Through investment, you have the opportunity to achieve positive returns and maintain or increase your wealth. Therefore, understanding the importance of investment and developing an appropriate investment plan based on your circumstances are key to achieving financial goals and protecting wealth.
