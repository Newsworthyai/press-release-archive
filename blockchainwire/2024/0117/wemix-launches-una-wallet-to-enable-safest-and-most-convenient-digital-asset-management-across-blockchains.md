The WEMIX Foundation has officially launched ‘una Wallet’ (https://unagi.io/una-wallet), the official wallet service of unagi that enables convenient monitoring and management of digital assets across multiple chains in a single wallet, offering enhanced security and a faster authentication process.

una Wallet facilitates the seamless management of assets dispersed across various chains, enabling users to access them all in one place and ensuring a more convenient omnichain experience. Users will be able to manage assets on major protocols including Arbitrum, Avalanche, BNB Smart Chain, Ethereum, Kroma, Optimism, Polygon, and WEMIX3.0.

Announced in September, ‘unagi’ (unagi.io/), short for ‘Unbound Networking & Accelerating Growth Initiative’, aims to construct an all-encompassing ecosystem that goes beyond the limitations of diverse blockchains by seamlessly integrating, connecting and encompassing multiple networks, fostering an environment where they coexist harmoniously. The initiative provides an optimal route for users to utilize dApp services at the lowest cost and transactions that occur both on and between chains can all be recorded and searched.

una Wallet Key Features

una Wallet offers multiple secure features to facilitate and streamline management and trading of digital assets on supported blockchains:

The safest and most convenient asset management across blockchain networks
