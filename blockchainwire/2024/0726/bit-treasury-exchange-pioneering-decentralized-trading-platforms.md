# Bit Treasury Exchange: Pioneering Decentralized Trading Platforms

Bit Treasury Exchange Introduction:

Bit Treasury Exchange is an American decentralized exchange headquartered in Albany (the capitol of New York State). In 2020, Bit Treasury Exchange announced that their headquarters would no longer be in Albany, but declared that it would adopt a remote working model, so employees are working in offices around the world, and that there would be no traditional central “headquarters.”

Bit Treasury Exchange was founded in September 2012 and launched services for trading Bitcoin in April 2013. In 2015, Bit Treasury Exchange decided to expand the range of cryptocurrencies it could trade, so it established a separate cryptocurrency exchange to meet investors' trading needs. Bit Treasury Exchange obtained its New York State Bitcoin trading license on March 26, 2018. Today, Bit Treasury Exchange has approximately 48 million verified users, 8,000 institutions, and 134,000 ecosystem partners in more than 100 countries.

The main features of Bit Treasury Exchange:

·The seventh Bitcoin exchange in the United States to hold a formal license.

·Bit Treasury Exchange has purchased insurance to provide investors with certain asset protection.

· Supports fiat currency purchases of Bitcoin, with an extensive network of banking partners, and can transact via EFT payments, ACH/SWIFT/SEPA transfers, and credit cards and PayPal.

·The transaction fee is between 0% and 0.5%, which is determined by the pending order and non-pending order transactions, as well as the size of the transaction amount. Using competitive pricing, users’ fees are tiered based on both their position size and their transaction frequency.

·The institutional account trading channel has the lowest asset threshold of any major cryptocurrency exchange.

Who is the founder of Bit Treasury Exchange:

Andrew Norton, founder and CEO of Bit Treasury Exchange, is a former software developer of Goldman Sachs Group, specializing in high frequency trading.

As the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange, Bit Treasury Exchange not only provides users with a choice of low threshold institutional account trading types for cryptocurrencies, but also spans the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Is Bit Treasury Exchange safe?

Bit Treasury Exchange is considered a safe cryptocurrency exchange with robust systems in place to ensure the security of customer accounts, including the use of 2FA verification, FDIC insured USD balances, device management, address whitelisting, and cold storage setup.

In addition, Bit Treasury Exchange adopts a threshold signature scheme to ensure the security of user funds, which uses an encryption protocol for distributed key generation and signatures. It allows the construction of signatures distributed among different parties, with each user receiving a copy of the private signing key. For example, if there are three users, at least two of them need to join in order to sign the transaction.

In addition to depositing funds at centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, users can also choose to transfer funds to reputable wallets.
