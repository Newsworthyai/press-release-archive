Post-Halving Bitcoin: What’s Happening

Bitcoin's journey since its inception in January 2009 has been nothing short of a roller coaster ride, one characterized by remarkable highs and daunting lows. Born in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, Bitcoin emerged as a decentralized alternative to traditional currencies, promising to wrest control of monetary policy from governments and central banks. Conceived by the enigmatic figure Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin quickly garnered attention for its potential to revolutionize the financial landscape through autonomous governance and decentralized control.

Yet, despite its tumultuous fluctuations over the years, the long-term trajectory has always been seen going upward and being on a road to positive growth.

Over the past decade, Bitcoin has evolved into one of the most captivating trading opportunities for anyone from weekend investors to serious business traders, with some reaping immense wealth of millions of dollars through Bitcoin trading over time.

In 2023, following months of speculation, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially greenlit the trading of Bitcoin in an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). Subsequently, Bitcoin ETFs made their debut on Jan. 11, 2024. The introduction of Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 sparked a surge of investment, contributing to Bitcoin's climb to a record-breaking high above $73,000 in March.
