# Alpha Liquid Fund announces a strategic partnership with XNET Foundation and commits to $2m token purchase

Alpha Liquid Fund, the leading digital asset crypto fund under Alpha Transform Holdings (ATH), a financial services and advisory firm in digital assets, is pleased to announce a strategic partnership with the XNET Foundation and a $2m token purchase in its $XNET token ecosystem. This partnership underscores ATH’s commitment to supporting innovative projects transforming the decentralized wireless (DeWi) sector.

XNET is revolutionizing mobile connectivity by addressing limitations in traditional network infrastructure. By leveraging blockchain coordination on Solana, Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) spectrum, and Wi-Fi 6+, XNET enables local builders to deploy LTE/5G or carrier-grade Wi-Fi in underserved areas. This decentralized, community-driven approach reduces costs, improves scalability, and creates resilient connectivity solutions, disrupting traditional Mobile Network Operator (MNO) models.

ATH’s purchase will be conducted through its dedicated OTC team, acquiring tokens directly from XNET’s treasury to support the project’s growth.

“As strategic partners, we believe XNET has the potential to redefine mobile connectivity,” said Wes Levitt, CIO of Alpha Liquid Fund. “We are committed to supporting its vision for accessible, decentralized wireless networks.”
