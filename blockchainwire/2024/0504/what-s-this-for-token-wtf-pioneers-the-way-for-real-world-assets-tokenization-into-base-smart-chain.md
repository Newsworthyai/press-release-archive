What are the benefits of Tokenizing real world assets? Asset tokenization has the potential not only to facilitate more efficient transactions, but also to democratize access to certain kinds of investment opportunities and bring more liquidity to traditionally illiquid asset classes. (RWAs) are fungible or non-fungible tokens that represent traditional financial assets on the blockchain. RWAs can represent tangible assets such as real estate and art or intangible assets such as government bonds and carbon credits. These will function on the BASE chain through smart contracts, and one token can amount to a whole object as well as a part of it.

The $WTF ecosystem uses a unique tax and cooldown strategy to maintain healthy liquidity and ensure fair participation in its Raffle Based Lottery System among all holders. Token Holders will be able to own a piece or a whole of its RWAs all while receiving rewards.

$WTF will utilize its presale funds to better the ecosystem and benefit its holders. 50% will be for the Liquidity Pool, 25% will be used for marketing, 1st CEX Partnership & KOL and 25% for the build out costs.
