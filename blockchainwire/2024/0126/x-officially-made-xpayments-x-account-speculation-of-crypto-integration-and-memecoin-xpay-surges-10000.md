# X Officially Made XPayments X account, Speculation of Crypto Integration and Memecoin $XPAY surges 10,000%

Elon Musk’s “everything app” X (formerly Twitter) has created a dedicated account for its upcoming payments feature, fueling crypto community speculation about whether cryptocurrencies will be implemented.

While no posts have been made on the account yet, it holds the gold badge, indicating it is a verified organization. Additionally, it carries the X badge, suggesting it is associated with X.

Many speculate that it’s the most likely crypto to be included on X if any were to be featured as Elon Musk has incorporated Dogecoin for payments on Tesla’s merchandise store, along with occasionally mentioning it on social media.

As such a token named XPayments ($XPAY) that launched August 2023 surged over 10,000% on the weekend of the news as speculators are betting on more news to come. (Note: that XPayments is not affiliated with X, XPayments, or Elon Musk and is just a memecoin)

In 2023, Elon Musk released two other products Grok AI and Cybertruck. Memecoins $GROK and $TRUCK were made and surged to considerable prices among the hype of these products.

Maybe with the release of XPayments later this year, we'll see the memecoin XPayments ($XPAY) rise to considerable heights based on the hype of Elon Musk's new financial payments solution, XPayments. The links of the token are listed below for your convenience.
