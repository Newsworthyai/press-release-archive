About SHND

SHND is the native asset of the StrongHands layer-1 blockchain with a max supply of 29 billion coins. As one of the earliest adopters of a hybrid model that uses both the PoS and PoW to mint their coins, SHND has built upon the foundational principles of Bitcoin, introducing enhancements in energy efficiency and network security. By combining the strengths of both staking and mining, SHND provides a unique approach to securing the network and incentivizing participation.

- POS miners are rewarded with 2500 SHND coins per block after holding their coins for 30 days, ensuring a robust and sustained commitment to network integrity.

-POW miner use Bitcoin ASICS as StrongHands is a SHA256 coin, and they receive 1800 coins per POW block.

The SHND coin serves as the financial backbone of the StrongHands ecosystem. StrongHands is a community coin and an open project so anybody could step in and develop the ecosystem.

With this idea, members of SHND community developed a DEX -having a separate token (ISHND Stronghands Finance) and a mastenode coin.
