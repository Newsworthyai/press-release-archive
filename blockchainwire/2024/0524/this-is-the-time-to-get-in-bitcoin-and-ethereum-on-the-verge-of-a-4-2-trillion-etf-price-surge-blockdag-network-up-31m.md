Bitcoin surged over $70,000 per BTC on Wednesday, nearing its all-time high of $73,500 reached last March. Meanwhile Ethereum has seen a 20% rise to nearly $4,000 per Ether, as the crypto market anticipates a pivotal vote in Washington.

The rally follows the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requesting updates from entities applying to issue spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Analysts foresee approval triggering a $4.2 trillion price surge, especially after the SEC's communication with potential fund managers, suggesting accelerated approval may be imminent.

ETF analysts have increased approval odds, citing the political climate and potential impact on Ethereum's value. The decision is expected this week on VanEck's and Ark/21 Shares' ETF applications, with analysts anticipating a significant market response akin to Bitcoin's ETF approval in January.

The potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is predicted to propel the Ethereum price to $8,000 by 2024 and $14,000 by 2025, impacting Bitcoin positively as well. With spot Bitcoin ETFs reporting record inflows and continued growth since their launch, analysts anticipate further market highs, aligning with projections of a $150,000 Bitcoin price by 2024 and $200,000 by 2025, amounting to a combined near-$4.2 trillion valuation for Bitcoin and Ethereum.

In the meantime, BlockDAG Network is revolutionizing the cryptocurrency landscape, emerging as the fastest-growing community in the crypto world and hosting the largest Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of 2024. With over 120,000 holders already on board, up $31 million in record time and a goal of $600 million within reach, BlockDAG is not just a network but a whole movement.
