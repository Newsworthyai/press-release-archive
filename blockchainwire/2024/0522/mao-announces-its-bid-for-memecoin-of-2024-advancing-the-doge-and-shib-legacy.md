# $MAO Announces its Bid for “Memecoin of 2024,” Advancing the $DOGE and $SHIB Legacy

MAOCAT, an Ethereum-based memecoin building an ambitious DeFi ecosystem, announced its intention to become this year’s standout meme token. $MAO is currently on a successful presale that far exceeds all expectations, raising over $300,000 so far. At this pace, the cat-themed memecoin could reach the fame of popular dog-themed cryptocurrencies Dogecoin ($DOGE) and Shiba Inu ($SHIB).

Memecoins have been carving their distinct niche in the crypto market since 2020. Generally, these crypto tokens spur from memes and internet jokes, taking a laidback approach to current events or fads. The most popular memecoins include Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepecoin, and Floki. These animal-themed memecoins attract large communities of crypto enthusiasts and collectors.

MAOCAT aims to become a famous and widely supported memecoin as the first cat-themed meme token on Ethereum. One of its goals is to dethrone dogs as the main animal theme for memecoins and establish cats, specifically $MAO, as the leading meme sensation in the crypto landscape. To this end, the project plans to build on the legacy of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, among others, while proposing a versatile and lucrative DeFi ecosystem.

MAOCAT has a high-reaching roadmap that it will put into effect after the $MAO presale ends. Among its milestones is the launch of a unique collection of 10,000 MAOCAT NFTs, all super-rare and with multiple benefits for collectors. The project’s early adopters will have the options to buy, sell, or trade these non-fungible tokens in the project’s upcoming NFT Marketplace.

Another important objective on MAOCAT’s development path is a farming platform, MAOCAT SWAP. Users can engage in lucrative operations on this platform, such as farming and staking. Moreover, they will have access to the project’s proprietary launchpad for initial DEX offerings (IDOs), where they can also mint NFTs.

Lastly, MAOCAT plans to release a play-to-earn game featuring the beloved symbol of $MAO memecoins. This feature will allow users to access passive earning opportunities while enjoying fun and exciting quests via their $MAO and MAOCAT NFT holdings.

All these features establish MAOCAT as a rapidly-growing and diverse ecosystem, a rare presence in the memecoin sector. While most meme-based tokens ride a short wave of popularity, MAOCAT avoids falling into obscurity by building numerous and engaging DeFi options for its backers.
