Rumors spread all of January regarding the interest of other holdings from the CIS to acquire the company. However, the buyer’s identity was revealed on February 20th as an inclusion of a $10 million acquisition deal. Apart Sharing officially became part of the Alikson Group corporation. What is the company’s sphere of interest and how does Alikson Group secure such deals?

Multiple Business Ventures

Alikson Group builds and runs numerous business ventures in retail, wholesale trade, technology, logistics, eCommerce, finance, investment, and real estate. The group boosted its revenue to $865 million in 2023. It became the most rapidly growing private company in the CIS with an average yearly revenue growth rate of 300%.

Building an Ecosystem

Alikson Group Gasan Mustafaev, CEO and founder, commented on the 2024 deal and shared plans, "Apart Sharing is an interesting and in-demand technological company.
