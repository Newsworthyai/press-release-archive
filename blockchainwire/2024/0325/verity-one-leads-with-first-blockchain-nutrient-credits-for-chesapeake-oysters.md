Press Release:Dubai, UAE—Verity One Ltd, renowned for its innovative use of AI and blockchain in verification and certification, proudly announces a pioneering initiative: launching the first-ever blockchain-based nutrient credits derived from Chesapeake Bay oysters. This initiative emphasizes Verity One's commitment to TRUTH MATTERS™ and its role as a forerunner in environmental sustainability and digital trust.

Since its foundation in 2001, Verity One Ltd has enhanced transparency, authenticity, and trust in product supply chains. Verity One is dedicated to pioneering sustainable and trustworthy practices across various industries by venturing into nutrient credit trading on the blockchain.

Introducing these blockchain nutrient credits marks a significant milestone in conservation and sustainability efforts, especially for the Chesapeake Bay region. Through this blockchain-enabled platform, Verity One guarantees the credibility and transparency of the nutrient trading process, providing businesses with a secure and verifiable way to mitigate their environmental footprint.

Adam Reiser, CEO and Founder of Verity One Ltd, stated, "Launching the first blockchain-based nutrient credits from Chesapeake Bay oysters is more than an innovative venture; it's a stride towards a sustainable and transparent future. By integrating blockchain and AI, we are advancing environmental conservation and reinforcing the reliability and integrity of supply chains."

This move will enhance Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scoring and meet other mandates from the EPA, state, and local governments, setting a new benchmark for environmental responsibility and corporate sustainability.
