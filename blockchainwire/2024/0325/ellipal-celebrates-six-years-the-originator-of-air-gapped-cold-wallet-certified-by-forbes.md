Globally acclaimed for revolutionizing digital asset security, ELLIPAL remains at the forefront with its trailblazing, 100% offline transaction technology, facilitated by secure QR code scanning. This anniversary not only highlights ELLIPAL’s journey from an innovative startup to a Forbes-endorsed entity but also reaffirms its adherence to Satoshi Nakamoto's foundational principles, embodied in the mantra "not your keys, not your coins."

Forbes’ Seal of Approval: A Testament to Excellence

More than just a cold wallet, it represents a synthesis of design and functionality, boasting a sleek build, smooth tactile feedback, and a user-friendly touchscreen.

Putting Users First: Redefining Interaction

In 2018, ELLIPAL distinguished itself from traditional models, like those exemplified by Ledger, which connect via USB for online transactions, by introducing a pioneering air-gapped technology that ensures 100% offline functionality through a unique QR code scanning system. This innovative method ensures that private keys remain completely offline, significantly enhancing protection against potential hacking threats. Additionally, the inclusion of a large 4.0-inch screen not only improves usability but also guarantees that transaction signatures are clearly visible, thereby boosting user confidence. Through these measures, ELLIPAL emphasizes a seamless and secure user experience in digital asset management.

In addition, its close collaboration with Metamask significantly augments the user experience by merging traditional and decentralized financial services, ensuring a holistic, user-friendly platform.

Forward-Thinking Leadership

In its sixth year, ELLIPAL has shown substantial growth, managing assets exceeding $12 billion and marking its presence in over 140 countries.
