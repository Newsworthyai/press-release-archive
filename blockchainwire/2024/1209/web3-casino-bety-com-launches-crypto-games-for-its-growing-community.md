Here are the game's transfer limit rules:

- USDT transfers are limited to 10-10,000 USDT;

- TRX transfers are limited to 10-100,000 TRX.Transfers below or over the limit are invalid bets and will not be rewarded or refunded. The betting rules are also very clear. The last digit of the transfer amount determines the bet:

- Player wins: Ends in 2 (e.g., 1002, 312);

- Tie: Ends in 3 (e.g., 2003, 503).

In terms of payouts, here is what can happen:
