# BitGo Becomes the First US Qualified Custodian to Offer Secure Institutional Yield for $2T of Untapped Bitcoin Liquidity via Core

Core Foundation, the entity dedicated to growing Core, the largest Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem, today announced its integration with BitGo, the global leader in institutional-grade custody and financial services for digital assets. The integration marks a new era in Bitcoin DeFi (BTCfi) as BitGo becomes the first custodian to enable institutional access to Dual Staking, enabling clients to earn scalable Bitcoin yield while maintaining the hallmark security and trustlessness of the Bitcoin blockchain.

Unlocking Institutional BTC Yield at ScaleBitGo’s integration with Core introduces institutional clients to secure Bitcoin staking , leveraging Core’s cutting-edge Dual Staking model. By timelocking client Bitcoin and staking CORE tokens directly from BitGo’s qualified custody platform, institutions can unlock scalable, tiered yield without incurring any slashing, credit, counterparty, or smart contract risks on their principal assets.

Core is the leading Bitcoin aligned ecosystem, with CORE being the fastest growing top 15 chain, exceeding $1B in TVL, according to DefiLlama.

“BitGo’s decision to integrate Core is a milestone for institutional-grade Bitcoin staking,” said Rich Rines, Initial Contributor at Core. “By combining Core’s secure, sustainable, and scalable staking solutions with BitGo’s unparalleled custody services, we’re ushering in a new era of Bitcoin DeFi.”

What the Integration Delivers

* Institutional-Grade Custody: BitGo’s trusted custody solutions enable secure, user-friendly staking of Bitcoin and CORE tokens, unlocking sustainable yield for institutional investors.
* Enhanced BTC Yield: Dual Staking offers higher returns, with CORE staking unlocking top-tier yield rates.
* Battle-Tested Security: Core’s staking solutions allow Bitcoin holders to retain full custody of their assets, avoiding counterparty risk and maintaining Bitcoin’s security-first ethos.

"BitGo’s integration with Core underscores our commitment to expanding opportunities for institutional clients to securely generate yield from their Bitcoin holdings," said Mike Belshe, CEO of BitGo. "As the first US qualified custodian to enable access to Core’s innovative Dual Staking model, we’re delivering scalable and sustainable solutions that align with Bitcoin’s security-first principles while unlocking new value for institutions."
