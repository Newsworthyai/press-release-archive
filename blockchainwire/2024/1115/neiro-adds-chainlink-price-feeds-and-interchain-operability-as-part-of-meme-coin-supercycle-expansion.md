Dogecoin sister token NEIRO today announced new partnerships that position it to take advantage of the current meme coin supercycle, including adopting Chainlink Price Feeds on Ethereum and the integration of a Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).NEIRO has adopted Chainlink Price Feeds on Ethereum to support secure markets around its $NEIRO token. Market price feeds incorporate three layers of aggregation at the data source, node operator, and oracle network layers, providing industry-standard security and reliability on the price data referenced. NEIRO has also integrated Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) into its token to enable secure cross-chain token transfers across Base and Ethereum.
