CoinW’s Futures Trading Fee StructureCoinW’s new fee structure is designed to make futures trading more accessible and cost-effective:

* · Maker Fee: 0.01%
* · Taker Fee: 0.06%
* · Funding Fee: Position Value * Current Funding Rate

This competitive fee structure offers traders an opportunity to reduce their trading costs significantly, especially for those employing specific trading strategies.

Maker vs. Taker Fees: What Are They and Why Do They Matter?Understanding the difference between Maker and Taker fees is essential for optimizing your trading approach. Maker fees apply when you add liquidity to the order book by placing limit orders, while Taker fees apply when you remove liquidity by placing market orders. CoinW’s 0.01% Maker fee allows traders to engage in low-cost trading strategies, enhancing their profitability, particularly for high-frequency and volume traders.

Impact of Fees on Trading StrategyLower Maker fees can have a direct impact on trading strategies. For instance, a DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) strategy can benefit from the 0.01% Maker fee, as it minimizes the costs associated with entering and exiting positions compared to taking Taker fees.

Here’s a quick calculation to illustrate the cost-effectiveness of Maker fees:

* · Number of Contracts: 1
* · Order Value: $10,000
* · Maker Fee Rate: 0.01%

Fee you'll pay when opening this position: $1 (0.01% of $10,000)
