Valory, pioneer of co-owned AI and a leader in the AI agent ecosystem, announces its flagship event series "Agents Unleashed" is coming to Bangkok during Devcon 2024. The event, scheduled for November 13, 2024, will bring together industry leaders, innovators, and enthusiasts at the intersection of Crypto and AI for an evening of insights, networking, and celebration.

Following tremendous success across five major cities including Denver, Berlin, Brussels, San Francisco, and Singapore—where the series has engaged over 4,000 attendees worldwide—Agents Unleashed Bangkok promises to be an extraordinary addition to the global series. The event has consistently attracted top minds in the space, featuring 68 speakers and panelists across previous editions, with the recent Singapore event alone drawing more than 3,200 registrations.

The Bangkok edition will unfold in two distinct parts at the found venue in Bangkok. The first segment, running from 5:00 PM to 9:00 PM, will feature expert panels and fireside chats focusing on how AI agents are revolutionizing user experience, creating new economic models, and transforming industries. This portion of the event has attracted significant industry support, with all sponsorship tiers fully committed. Notable sponsors include Olas, NEAR, and Almanak at the Gold level, alongside other prominent names in the Web3 space such as Spheron, Vana, Nevermined, and Coinbase (CDP).

"The future of AI isn't just imagined, it's experienced," says David Minarsch, Olas Founding Member and CEO of Valory. "Agents Unleashed Bangkok will showcase how AI agents are already transforming the world and powering use cases that enhance human capabilities."

Following the panel, the event will transition into "The Humans Unleashed Party!" from 9:00 PM to 1:00 AM, featuring Bangkok's #1 DJ Nakadia, and top Thai DJ AASH. This celebration will offer attendees an opportunity to network and enjoy an evening of music and entertainment.

Both parts of the event are free to attend and will include catered hors d'oeuvres, drinks, beer, and wine. Professional photography and recording will document the panels and discussions, with content being made available on YouTube in the weeks following the event.
