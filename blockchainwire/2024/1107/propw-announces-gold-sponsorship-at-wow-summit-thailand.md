This summit represents PropW’s other significant presence at an international crypto event of this scale. PropW has cultivated a thriving global community since its launch at the beginning of the year, particularly in Asian markets like Malaysia and Taiwan. The team views this event as a strategic opportunity to connect with a broader community, share insights into their platform, and expand their ongoing education programs. As a Gold Sponsor, PropW will also host a dedicated booth to engage with attendees directly.

On November 10th, the day before the main event, PropW will co-host an exclusive side event with Taskon at ZillaSpace. PropW’s Global Affiliate Director, William, will speak about the platform’s latest advancements, including the recently launched affiliate system, expanded tradable asset pairs, and tailored solutions for affiliates.
