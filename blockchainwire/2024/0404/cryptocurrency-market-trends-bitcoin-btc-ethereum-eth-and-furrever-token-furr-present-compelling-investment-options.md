Bitcoin (BTC) Rollercoaster Ride: Will the Bull Run Again Amidst Market Uncertainty?Bitcoin (BTC) continues its tumultuous journey, currently priced at around $66,288, experiencing a slight 1% dip since yesterday. As the digital gold grapples with ongoing market dynamics, the question on every investor's mind remains: Has the Bitcoin downturn reached its nadir?

Despite recent corrections, BTC is yet to signal a definitive turnaround, with a fresh daily low just recorded at $64,493. Several factors contribute to this uncertain outlook:

Except for BRRR, all ETFs have provided their entry/exit data, revealing subdued Spot Bitcoin ETF volumes and a modest net inflow of $36 million on April 2. While the outflows from ARKB at $87.5 million dampened optimism, institutional investors likely contributed to the sell-off.

Since March 18, we haven't witnessed robust net inflows in the ETF channel (excluding March 26). This trend suggests a group of investors in the ETF channel succumbing to increased bearish sentiments, fueled by concerns over pre-halving declines or Genesis sales. BTC's price may lack crucial support from the ETF channel for some time.

Bitcoin failed to close above $71,500, inviting sellers to push it below $69,000. Moreover, there seems to be limited demand at lower levels for now. As Asian investors awaken and US stock markets open, daily volatility spikes, potentially triggering further selling pressure. Additionally, Friday will see crucial US average hourly earnings, non-farm payroll, and unemployment rate data releases. Higher average earnings could signal negative inflation, while strong employment data might bode ill for the Fed's rate cuts. Hence, investors approach Friday cautiously. Moreover, the Silk Road auctions served as a stark reminder of the assets the US holds, indicating that FUDs persist. Ongoing negative developments related to the Coinbase-Binance lawsuit pose potential risks.

Ethereum (ETH) Struggles to Regain Momentum: Will the $3,500 Support Hold Amidst Resistance Challenges?Ethereum recently showcased a strong upward momentum from the $3,500 support region. However, it is currently trading below the $3,550 level and the 100-hour Simple Moving Average, facing resistance around the $3,550 area on the hourly chart.

To continue the recovery, Ethereum must overcome a significant resistance zone at the $3,600 level. Breaking above this level could provide further momentum to its upward movement. However, bears remain active near the $3,650 and $3,680 resistance levels.

On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $3,630 level, followed by critical levels at $3,650 and $3,680. In particular, surpassing the $3,680 resistance level could signify a stronger bullish momentum for Ethereum. Failure to breach the $3,600 resistance may indicate a potential resumption of a downtrend. Currently, the first support level on the downside is around $3,500, with more significant support near $3,475. A break below this level could lead to the next critical support at $3,450, potentially pushing ETH towards $3,340.

Technical indicators suggest a maintained bullish trend in the hourly MACD for ETH/USD, albeit with some loss of momentum. Meanwhile, the RSI is currently below the 50 level, indicating a potential increase in selling pressure. While disappointment may linger for Ethereum investors following recent declines, repeated tests of the $3,500 and below levels in recent times suggest a potential swift recovery in price.
