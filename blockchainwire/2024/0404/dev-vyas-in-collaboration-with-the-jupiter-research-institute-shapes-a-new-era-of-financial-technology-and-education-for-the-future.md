Upon joining the Jupiter Research Institute, Dev injected his precise insights into the financial markets and passion for education into the institution's daily operations. The projects he oversees are committed to providing top-tier financial education and investment training, exploring how cutting-edge technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence can revolutionize financial services, enhance efficiency and security, and increase market transparency and fairness.

Under Dev's leadership, the Jupiter Research Institute continuously expands the scope and impact of its education and training programs, establishing collaborations with globally renowned financial institutions and tech companies, and introducing the latest market practices and technology updates.
