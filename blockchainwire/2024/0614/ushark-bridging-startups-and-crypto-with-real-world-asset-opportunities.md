# uShark: Bridging Startups and Crypto with Real World Asset Opportunities

The startup ecosystem has become a cornerstone of global innovation and economic growth, driven by entrepreneurs transforming visionary ideas into tangible products and services. Traditionally, funding for startups came from venture capitalists and angel investors, but the advent of equity crowdfunding platforms has democratized this process. Platforms like AngelList, SeedInvest, and Fundable have enabled a broader array of investors to participate in early-stage financing. This shift has contributed to the success of companies like Uber, Airbnb, and Dropbox, which began as fledgling startups and received early-stage funding through such models. This democratization has opened doors for average investors to share in the potential high returns of startup investments. Despite these opportunities, many missed out on early investment rounds that could have yielded substantial rewards. For instance, Uber, now a global ride-hailing giant valued at over $50 billion, started with seed funding from angel investors and venture capital rounds, highlighting the lucrative potential of early-stage investments. According to Facts and Factors, the global crowdfunding market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.8% from 2022 to 2028. The valuation for the global crowdfunding market was USD 13.5 billion in 2021 and is expected to exceed USD 28.2 billion by 2028.

Facilitating investment in startups and early-stage companies has evolved beyond traditional methods. Investors now have access to a spectrum of models, including traditional equity crowdfunding, crypto investments, and hybrid approaches that combine elements of both. Equity crowdfunding allows everyday investors to buy shares in promising startups, breaking down previous barriers to entry. In the crypto space, early-stage blockchain projects can be funded through token sales, democratizing access to potentially high-reward investments. Hybrid models blend traditional and crypto investment avenues, combining the benefits of blockchain technology with the regulatory compliance of traditional securities. This is where uShark comes into play, revolutionizing how individuals can invest in startups. uShark integrates a unique token with their business model, offering an inclusive and accessible platform that balances investment opportunities for all investors. Through uShark, investors can explore real-world asset opportunities and contribute to the success of promising startups, making investment more inclusive and accessible for everyone.

About uShark

uShark aims to harness the interest of small investors in disruptive technologies to facilitate growth. Created by Brazilian entrepreneur and Harvard Business School Alumni Geraldo Marques just a year ago, uShark connects individual investors and legal entities, such as funds, to small companies through the sale of crypto assets.

Instead, it creates a digital environment where promising companies can seek investments from numerous investors willing to contribute smaller amounts.

uShark operates as a startup investment platform, bridging entrepreneurs and investors through the sale of crypto assets. This model is akin to equity crowdfunding but with a unique twist: the negotiation of crypto assets backed by the equity of the companies involved.
