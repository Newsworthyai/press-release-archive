# Linea Going from Strength to Strength with Lynex on the Front Lines

The Linea blockchain has gone from strength to strength over the last quarter, seeing TVL and volume soar. Lynex and its ingenious community engagement strategy stand as a key contributor to this organic growth.This impressive achievement highlights the strength and potential of the Linea ecosystem, a product of the renowned blockchain software houseConsenSys, which is also known for owning the popular cryptocurrency wallet MetaMask. With its lattice-based cryptography, which is faster, less computationally heavy and easier to implement than other cryptography methods, Linea is a key player in the market of Layer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum.

Linea has seen mass organic growth with TVL tripling over the last trimester and volume quadrupling in the last month. Part of this growth has been thanks to the community efforts in bolstering liquidity and driving engagement, coordinated by Lynex, the leading DEX and native liquidity layer on Linea.

Lynex, the top DEX on the network boasts an elevated rendition of the ve(3,3) DEX model and has contributed greatly to the organic growth and engagement on the network, with TVL on the protocol seeing a 1600% increase in the last month at the time of writing. Through a community-centric airdrop mechanism, Lynex is incentivizing investors to explore the ecosystem to use other protocols, to maximise their chances of airdrop, which has proven to be quite an effective tactic in driving growth.

Lynex’s Recent MilestonesThe surge in TVL is a testament to the increasing confidence and interest from the DeFi community in the Linea blockchain and its associated projects, particularly Lynex. The platform has played a crucial role in this growth, thanks partly to its strategic community airdrop, which has successfully attracted a wider user base and fostered a more engaged and vibrant community.

A total of 10% of Lynex's initial supply has been earmarked for distribution to holders of existing ve-like protocols and those who have actively engaged with the Lynex community. This strategic airdrop is a testament to Lynex's dedication to fostering a strong, engaged, and empowered community, and truly embodying the role of being a native liquidity layer. Lynex aims to create a more inclusive and collaborative ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders by rewarding our users for their loyalty and participation.

Lynex has also been named the official DEX partner of Linea’s much-celebrated community coin, FOXY. This partnership comes after Lynex had seen mammoth growth in TVL and token price over the last quarter and solidifies its place at the top of the food chain in the Linea ecosystem.

Lynex’s Innovative Tokenomic Model Helps Drive GrowthLynex continues leading the way in DeFi innovation with its advanced Automated Liquidity Management (ALM) and unique tokenomics. The ALM feature allows users to optimize their liquidity provision, reducing the risks associated with impermanent loss and ensuring more stable and profitable returns. Meanwhile, Lynex's tokenomics model is designed to align the interests of liquidity providers, token holders, and the broader ecosystem, creating a more sustainable and rewarding platform for all participants.

Lynex's innovative tokenomics model, oTokenomics, is revolutionizing the DeFi ecosystem by addressing critical challenges such as token devaluation and incentive misalignment for Liquidity Providers (LPs). This model aligns user and protocol interests, ensuring long-term stability and growth.

Developed in collaboration with security experts at Salus Security, this cutting-edge innovation promises to bring unparalleled privacy to the trading world.
