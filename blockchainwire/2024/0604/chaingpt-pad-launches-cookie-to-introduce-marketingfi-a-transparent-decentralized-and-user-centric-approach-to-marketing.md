Through a partnership between Cookie DAO and Cookie3 and their common vision of MarketingFi unlocking the fair value exchange and re-distribution in web3 and beyond, $COOKIE has entered the Cookie3 three-platform stack, where it became a representation of the marketing value.

Cookie3 is an AI data layer and MarketingFi protocol that bridges businesses, KOLs, and Web3 users. With the support of ChainGPT Pad’s accelerator, the $COOKIE utility token is set to launch on June 3rd to underpin the Cookie3 and Cookie DAO ecosystem and distribute value and rewards to its holders.

As a premier decentralized fundraising and incubation platform for Web3 projects of all types, ChainGPT Pad has been recognized as the most popular launchpad of 2023. The incubation program promotes emerging startups strategically hand-picked by ChainGPT based on their disruptive potential, transforming their ideas into viable business solutions. The program extensively assists in product development, smart contract implementation, and user engagement. Through expert mentorship and access to an extensive network of influential partners and investors, ChainGPT Pad’s incubation provides Web3 startups with the tools to navigate inevitable challenges and thrive.

The Cookie ecosystem, in which the $COOKIE token reigns supreme, finds innovative ways to connect relevant audiences with the right Web3 projects and reward both through incentivized data sharing. The ecosystem’s three platforms help marketers better understand their users, tailor marketing campaigns, and ensure marketing budgets are sent to quality users via advanced AI-powered analytics. It also rewards creators with airdrops, allocations, and tokens for onboarding quality projects through the Cookie Affiliate platform.

With the digital marketing economy set to reach a staggering $650 billion by 2028, Cookie3’s multiplatform ecosystem redistributes this potential marketing value from advertising giants to users who provide growth value for projects. By funneling marketing value back into its ecosystem, the $COOKIE token, its proprietary off- and on-chain analytics engine, and its data layer allow for a deep understanding of the user journey, enabling it to determine value-driving users deserving of rewards.

Using advanced AI to analyze unique behavioral characteristics, Cookie3 distinguishes between quality users, bots, or Sybil attackers to ensure that rewards go to engaged audiences rather than malicious actors trying to exploit the Web3 economy.

“Digital advertising has historically enriched Big Tech players like Google and Facebook, who earned hundreds of billions in ad revenues in 2023,” says Ilan Rakhmanov, CEO and Founder of ChainGPT. “Cookie3 entered our accelerator program as a mature project, and we were quite impressed with their product listing, business model, and overall mission to slash Big Tech’s exploitation of digital ads. ChainGPT Pad is quite selective regarding projects we wish to launch, accelerate, or incubate, and our team immediately recognized Cookie3’s creativity and disruptive potential, deciding to collaborate with Cookie3’s partner Cookie DAO in terms of $COOKIE IDO. We see them as a crucial Web3 building block and a valuable asset to the ChainGPT Pad.”

“We’ve dedicated over two years of research on pure R&D before we decided that the Cookie3 technology is ready to accommodate a token. We came into a partnership with Cookie DAO after releasing our Cookie3 Analytics platform that was a testament to the quality and reliability of our off- and on-chain analytics and AI tooling. The Cookie DAO-powered $COOKIE token, perfectly completes our solution, helping to capture and redistribute marketing value among the people who truly believe in MarketingFi,” said Filip Wielanier, the CEO and Co-founder of Cookie3. “We are driven by a vision of fair value exchange and redistribution of marketing budgets within our MarketingFi economy to quality users. We are proud of our multi platform ecosystem and having ChainGPT support the Cookie ecosystem in reaching the right audiences in such a crucial moment for MarketingFi.”
