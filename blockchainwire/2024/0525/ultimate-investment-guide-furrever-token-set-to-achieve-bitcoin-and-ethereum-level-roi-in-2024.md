How Did Ethereum Price React After Approval: Has the Expected Rise Come?Following the approval of eight spot Ethereum ETFs by the SEC last night, ETH price remained stagnant at $3,800 and showed no signs of a significant uptrend. Despite this, ETH experienced a significant increase of over 30% last week. Investors are currently taking a cautious stance and are watching to see if this development will result in a “news sell” event.

Ahead of the US SEC announcing its Ethereum ETF approval decision, ETH price witnessed some sharp fluctuations. In the tense hours before official approval, ETH initially fell to $3,500 during the traditional US market close. It later approached $3,900 after initial unconfirmed reports emerged pointing to confirmation, and ultimately settled above $3,800 after confirmation. In the midst of these huge price swings, it turned out that a whale made a staggering sale of 7,900 ETH worth $29 million.

During the turbulent period, liquidation of leveraged crypto derivatives positions reached over $350 million throughout the day, the highest figure since May 1, according to CoinGlass data. The majority of these liquidated positions were long positions anticipating price increases and totaled approximately $250 million. This shows that traders who had overextended themselves with leverage were surprised by the sudden price drop. Among those affected, ETH traders bore the brunt, with $132 million in liquidations.

Approval of spot Ethereum ETFs could bring inflows of more than $500 million, as analysts estimate. However, it may take some time for this to happen and the uptrend to begin. Some on-chain indicators suggest that Ethereum could form a base above $4,000 and continue to rise to $5,000-6,000 by August this year. While the approval of Bitcoin ETFs has led to strong institutional inflows, it will be interesting to see whether the ETH ETF launch will lead to greater institutional adoption.
