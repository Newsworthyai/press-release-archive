# Sameer Group LLC Raises $5 Million Investment Round to Champion Women-Led Memecoins on Solana

Sameer Group LLC, a Dubai-based venture capital & real-estate firm, has announced a $5 million investment round aimed at empowering women-led memecoins on the Solana blockchain. This funding, set to roll out from mid-November 2024 to January 2025, will back three pioneering tokens: $WYAC, #RETARDIA, and $MOTHER—each led by women who are making a mark in the blockchain and crypto communities.

This initiative aligns with Sameer Group LLC’s ongoing mission to drive diversity and elevate female representation within the blockchain space. The three women-led Solana projects exemplify the leadership, influence, and community focus that women are bringing to the Solana ecosystem and crypto on a broader level:

$WYAC: Arguably the single most recognizable cat meme on the internet, $WYAC is led by @TaylorArmstrong, the original face of the viral meme. An A-list celebrity in her own right, Taylor serves as the project’s lead developer and has built a devoted community through her direct engagement and leadership.

$MOTHER: This token is spearheaded by iconic singer Iggy Azalea, who has been actively involved since day one in the project. Iggy’s passion for her project shines through in her frequent events, personal engagement, and steadfast commitment to the $MOTHER community.

#RETARDIA: A trailblazer as Solana’s first female-led CTO project, #RETARDIA has already seen remarkable growth, securing significant backing from high-profile investors like GG1nvestments  (x.com/GG1nvestments) along with Sameer Group. #RETARDIA is a testament to the strength of women in technical leadership roles within blockchain, driving innovation and establishing new standards for the Solana ecosystem.

In addition to its financial backing, Sameer Group LLC will donate 5% of all profits from these investments to a breast cancer charity, selected through a community vote on Twitter/X. This reflects the firm’s dedication to impactful causes and community empowerment, giving investors and supporters an opportunity to participate in meaningful charitable contributions.

Leveraging its strategic partnership with the Solana Foundation and connections to top-tier exchanges, Sameer Group LLC is uniquely positioned to maximize the reach and impact of these women-led tokens. This round not only fuels the financial growth of these projects but reinforces Sameer Group’s vision of a blockchain industry where gender equality and inclusivity are celebrated.
