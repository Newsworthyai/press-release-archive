# MicroVisionChain Celebrates First Anniversary: Mainnet Launch and F2pool Listing of SPACE

MicroVisionChain (MVC), a high-performance Bitcoin layer 2 chain, is celebrating its first anniversary since the mainnet launch. MVC, which utilizes UTXO and PoW consensus, is renowned for its high performance, low fees, and decentralization. Its native coin, SPACE, is a top 3 PoW chain in terms of hash rate and uses the same SHA256d mining algorithm as Bitcoin, making Bitcoin ASICs usable for mining space.![](https://api.blockchainwire.io/uploads/MKdigiworld/editor_image/45ae86f6-cf1d-4e5f-9205-7ddeee6dada3.jpg)
