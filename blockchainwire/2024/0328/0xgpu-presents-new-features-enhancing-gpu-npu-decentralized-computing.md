# 0xGPU Presents New Features Enhancing GPU&NPU Decentralized Computing

The 0xGPU team is launching new features to enhance decentralized computing using GPU and NPU technologies.

With a clear set of milestones, 0xGPU offers different pricing plans to access high-performance GPUs when needed. The project will feature partnerships and cross-chain integration for a fully functional marketplace.

New Features Enhancing GPU&NPU Decentralized Computing0xGPU proposes new features to enhance GPU and NPU decentralized computing. These features aim to exploit the power of GPUs for accelerated AI training and inference. At the same time, the project will also provide additional benefits for users participating in the ecosystem.

The first key feature is its GPU-centric computing approach, which allows for the parallel processing of complex AI tasks. This can benefit research institutions by speeding up their progress in AI development.

Another major feature is the implementation of revenue-sharing. The system incentivizes users to stake tokens and earn passive income while contributing to the network's computational power.

With efficient memory management, AI models can access necessary resources for optimal performance. This benefits businesses by enabling real-time processing of large datasets.

Integrating storage disks allows for secure management of AI data sets and files. This is especially useful for industries like healthcare, where large amounts of sensitive data are involved.

Establishing private networks ensures secure communication and data transfer between network nodes. This is valuable for industries such as financial institutions that handle confidential information.

Allocating IPv4 addresses allows seamless integration with existing networking infrastructure. Manufacturing companies can use this feature to implement AI-powered predictive maintenance systems.

Overall, these new features will enhance 0xGPU's decentralized computing capabilities. This makes it a nice solution for businesses looking to introduce GPUs and NPUs in their AI development processes.

Different Pricing Plans and a Clear Set of Milestones AheadThe 0xGPU project comes with several pricing plans, as summarized below:

* NVIDIA H200 - 0.52 ETH per month for 24GB of max memory
* NVIDIA H100 - 0.44 ETH per month for 24GB of max memory
