A Bitcoin DeFi Solution: BitSmiley’s Overcollateralized Stablecoin and Lending ProtocolBitSmiley aims to reshape the Bitcoin ecosystem by offering BTC holders the ability to mint bitUSD, an overcollateralized stablecoin that provides real DeFi utility within the Bitcoin network. By combining the foundational DeFi infrastructures of MakerDAO (DAI) and Compound (Lending), BitSmiley launches three main products: bitUSD (an overcollateralized stablecoin), bitLending (a trustless lending protocol), and Credit Default Swaps (CDS), a unique derivatives protocol. This platform fills a significant gap in Bitcoin’s ecosystem by enabling stablecoins and lending, a vital addition for BTC holders seeking secure, transparent, and efficient DeFi solutions.

Empowering the Community through SMILE Token Utility and GovernanceSMILE, BitSmiley’s governance token, empowers its holders to participate in the platform’s decentralized governance by adjusting key parameters like collateral types and loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. Additionally, SMILE holders gain access to unique benefits such as surplus auction participation, fee discounts, and priority liquidation rights. With a total supply of 210 million tokens, SMILE is allocated across various groups to incentivize community involvement and sustainable platform growth. The token distribution includes allocations for early investors, user incentives, staking rewards, and liquidity, with an initial 12.76% release at TGE (Token Generation Event).

Building the Future of Bitcoin DeFi with Robust BTC Layer2 PartnershipsBitSmiley is strategically positioned to expand its DeFi services across multiple BTC Layer2 solutions, with bitUSD initially launching on its first Layer2 partner. The protocol’s over-collateralization mechanism, similar to MakerDAO, enables users to mint bitUSD by collateralizing BTC through wrapped BTC on Layer2 networks or via BitSmiley’s official bridge. This robust ecosystem extends beyond stablecoins and lending, incorporating insurance and CDS derivatives to provide a holistic DeFi solution for BTC holders. With the support of prominent investors like OKX Ventures, ABCDE, KuCoin Ventures, and MH Ventures, BitSmiley is set to broaden the adoption of Bitcoin within the DeFi landscape.
