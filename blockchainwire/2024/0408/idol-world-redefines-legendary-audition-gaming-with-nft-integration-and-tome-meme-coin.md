$TOME appearance with the huge wave of meme coins.Meme coins, which have been part of the cryptocurrency scene since Dogecoin's creation in 2015 and its popularity peak in 2020-2021, are now gaining more attention. This is because they're easy to access, simple to make, and generate excitement for speculative trading in the cryptocurrency market.

However, meme coins have been linked to controversial or offensive content, raising doubts about their legitimacy and usefulness. Moreover, they often need more practical value beyond speculative trading, leading some to question their worth.

In response to the rising interest in meme coins and to address these concerns, Idol World plans to introduce its own primary currency, the $TOME meme coin.

Unlike typical meme coins, $TOME serves as one of the main currencies within Idol World, granting users access to various attractive services and promoting the sustainable growth of the entire ecosystem.

"We create a project that actually makes a positive impact, not just attracts users for the sake of it. $TOME tends to be a good meme coin that supports good causes, focusing on leveraging an appealing gaming experience that everyone can enjoy", commented the founder of Idol World.
