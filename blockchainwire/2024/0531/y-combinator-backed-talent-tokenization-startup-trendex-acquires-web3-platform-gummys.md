# Y Combinator-backed Talent Tokenization Startup Trendex acquires Web3 platform Gummys

Trendex, the leading European company in athlete tokenization, backed by Y Combinator, is excited to embark on a new phase of its development. Having raised over $4 million from European and Asian investors, including Real Madrid’s "Ballon d’Or" winner and international football star Karim Benzema, and built a community of nearly 100,000 customers across Europe, Trendex is now focusing on the U.S. market. The company has recently announced partnerships with NBA stars Marcus Smart of the Grizzlies and Rudy Gobert of the Timberwolves, both NBA Defensive Players of the Year, to accelerate its expansion in the U.S. Additionally, Trendex has strategically acquired Gummys, an innovative decentralized video and streaming platform, in order to expand from sports to e-sports and YouTubers.

Over 200 talents are already available for you to trade."Gummys: The Streamers & Creators Powerhouse Joins the Trendex FamilyWith the goal of extending its services to content creators and streamers, Trendex has recently completed the acquisition of Gummys, a platform that has quickly taken the gaming community by storm. Co-founded by serial entrepreneurs Pasquale Sorrentino and Eunice Wong, Gummys has already garnered a viral following, attracting nearly half a million users across its social media channels. The platform's innovative decentralized approach, which has been recognized at Chainlink, Polygon, and Filecoin hackathons, provides users with a unique space to discover new YouTubers, gaming streamers and games, connect with them, and earn rewards.

A Winning Combination: Talent, Technology, and CommunityThis acquisition signifies a critical step for Trendex. Gummys' cutting-edge decentralized streaming technology will seamlessly integrate with Trendex’s existing talent tokenization platform. This synergy will enhance user engagement, content delivery, and social media interaction, propelling both platforms into a new era of digital content and community building.

Beyond Athletes: Tokenizing Creators with Gummys' TechnologyWith over 250 established athletes, artists, musicians, influencers, and actors already part of the Trendex family, the Gummys acquisition unlocks exciting possibilities for creators beyond the sports and entertainment worlds.

Leveraging Gummys' technology, Trendex will introduce a revolutionary new service: Tokenizing creators such as YouTubers and allowing their audience to share in their success. This is made possible by Gummy’s unique tech which will allow creators to:

* Own their content (leveraging on-chain metadata)
* Share revenue directly with their audience
* Benefit from community-regulated censorship and incentivized engagement

This innovative approach will redefine talent monetization, allowing creators to build sustainable careers and connect with fans on a deeper level. This aligns perfectly with Trendex's mission of helping talents in their careers while connecting with their fans in new, rewarding ways.
