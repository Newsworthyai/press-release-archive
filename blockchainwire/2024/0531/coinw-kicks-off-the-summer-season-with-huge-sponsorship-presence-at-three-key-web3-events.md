With all three events taking place within a few weeks of each other, it marks a pivotal period in CoinW’s advances to inject its resources into the expansion of the CeFi and DeFi realms.

CoinW kicks off their presence in Texas, placing a booth in the main registration area of Coindesk Consensus. During the three day event, they will also continue their Expedition Trek series, which kicked off in Dubai back in March, and continued on to Hong Kong in April. With the aim of facilitating meaningful dialogue with the Web3 ecosystem, the third installment in Texas will feature key speakers from government entities, regulators, industry leaders, and other renowned experts.

CoinW’s 150m walkway at Money 20/20 (4th - 6th June) will engage audiences with one-of-a-kind football-themed challenges to propel their [significant partnership with Andrea Pirlo](https://cointelegraph.com/news/this-exchange-signed-soccer-legend-andrea-pirlo-as-global-ambassador-to-celebrate-sixth-anniversary).
