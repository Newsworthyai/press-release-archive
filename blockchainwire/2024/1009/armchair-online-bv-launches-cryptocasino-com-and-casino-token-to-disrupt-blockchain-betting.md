# Armchair Online BV Launches CryptoCasino.com and $CASINO Token to Disrupt Blockchain Betting

Armchair Online BV, an experienced online gaming firm, are ready  to revolutionize the world of blockchain gambling with their groundbreaking  CryptoCasino.com platform and $CASINO token.

Led by an experienced team that has built multiple successful iGaming operations in the  world of sports betting, poker, and affiliate services, CryptoCasino.com will deliver an  unmatched betting experience for crypto users.

A World-Class Crypto Casino

Partnering with the largest gaming studios in the world, CryptoCasino will feature over  6,000 online slots and table games, a live dealer casino, premium sportsbook, eSports  betting hub, racebook, and more, all available to be bet on with 25+ of the largest  cryptocurrencies in the world.

To cater to the future of crypto betting, the site will allow for both traditional registration  and Web3 connectivity. By connecting instantly with wallets such as MetaMask or Trust  Wallet, players can seamlessly deposit and withdraw funds within seconds.

With a player-first focus, the site also includes 24/7 live chat support and an industry leading VIP program that offers a wide range of loyalty incentives that reward players on a  daily basis.

Set to Be the World’s #1 Telegram Casino

CryptoCasino is catering to the over one billion unique Telegram users by building a  Telegram Casino integration that allows anybody to immediately join and begin playing  with just one click.

With Telegram gaming growing rapidly, CryptoCasino’s integration with the platform will  offer a direct connection to millions of players around the world. The integration will  provide the perfect blend of security, seamless connectivity, and social gaming that can  rapidly grow into one of the best domains in online gaming today.

The $CASINO Token Offers Benefits to Holders and Players

To complement the launch of the CryptoCasino.com betting platform, the business is also  launching an ERC20 token called $CASINO that will serve as the basis of the ecosystem.

With the $CASINO token sale launching October 15 at token.cryptocasino.com, buyers will  be able to purchase their tokens directly from the secure Web3 sale site by connecting  their wallets.

There are several benefits to buying and holding $CASINO tokens.

Buy Back and Burn: Each month, 50% of the net profits from CryptoCasino.com will be  used to purchase $CASINO tokens from the open market. They will then be burned,  decreasing supply and creating scarcity for the token.

Staking Rewards: Holders will be able to stake their $CASINO tokens each month for an  APY up to 10%, allowing them to gain a passive income stream directly through the staking  platform found on the site.

Exclusive Player Bonuses and Airdrops: Holders will be able to use their $CASINO tokens  on the CryptoCasino platform to receive incentives such as a 200% deposit bonus, 15%  cashback on bets made, and much more.

Partnerships with the Best in the Industry

Having grown several iGaming businesses over the past two decades, the CryptoCasino  team understands that the key to rapid growth comes from partnerships with trusted  names in the online gaming business.

That is why CryptoCasino has partnered with several major names in betting and  blockchain including Pragmatic Play, Evolution Gaming, Betby, Oddin.gg, Decubate,  Covey, Fireblocks, and others.

As a fully licensed platform under Curacao and Anjouan gaming authorities, the platform  will provide the highest level of player safety and security, complying with all regulatory  statutes for the best crypto betting experience possible.

$CASINO Token Sale and CryptoCasino Platform Launching Soon

The $CASINO token sale will begin on October 15, with a special VIP round available to  those using a password that can be found on the social channels found below.  Unrestricted access will be available to all on October 17.

The CryptoCasino.com platform will be launching on November 19th for both the online  and Telegram casinos.
