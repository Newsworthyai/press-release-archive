# Invest in your travel experience and more with DeTrip

DeTrip Network is reshaping the travel industry by introducing a Web3 platform tailored for crypto enthusiasts. Imagine platforms like Booking, Trip, Expedia, or Hotels—but with a crypto-friendly twist. DeTrip currently offers access to over 2.5 million hotels worldwide and accepts payments in more than 160 cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, USDT, and USDC. For those who prefer traditional methods, it also supports over 16 fiat payment options like Visa, Mastercard, Alipay, WeChat Pay, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.

Price-conscious travelers will be pleased to find that DeTrip often provides significant savings compared to major booking platforms. In many European cities, DeTrip's hotel prices are generally 10-25% cheaper, frequently outperforming competitors like Booking.

Spend too much money on travel? Now you can earn it back with DeTrip.

Earning While Booking

What sets DeTrip apart is its generous cashback program. The platform offers up to 5% cashback on any booking made through its service. For instance, if you book a three-night stay in Amsterdam for €500, you'll receive €25 worth of cryptocurrency as a reward. These cashback rewards are distributed in stablecoins like USDC, the MoFi token, and other tokens from premium partners.

The flexibility doesn't end there. Travelers can use these tokens to pay for future bookings, offering more versatility than traditional hotel loyalty points. Unlike conventional point systems that lock you into a specific platform or hotel chain, DeTrip's crypto rewards can be traded on secondary markets or held as an investment, potentially increasing in value over time.

A Glimpse into the Future

The DeTrip team has hinted at exciting developments on the horizon, including but not limit to anonymous booking, hotel listing feature, P2P payment etc. Originating from the MobiFi project, they currently utilize the $MoFi token as part of their rewards system. However, plans are underway to introduce a new token designed to better fit their expanding ecosystem. Unverified sources suggest that this new token will not only enhance the value of the current $MoFi token—allowing for a 1:1 swap for existing users—but also create broader utility within the travel industry.

Accolades and Recognition

DeTrip's innovative approach hasn't gone unnoticed. The team recently received two prestigious awards at the ETHGlobal Hackathon in Brussels: the Best ZK dApp from Polygon and the Most Creative Use Case from Worldcoin for their unique anonymous booking solution.

Conclusion

Traveling doesn't have to drain your finances anymore. With DeTrip, you can explore the world while earning crypto assets, turning your travel expenses into potential investments. As the platform continues to evolve, it stands poised to offer even more value to travelers worldwide.
