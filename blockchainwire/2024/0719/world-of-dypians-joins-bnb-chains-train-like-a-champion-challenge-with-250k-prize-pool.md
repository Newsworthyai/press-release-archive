The BNB Chain campaign will run from July 24 to August 14, at the same time as the Olympics, and should help participating projects boost awareness and community ranks. World of Dypians joins the event with its own campaign, “Dypians' Global Challenge,” and expects more than 300,000 users to participate. The WOD team commented on the upcoming event:

“We’re happy to share that World of Dypians is part of the "Train Like a Champion Challenge" campaign run by BNB Chain. We are confident that this campaign will boost our on-chain activity and social media engagement, especially before TGE.”

BNB Chain’s "Train Like a Champion" Challenge

The "Train Like a Champion" challenge is an exciting opportunity for participants in the BNB Chain ecosystem. Contestants must complete tasks to earn points any time between July 24, 2024, 00:00 UTC and August 14, 2024, 23:59 UTC. Here are the participation rules:

1. Users must connect their wallets on Dappbay.
2. They must create an Olympic-themed AI NFT powered by Limewire, ChainGPT, and NFTPrompt.
3. Users have to engage in the Loyalty, Champion, and DeFi Challenges via the participating projects. By completing tasks, they can earn experience points (XP) and enhance their AI NFTs.
4. The top performers will share the $250,000+ prize pool.

The rewards for the “Train Like a Champion” challenge will be distributed as follows:

* Leaderboard rewards: The top 5000 leaderboard positions will share the $250,000+ prize pool according to the reward list.
* Participants with a minimum of 500 XP will enter a $10,000 raffle for an additional 100 lucky draw prizes.

The organizers specified that participants could only receive one type of reward (leaderboard or raffle). As a result, leaderboard reward winners are ineligible for the raffle reward. Also, if performers qualify for both rewards, they will be prioritized for the leaderboard prize.

In the case of an XP tie between two or more participants, the final rankings will be determined by the earliest completion of the final task. If the tie persists, priority will be given to the earliest minting of the Olympic-themed AI NFT. The minting times for NFTs are available on BSCscan.

Lastly, the participating projects will distribute the rewards to the winners' wallet addresses within two weeks after the campaign ends.
