The first game studio from Estonia to join WEMIX PLAY, Gerillaz OÜ has designed World of the Abyss (WOTA) as a true hardcore MMORPG with a vast seamless open world that offers an exciting gameplay experience layered with innovative features and engaging game mechanics.

World of the Abyss features a balanced Player vs Player system that offers an engaging competitive experience, as well as massive multiplayer support for up to 15,000 players on a single server for truly epic gameplay experiences. This means that real-time PVP battles involving up to 15,000 players at a single location can happen anytime, anywhere directly on the multi-level map. A special “TARGET LOCK” & interactive combat system, and a well-thought-out system of battles with a large set of unique skills empowers players to use their own strategy and tactics to achieve victory over their opponents even in the most difficult situations.

Other key features include autoplay-free mechanics which give players total control over their in-game actions and the game’s unique class system. Players can experience all four character classes - Berserker, Archer’s Ghost, Ice Lord, and Saint’s Ambassador - just by using and switching to different weapons.

The game features a peer-to-peer marketplace for in-game items and integrated various Web3 mechanics to deliver novel gaming experiences like Play2Own and minting NFTs for players to own and trade in-game assets. Game NFTs will be available on Drops, WEMIX PLAY’s dedicated platform for NFT auctions, once World of the Abyss is launched on WEMIX PLAY.
