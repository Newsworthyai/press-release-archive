# Raiinmaker Announces Launch of Native Token $COIIN on Base

Raiinmaker, a Web3 and AI Technology Company, today announced that its initial IDO for the $COIIN token on Tenset sold out in just 29 seconds and a second IDO on Poolz two days later also sold out. More IDOs are planned for the month of April, leading up to the TGE of its native token, $COIIN.

Raiinmaker has chosen to launch $COIIN on the Base Network.

“Raiinmaker and BASE share a commitment to building technology and products that prioritize seamless user experience and frictionless onboarding to enable the mass adoption of Web3 and decentralized AI. With the first successful IDO for $COIIN and the existing community in the Raiinmaker ecosystem, we are set to bridge over 100,000 new users onto BASE,” said J.D. Seraphine, Founder and CEO of Raiinmaker.

Over 70,000 Raiinmaker Super App users train AI right from their iOS or Android phones and earn fractional rewards based on the value of their contributions to decentralized AI models and infrastructure. With over 50,000 wallets claimed on the Raiinmaker Network, now everyone has the ability to train AI models and run a DePIN enabled validator node using just their smartphone from anywhere in the world.

"Reaching these major milestones demonstrates the growing adoption of our human-powered AI network. With millions of transactions secured by our vast network of nodes, and $COIIN tokens distributed to validators and app users, the Raiinmaker Network is establishing itself as a leading platform for decentralized AI and a new generation of Web3 applications," Seraphine remarked.

The Raiinmaker Network Protocol is scaling to onboard major enterprise partners in Sports, Entertainment and Gaming in Q3 2024 as well as the deployment of upgraded AI compute power in Q4 2024.

With over 18 million transactions processed and an engaged community of over 200,000 worldwide, Raiinmaker empowers people all over the planet to contribute to decentralized AI infrastructure while earning crypto, no special technical knowledge required.

Raiinmaker plans its mainnet launch for late April and has a testnet validator airdrop ending soon that people can still claim at https://www.raiinmaker.com/airdrop.
