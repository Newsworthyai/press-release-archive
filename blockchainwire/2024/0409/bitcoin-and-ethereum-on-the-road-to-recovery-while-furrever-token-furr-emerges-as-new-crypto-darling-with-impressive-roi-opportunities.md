Bitcoin Surges 2.5% to $69,824 - Is $80,000 Imminent or Will $60,000 Support Hold Strong?In the latest market evaluation, prominent crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades highlighted Bitcoin's sustained presence near the highest levels of the 2021 cycle for approximately four weeks. This endurance prompts a closer examination of its significance.

Bitcoin's current price stands at approximately $69,824, reflecting a notable increase of 2.5% since yesterday. Historically, Bitcoin tends to linger near cycle peaks for about 1-2 months before price movements resume. This stagnant phase, which began before the halving period, doesn't seem entirely illogical when viewed through the lens of historical data.

On the flip side, shallow pullbacks signal positivity within the upward trend. Bitcoin consolidates at lower levels while evading deeper troughs, essentially gathering momentum for new highs. Several triggers contribute to this phenomenon, such as Genesis selling its billion-dollar GBTC shares and consistently negative inflation data over the past two months.

Highlighting the previous bull market cycle between 2019 and late 2021, Glassnode's Checkmate analyst noted Bitcoin experienced two corrections exceeding 50%. However, current retracements are milder, fueling optimism for the ongoing phase. Buyers and sellers maintain price equilibrium, with neither side emerging victorious as no breakthrough beyond $60,000 or $73,777 has occurred yet. Moreover, the formation of a symmetrical triangle on the chart indicates an impending breakout, signaling potential volatility across BTC and the broader crypto market.

If the symmetrical triangle breaks downward, a return to $54,298 support following $60,000 is anticipated. Conversely, breaching $73,777 could propel Bitcoin towards the $80,000 mark, painting a dynamic picture of future price action.

Ethereum Recovered 1.5%: Navigating Key Levels Amidst SEC Decisions and ETF Sentiment ShiftsThe current price of Ethereum (ETH) stands at approximately $3,386, marking a modest increase of 1.5% since yesterday. However, the optimism surrounding spot Ethereum ETF funds in the crypto market took a downturn with recent decisions by the SEC, leading to a shift towards a more pessimistic sentiment. Consequently, this development has hindered the upward momentum in Ethereum's price.

In particular, the resistance formed around the $4,000 level continues to pose a significant obstacle to Ethereum's price movement. Key support levels to monitor on the daily chart include $3,274, $3,149, and $3,030. Notably, the $3,274 level has served as crucial support in recent days, and a daily close below this level could signal a loss of momentum for Ethereum's price.

Conversely, important resistance levels to watch on the daily chart are $3,420, $3,664, and $3,931. A daily close above the $3,420 level, especially intersecting with the EMA 9 level, could catalyze a renewed momentum for Ethereum's price, potentially leading to further gains.

In summary, Ethereum's price currently faces resistance near the $4,000 level, with the SEC's decisions regarding spot Ethereum ETF funds dampening market sentiment. Key support and resistance levels on the daily chart offer valuable insights for traders and investors to navigate Ethereum's price movements amidst the evolving market dynamics.
