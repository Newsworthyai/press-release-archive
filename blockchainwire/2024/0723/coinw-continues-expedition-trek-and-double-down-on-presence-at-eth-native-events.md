It’s an unignorable ecosystem that will continue to make waves in the technological advancement of our world, and ultimately persist in feeding the overall growth of DeFi. When we got the chance to sponsor such a vibrant initiative with genuinely meaningful purpose behind it, it was a no brainer. We’re thrilled to be able to have an impact.”CoinW’s immersion at EDCON comes shortly after their trip to EthCC Brussels, where they were actively present in hosting the enriching BXL Mastermind Meetup side event alongside [Swissborg](https://swissborg.com/en-gb) and [Aethir](https://aethir.com/).
