What is Lufina and what does it solve?

Lufina deploys real estate tokenization, pertaining to the process wherein an asset is

divided into numerous NFT digital tokens, each of which symbolizes the underlying

property along with its associated rights and obligations. The purpose of smart

contracts is to establish contractual particulars that are transparent and immutable.

Coupled with publicly available legal documents, it creates an immutable and

transparent record of ownership and rights.

What are the highlights of Lufina ?

Reducing High Upfront Payment Requirements：Lufina disrupts the pattern of high initial capital requirements by allowing individuals to start building an international real estate portfolio with as little as $50 USD. By democratizing access to real estate investment, Lufina minimizes the financial barrier to entry, making it feasible for a broader range of investors.

Overcoming Good Credit Requirements： Traditionally, the purchase of a property must be funded with the full purchase price of the property, which is not available to most of us. Therefore, bank loans must be used to make these purchases, but buyers must meet rigid credit requirements to access these bank loans. Lufina's model eliminates the rigid credit requirements often associated with real estate investments.

Enhancing Liquidity and Efficiency： Functioning as a marketplace, Lufina mitigates the challenge of real estate illiquidity. The platform hosts property listings from diverse sources, including real estate agents, turnkey providers, wholesalers, and home flippers. In turn, this diversity of listings enhances market liquidity, offering a broad range of properties that can be bought or sold efficiently compared to traditional methods, potentially reducing the time required to find suitable buyers or sellers.

Transparency and Accessibility to Data: Lufina promotes transparency by mandating appraisals, signed purchase agreements and legal contracts for properties listed on its platform. It provides public access to this data, enabling investors to make informed decisions. As a domino effect, the accrued transparency builds trust and confidence among investors since they have access to critical information before committing to an investment.

Conclusion

Step by step, Lufina breaks down traditional barriers in the real estate sector, rendering investment more accessible, transparent, and fluid. Lufina transcends mere market participation. The primary objective is to disrupt and challenge the established conventions of real estate investment, thereby enabling a wide array of investors to participate in the market. Sustained by innovation and technological precision, Lufina maintains a critical position in this sector's anticipated $10 trillion expansion by 2030 in a more equitable and inclusive manner. Lufina represents a partnership in progress rather than merely a platform for prospective investors and stakeholders: an opportunity to contribute to a community that places high importance on innovation, transparency, and inclusiveness.
