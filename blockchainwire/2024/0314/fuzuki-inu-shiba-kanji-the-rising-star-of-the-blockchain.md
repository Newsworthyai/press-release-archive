Fuzuki Inu is about to start an exciting journey that will mark key milestones in the world of cryptocurrencies. The project's open sale, which begins in March, is the first step in building a strong community and attracting early investors. As Fuzuki Inu grows, April marks a watershed point with the listing of its currencies on Centralized Exchanges (CEX), opening the way for increased accessibility and visibility in the cryptocurrency market. Looking ahead to September, the project will expand into decentralized finance (DeFi) with the launch of its Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and the introduction of a new coin called Skulk.

Fuzuki's innovative strategy allocates 95% of resources to the Launch Pool, which increases community engagement and participation while retaining 5% for CEX listing. It is clear that Fuzuki is committed to promoting inclusion and long-term growth through this strategic move.

The cost of each coin is exceptionally low, at only $0.000000001, allowing a wide spectrum of people to participate right away. Rather than seeking financing from large investors, Fuzuki Inu promotes a community-focused strategy, welcoming anyone interested in joining this innovative initiative.

Fuzuki Inu runs much like a collaborative team project, with all members working together to achieve success. The idea is based on the principle that togetherness strengthens us, creating an environment in which cooperation takes precedence over individual endeavors.
