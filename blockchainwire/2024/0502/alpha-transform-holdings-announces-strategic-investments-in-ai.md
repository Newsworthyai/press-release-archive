The pair have stood up a joint AI and Data foundry in Frisco, Texas housing some of the brightest machine learning engineers, data scientists, data architects, and dApp developers from top universities such as Cornell University, Duke University, University of California, and University of Texas.

A report from MarketsAndMarkets said that the global artificial intelligence market size was valued at USD 150.2 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 36.8% from 2023 to 2030. The revenue forecast for 2030 is projected to reach $1,345.2 billion.

Enzo Villani, CEO of Alpha Transform Holdings, stated, "Given our strong focus on AI and Web3 technologies, as well as the $1 trillion-plus market potential in AI services, our goal has been to create a comprehensive, world class AI and Web3 development capability for our portfolio clients and industry partners. This includes offering a diverse range of services such as AI strategy and implementation planning, algorithm design, and AI model and dApp development. Cloudbench and Arhasi will collaborate closely to act as a vital bridge between AI and Web3 development expertise and the evolving requirements of our clients, thus facilitating a seamless transition towards AI and Web3 adoption and product development."

Tom Richer, Founder of Cloudbench, added, "The future of the AI and Web3 services market looks promising. AI stands ready to revolutionize every industry and customer segment, becoming an essential asset for businesses globally.

Chiru Bhavansikar, Chief AI Officer of Arhasi, said, “Users trust powerful and dependable AI agents. We've noticed that the integration of AI agents is spreading across sectors like securities, banking, finance, and insurance, transforming various operational aspects. We see that AI is employed for customer interaction, investment protocols, and operational tasks across various industries. However, users are concerned about the lack of explainability, which could hinder the evaluation of the system's conceptual coherence. Nonetheless, we believe AI has the potential to streamline financial processes on Web3 platforms by effectively leveraging the synergies between these two technologies. With our strategic partner Cloudbench along with our innovative platforms and technologies, we are poised to instill enterprise AI integrity.”
