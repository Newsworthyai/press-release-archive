# Value Flow - A Crypto Services Ecosystem

What is Value Flow and what does it solve?

Value Flow is creating a Crypto Services Ecosystem that will be powered by the VFLOW Token. As the Crypto Industry evolves the opportunities that this market offers change constantly. No one can predict which is the next crypto services sector that will offer the best returns in the upcoming bull run. Furthermore, simplicity and accessibility remain two factors that can unlock a serious value inflow to the Crypto Market by people who now struggle to figure out how the crypto economy works.

Value Flow will offer a series of services such as: Futures Trading AI Bots, Security Token Offerings for Real World Assets tokenization, DeFi Smart Vaults, Crypto Lending, and Staking. The scope is to unify all these services under one roof so the VFLOW Holders can easily navigate and select the services that they wish to interact with. The range of services cover all crypto sectors so the users will be able to benefit from any of the services that boom during the next bull run.

The platform charges a 20% success fee for all profits that are generated using the services. The participation in membership means that the users of the platform have interests that are aligned with the platform developers, creating a community of shared interest in maintaining the platform and the token value.
