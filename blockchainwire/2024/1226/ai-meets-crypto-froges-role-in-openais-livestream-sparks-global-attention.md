# AI Meets Crypto: FROGE’s Role in OpenAI’s Livestream Sparks Global Attention

FROGE, the community-driven meme coin, is experiencing a meteoric rise in popularity following its unexpected inclusion in OpenAI’s #OpenAI12Days livestream series. The livestreams, which launched earlier this month, have featured FROGE-themed Easter eggs that have captivated audiences worldwide, igniting a frenzy of interest among crypto enthusiasts and beyond.

In just 24 hours after the livestream series debuted, FROGE’s market cap surged to unprecedented heights, reaching new all-time highs. This surge highlights the growing influence of the project, which combines the charm of meme culture with the power of blockchain innovation.

A Spotlight Moment with OpenAI

This isn’t the first time FROGE has captured the public’s imagination. Last year, FROGE imagery was spotted on the laptop of one of OpenAI’s co-founders in a New York Times feature, marking the project as an underground favorite within tech circles. Now, with its Easter egg appearances in OpenAI’s livestream series, FROGE is cementing its role as a cultural touchstone in both the crypto and AI communities.

The livestreams, set to conclude on December 20th, have provided an unprecedented platform for FROGE to showcase its creativity and community-driven ethos. As viewers hunt for Easter eggs, the project has gained momentum, attracting attention from new investors, developers, and enthusiasts alike.
