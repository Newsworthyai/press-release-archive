# SockCoin Announces Memecoin Listing on January 2 and Successful Solidproof Audit & KYC

SockCoin, an AI-powered memecoin, has announced several important developments, including official dates for its launch, token listings, and remarkable audit and KYC results from Solidproof. The project is in full-fledged progress. Notably, the team aims to build a decentralized ecosystem with staking, farming, airdrops, and other fun features for its rapidly growing community.

SockCoin's adventure started on December 23, 2024, when it launched its much-anticipated presale. The community-centered project plans to create a solid community where everyone gets plenty of "Socks" tokens. In fact, the team announced that 70% of the total supply of $SOCKS tokens is reserved for the community.

SockCoin will be listed on January 2, 2025, on P2B, one of the industry's top centralized exchanges. The memecoin has a lucrative business plan involving a large liquidity pool to take commissions on every BUY and SELL transaction within the SockCoin ecosystem. Building a massive liquidity pool will help the memecoin's value increase in the long run.

Another important development for SockCoin is its listing on DEXTools, the world's leading DeFi app for trading. This event will also take place on January 2, 2025. More importantly, it aligns with the project’s mission to deliver a fun DeFi experience within a secure, transparent, and trustworthy environment.

Both the listing on P2B and on DEXTools will involve massive airdrops to kick off 2025 in style.

Last but not least, SockCoin announced the successful completion of a smart contract audit and KYC verification for its team with Solidproof. This event marks a landmark occasion for SockCoin, increasing the project's credibility and authenticity. Solidproof is one of the industry's top auditors and a reliable gatekeeper. The German-based company even included SockCoin in its TrustNet database, which consists of rigorously checked, trustworthy projects.

SockCoin continues to build for a stellar future that should “take it to the moon.” The team announced that every transaction will involve rewards, burns, and guaranteed liquidity. Moreover, $SOCKS holders will become part of the SockArmy, a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) that will control the project’s future.
