The Past of BFG: What Does History Tell Us?The past always has consequences. Therefore, it is crucial to dig deeper and understand the origins of a project. BFG was created with the primary goals of platform profit sharing and providing passive earnings for its holders. Initially, users mined it by playing platform games. As the product developed, partnerships increased, providing additional utilities for the token and enhancing users’ income. In the summer of 2023, when BFG mining ended, the token became a resource with a limited supply. Monthly burnings and multiple events have contributed to the current rise in BFG's value.
