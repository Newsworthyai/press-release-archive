This year, WAGMI is partnering with Cointelegraph, the world’s leading blockchain media outlet, to deliver the most immersive and expansive Web3 and blockchain event in its history with the biggest names in the industry joining for an experience unlike any other.

Our mission has always been to bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds of crypto, and this partnership allows us to build a platform where the blockchain community can thrive. We’re excited to bring the Cointelegraph experience to life in a whole new way.” With 12.5 million unique readers per month, coverage in 11 languages, and partnerships with over 300 industry leaders including Metamask, Binance, and Ripple, Cointelegraph’s reach and influence make it a key player in elevating this event to a global world-class experience.
