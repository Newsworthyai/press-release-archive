# PNGVN The Value of 130 companies in ONE Token!

What is PNGVN and what does it solve?

GNGIM (Global NFT Group Investment Management) is contracted by GNG Community to manage part of their revenue within the PNGVN Token. GNGIM will manage the investments on behalf of the community and the structure will be similar to a fund. The investment areas are The NonFungible Token (NFT), Cryptocurrency market and Artificial intelligence (AI).

Although part of the revenue from the GNG community is transferred to the Token, the expected growth will come from high expectations in the “Funds” evolving markets. PNGVN aims to be the largest integrated Token in this market by 2026. By spreading our investments widely, we reduce the risk of the fund losing money.

Global NFT Group’s Investment Management role is to ensure that the investments are done properly after certain specifics are met. Our investments have a long-term perspective, enabling it to cope with big swings in value in the short term. Our goal as manager of the PNGVN on behalf of the GNG Community is to generate the highest possible return with only moderate risk so that the PNGVN grows and endures market cycle changes in the long run.

The PNGVN will be managed as an investment index fund in the NFT space, which will allow for lower investment Risk and potentially higher returns, by building a varied portfolio and spreading our Fund and ultimately any potential risk. Its investment strategy will be diversified across multiple NFTrelated projects and products.

- NFT: A major part of the investments will be allocated to Non-Fungible Token (NFT) companies and projects. Because NFTs are a rapidly evolving technology that has the potential to revolutionize many industries.

- AI: Parts of the investments will be allocated to Artificial Intelligence (AI) related projects and companies because we see a huge potential and future in this upcoming market.

- Crypto currency: Parts of the investments will be allocated to Crypto Currency because we see a huge potential and undervalue in a few established projects and coins.
