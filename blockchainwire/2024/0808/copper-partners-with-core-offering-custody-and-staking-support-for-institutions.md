# Copper Partners with Core, Offering Custody and Staking Support for Institutions

The Core Foundation, contributors to Core, a Bitcoin-powered blockchain unlocking EMV-Compatible BTCfi beginning with the first ever implementation of Non-Custodial BTC Staking, today announced it has entered into a strategic partnership with Copper, a leader in digital asset custody, collateral management and prime services. Copper will support the CORE token and staking activities.

Since being founded in 2018, Copper has been building the standard for institutional digital asset infrastructure with a focus on custody and collateral management. At the core of Copper’s infrastructure is ClearLoop, which enables clients to manage collateral and settle trades across multiple exchanges, while mitigating counterparty risk and increasing capital efficiency. Copper’s infrastructure will support the CORE token and staking, allowing Bitcoin and CORE to be staked directly from a custodial account, further mitigating counterparty risk. Thus, this partnership is a key step for Core in offering Non-Custodial BTC Staking to the institutional market.

"The institutional market especially is looking at new ways to maximize their Bitcoin investment and yield through a mechanism like the Non-Custodial BTC Staking offered by Core. We couldn’t ask for a better partner than Copper to help us in presenting a safe and secure means of providing this kind of investment to the institutional market, while also helping us to optimize the staking process,” said Rich Rines, Initial Contributor to Core.

Dmitry Tokarev, CEO at Copper.co commented, “Our new strategic partnership with Core contributes to the broader growth of secure connectivity. This integration further establishes institutional trust and provides our clients with greater accessibility.”
