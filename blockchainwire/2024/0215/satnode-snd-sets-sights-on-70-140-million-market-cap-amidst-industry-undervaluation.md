# SatNode (SND) Sets Sights on $70-140 Million Market Cap Amidst Industry Undervaluation

SatNode ($SND), a pioneering Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) project, valued at $2 million, announces its ambitious target of reaching a market capitalization between $70 to $140 million. This strategic move underscores SatNode's substantial growth potential and the current undervaluation in comparison to other Layer 1 (L1) projects.

As competitors like $SHIDO and $SAVM have achieved market caps of $111 million and $140 million respectively, SatNode's growth plan is both bold and feasible. Drawing inspiration from these successes, SatNode is determined to capitalize on its innovative blockchain solutions to achieve a comparable market valuation.

Focused on DPoS for Enhanced Blockchain Functionality and User Experience

SatNode is strategically positioned to utilize DPoS to enhance blockchain functionality and user experience. By leveraging this technology, SatNode is primed for rapid expansion and revaluation. The project is actively working to rectify its market positioning, highlighting the significant untapped potential within its platform.

"SatNode's Ambition Reflects its Potential in Blockchain Technology's Future"

The journey towards a revised market cap for SatNode is indicative of its potential to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of blockchain technology. SatNode's commitment to innovation and growth positions it as a key player in the evolving landscape of decentralized finance (DeFi).

"We believe that a fair valuation for SatNode lies in the range of $70-140 million. This viewpoint is informed by our technological advancements, market positioning, and the incredible potential we see in our project and community," said the SatNode Founder. "Our ambition reflects our confidence in SatNode's ability to deliver value and drive innovation in the blockchain space."

Unlocking Financial Inclusion and Innovation with SatNode

Launched in 2024 by a team of seasoned veterans from diverse DeFi backgrounds, SatNode introduces a revolutionary tiered FTN node system. With traditional financial systems often inaccessible to millions, particularly in developing countries, SatNode is pioneering a solution to enable swift and frictionless payments on a global scale. This system empowers businesses and communities by offering mobile-first tools, seamlessly integrating crypto services, and bridging the gap between traditional and digital finance.

In addition to its innovative node system, SatNode leverages a decentralized Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchain. This creates an environment that fosters permissionless innovation, allowing for a wide range of decentralized developments to thrive within the SatNode ecosystem.

SatNode's native currency, SND, plays a crucial role within its ecosystem by covering transaction fees and facilitating network governance through staking. SND's mildly inflationary model ensures predictable revenue flow for validators and delegators while keeping transaction fees low. Furthermore, SatNode's blockchain features rapid block confirmation times and minimal transaction costs, enabling efficient processing of up to 120 native token transactions and 60 TL20 token transactions per second, showcasing its scalability and effectiveness.

SatNode's strategic framework represents a significant step towards democratizing access to financial services globally, making digital finance universally accessible and user-friendly.
