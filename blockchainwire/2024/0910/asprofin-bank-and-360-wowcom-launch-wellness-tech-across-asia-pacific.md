# Asprofin Bank and 360 Wowcom Launch Wellness Tech Across Asia-Pacific

[Asprofin Bank](https://www.asprofinbank.org/)'s partnership with 360 Wowcom is poised to introduce advanced wellness and technology solutions across the Asia-Pacific region. This collaboration is not just significant, it's a game-changer. It's set to revolutionize health and technology access, enhance the quality of life for millions, and set new industry standards, ushering in a new era of possibilities.

Asprofin Bank, a global leader in financial services, announced its strategic partnership with 360 Wowcom, an emerging industry leader in data technologies and wellness products. Asprofin Bank's Yida Jiang commented, "The cooperation announced today aims to introduce comprehensive technology and wellness solutions throughout the Asia-Pacific region, overcoming key barriers to entry and empowering millions to improve their access to technology and quality of life."

Since its inception in 2013, Asprofin Bank, under the purview of the Financial Services Unit of the Commonwealth of Dominica, has been a financial institution licensed under Section 5 of the Oﬀshore Banking Act, No. 8 of 1996. The institution has provided a range of bespoke services to clients like 360 Wowcom, allowing them to overcome barriers to entry in critical economic and financial zones worldwide.

360 Wowcom's newest product showcase, 360 Wellness, is set to penetrate the ASEAN market. This product, among 37 technologies, features a 45 billion-grade unipolar active high-concentration high-purity micro-nano negative oxygen ion flow machine, which is designed to infuse negative ions into the body for improved disease recovery. The negative oxygen ions in 360 Wellness can rapidly reverse the cellular environment, awakening, enhancing, and stimulating cellular energy to achieve self-healing and immunity. This scientific validation underscores the effectiveness of our product, providing you with the assurance you need.

Further, a Super Energy Sound Wave process within the 360 Wellness Machine stimulates the cells within the patient's body, accelerating disease recovery and providing natural immunity. This process is in line with the findings by several journals which indicated the therapeutic nature of specific sound frequencies that directly correlate to an elevated rate of cell regeneration when subjects are exposed to the same.

When asked about market objectives, Guo Wei Zhen of 360 Wowcom said, "The product enhances human health and self-healing capabilities through multi-layered and multifaceted regulation and repair, ultimately achieving the goal of health and longevity."

In terms of plans, 360 Wowcom, with the synergistic efforts of Asprofin Bank, advised their bold plans to establish a global network of AI-driven supercomputing and quantum-enhanced data centers. DK Wei Chen of Asprofin Bank affirmed, "These data centers, with 360 Wowcom's proprietary quantum dot technology, will allow for data access at unprecedented speeds, making real-time global communication, AI research, and big data analytics a realistic possibility today."
