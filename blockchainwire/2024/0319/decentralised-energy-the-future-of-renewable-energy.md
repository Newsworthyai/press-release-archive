# Decentralised Energy: The Future of Renewable Energy

The push towards renewable energy has never been more crucial in a world grappling with climate urgencies and geopolitical flux. The quest for energy resilience is at the forefront of global discourse as nations seek to bolster their energy security against the backdrop of volatile gas prices, supply uncertainties, and the relentless march of climate change.

Central to this transformation is the advent of decentralised energy systems, particularly in electricity powered by renewables and advanced technology, promising a future where energy autonomy isn't just aspirational—it's achievable.

This shift brings a new era of energy networks, where the focus pivots from centralisation to localised, sustainable, and resilient power generation and distribution.

Understanding the Appeal of DecentralisationThe evolution of energy systems from centralised to decentralised models reflects transformative technological and social shifts.

Centralised grids, a staple since the post-war era, have capitalised on economies of scale with large-scale power plants at the core. Yet, today's energy landscape is witnessing a shift towards smaller, widespread renewable sources like personal solar arrays and community wind farms, thanks to the rise of renewable energy technology.

Smart grids are another technological leap, making the once-daunting management of decentralised networks feasible. Social movements advocating for greener, localised, and autonomous energy solutions further fuel this shift. These factors reshape the energy narrative, steering us towards a decentralised future where energy resilience, sustainability, and community empowerment take centre stage.

The Role of Smart Grids in Decentralised EnergySmart grids are crucial in transitioning to decentralised energy, changing our power generation and distribution approach. These advanced networks integrate distributed energy resources (DERs), such as microgrids and small-scale renewables, enhancing grid flexibility and fortifying energy resilience. Driven by goals to reduce carbon emissions and enhance energy security, the adoption of DERs is increasing, supported by falling costs and favourable policies.

Smart grids, with their intricate data flows, promise greater reliability and adaptability. They feature advanced technologies such as smart meters and systems that isolate faults, ensuring a stable and responsive energy network despite the intermittent nature of renewable sources.

A smart grid is an electricity network that combines the actions of all connected entities - generators, consumers, and those that can both generate and consume electricity. This creates a peer-to-peer network, streamlining electricity distribution and maintaining high-quality, secure supply. The peer-to-peer aspect of a smart grid eliminates intermediaries in energy trading, allowing more freedom in terms of preferences, choices, and pricing.

Modern research shows blockchain technology with smart contract capabilities can facilitate energy trading without a central trusted entity. Although some characteristics of smart grids are present in today's systems, a fully realised smart grid can solve complex issues more effectively, using intelligent monitoring, control, communication, and self-healing technologies. This advanced capability makes smart grids an integral part of the decentralised energy landscape.

Challenges in Smart Grid Implementation and Blockchain SolutionsImplementing smart grids is not without its challenges, notably achieving compatibility between diverse hardware and software systems. Creating an infrastructure for millions to trade in a unified energy market and ensuring energy traceability are significant hurdles.

Blockchain offers solutions to these challenges with its decentralised approach, ensuring data integrity and secure transactions. Its integration with IoT enhances smart grid resilience and efficiency. Blockchain's use in smart grids exemplifies a broader concept known as Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN). DePIN uses blockchain tokens to motivate communities, not corporations, to build physical infrastructure networks, covering sectors from mobility and electric vehicle charging to telecoms. This model has been around for years, but a unified understanding of its role in Web3 is now taking centre stage, showcasing blockchain's real-world applications beyond the energy sector. DePIN's emergence underlines blockchain's extensive potential in creating resilient, decentralised systems across various domains.

Rowan Energy's implementation of blockchain technology in smart grids, particularly with their Proof of Generation mechanism, is a prime example of DePIN's application in the renewable energy sector, leading the way in DecEnergy.

Rowan Energy: Creating the foundation for True Decentralised Energy (DecEnergy)Rowan Energy is shaping a carbon-neutral future by innovating using blockchain technology in the renewable energy sector. Their 'Proof of Generation' system prioritises energy creation, supporting net-zero objectives while reducing blockchain's environmental impact. The MID Certified SmartMiner, pivotal in Rowan's setup, acts as a smart meter and crypto miner, rewarding homeowners for generating renewable energy. Excess energy can be traded on a peer-to-peer platform, enhancing sustainable energy use.

Rowan's approach includes tokenising energy into NFT Carbon Offset Certificates, ensuring transparency in carbon credits. This method generates revenue and enables clients to effectively offset carbon emissions. Rowan's system uniquely generates real-time offset certificates at the site, maintaining data integrity and preventing fraud.

Managing over 1 MW of solar capacity in the UK, Rowan's partnership with ESE Group aims to distribute thousands of SmartMiners, indicating substantial growth. Their vision extends to the electric vehicle sector, intending to introduce energy certificates, marking a significant application of blockchain for environmental progress.

Rowan is enhancing its impact in the solar energy market. In collaboration with ESE Group, they're training installers for SmartMiner distribution, which is set to increase significantly by 2024. Future strategies involve partnerships for wider SmartMiner integration.

This positions Rowan as a leader in sustainable energy, committed to authenticity and transparency in green technology.

The Future of Energy is DecentralisedThe future of energy is decentralised, and smart grid technology is leading the change to a more sustainable, efficient, and reliable energy system. Integrating blockchain into smart grids ensures transactional integrity through immutability, meaning records can't be altered or erased. This assures that agreements, like those between energy producers and consumers, are consistently executed, providing reliability and traceability – essential for audits and resolving disputes.

Rowan Energy's blockchain, running on a Proof of Generation consensus mechanism, exemplifies this. Transactions are verified as renewable energy is produced, ensuring an authentic and transparent system supporting smart grids' evolution into a more secure and reliable energy future. This approach solidifies the role of projects like Rowan in advancing smart grid technology, demonstrating a practical and innovative application of blockchain in enhancing the energy sector.
