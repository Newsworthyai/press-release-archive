# Boom DeFi and Financial Times agree on strategic partnership bridging traditional and decentralised finance

Boom DeFi Ecosystem (“Boom”), the leading e-commerce without banking decentralised finance ecosystem, has signed a three-year strategic partnership with the Financial Times (FT) to tell stories about the businesses and billions of adults without access to the global financial system. Called The Unbanked Entrepreneur, it aims to capture entrepreneurial journeys and celebrate the pioneers fighting to level the playing field.

“Whilst digital transformation has made information and communication instant, the ability to transact and trade digitally is still not universal for over a billion adults. This partnership with the FT will tell the story of the missing billion entrepreneurs and the untapped market they represent.”

– Boom’s global head of partnerships, Sebastiano Moschini

“The Unbanked Entrepreneur is a purpose-driven, multimedia, cross-FT partnership that will spotlight those who have shown entrepreneurial spirit around the world and raise important issues around financial inclusion. This is a story that the FT is proud to tell alongside Boom.”

– FT global advertising director, Danny Aldred

The FT plans to expand its customer base by enabling unbanked adults worldwide to subscribe to the FT using BoomPay, the online payment gateway that enables businesses to collect payments from unbanked customers at checkout.

About Boom DeFi ecosystem At Boom, we are building a revolutionary new world of e-commerce without banking for the billions of consumers and businesses with no access to the global financial system by connecting their trillions of dollars in cash to the global digital economy, enabling them to securely store, move, exchange, send, receive and spend their cash online on goods and services worldwide, while maintaining full control of it.
