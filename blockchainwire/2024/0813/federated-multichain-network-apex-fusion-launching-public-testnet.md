This is more than just a milestone achievement for us, it's a move towards a more decentralized future.”," said Ivan Bjelajac, CEO of Apex Fusion Foundation. "Our strategic plan is to focus on builders, remove barriers in the current blockchain ecosystem and help future builders by providing the best from both EVM and UTXO worlds in one solution.”

The release of the public testnet is a crucial step in Apex Fusion's journey and a small win for the team and core contributors, including industry-recognized partners like Tenderly, Eternl, Charlie3, TxPipe, and others.
