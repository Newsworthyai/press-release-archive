# Ballet Launches the Bitcoin One Milli Block: A Unique Physical Bitcoin Collectible

Ballet, manufacturer of cryptocurrency cold storage wallets and physical bitcoins, announces the release of the One Milli Block, a physical bitcoin collectible. Each One Milli Block is pre-loaded with 3.125 mBTC (0.003125 BTC), which is a thousandth of the bitcoin block reward from block number 863,226, mined in September 2024.

Ballet’s One Milli Block brings newly mined bitcoin to the real world in a gleaming copper block, combining the security of Ballet’s cold storage with the ease of holding a physical bitcoin. Ballet took the bitcoins mined from block number 863,226 and evenly divided them into a thousand pieces for loading into each One Milli Block. These are truly virgin, uncirculated bitcoins.

“One Milli Block is a tangible symbol of Bitcoin’s mining legacy,” said Bobby Lee, the founder and CEO of Ballet. “We want to offer a memorable product for Bitcoin enthusiasts, collectors, and long-term investors. This One Milli Block commemorates the fifth epoch in Bitcoin mining rewards, which started at 50 BTC per block back in 2009, with the block reward now down to only 3.125 BTC per block.” These 1,000 blocks are only available for sale until December 25, and they make for great gifts this holiday season.

This exclusive collectible measures 2 by 2 inches and is packaged in an elegant black vegan leather gift box, making it an ideal addition to any cryptocurrency collection. With Bitcoin’s limited supply and established historical significance, this collectible serves as both an investment store of value and also a stark reminder of Bitcoin’s block reward halving every four years.

Getting a One Milli Block is the perfect way for crypto novices and seasoned professionals alike to HODL bitcoin and learn the importance of self custody—Not Your Keys, Not Your Bitcoin. This makes for an excellent and memorable gift for the holidays, especially during this Bitcoin bull market. The One Milli Block can be purchased at [bitcoin.ballet.com].
