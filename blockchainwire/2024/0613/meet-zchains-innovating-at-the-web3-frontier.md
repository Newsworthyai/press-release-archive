ZCD Token: Bridging worlds, fueling innovations

At the core of the vibrant ZChains ecosystem lies its native token, ZCD. With a total supply of 15 billion ZCD, this token fuels transactions, powers interactions, and serves as a medium of exchange and payment method for gas fees within the ecosystem.

A significant portion of the ZCD supply, 10 billion tokens, is earmarked for CEX allocation, ensuring widespread accessibility and liquidity across established exchanges. The remaining tokens are strategically allocated to marketing, foundation initiatives, and team holdings, laying the foundation for the ecosystem's sustainable growth.

With its unique tokenomics, the ZCD ecosystem aims to bridge the gap between in-game and real-world economies, offering users a truly unique and immersive experience.

But ZCD is not just a utility; it's a golden opportunity. With its own intrinsic value, ZCD is primed to make waves as it holds the potential to grow and perform well in the broader market.

Excitingly, ZCD will hit the market soon, and you'll have the chance to grab it from a range of established exchanges that will be announced shortly. Keep an eye on our community platform for updates to ensure you don't miss out!
