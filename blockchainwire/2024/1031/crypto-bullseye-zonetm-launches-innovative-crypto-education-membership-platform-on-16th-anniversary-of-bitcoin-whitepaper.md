Crypto Bullseye Zone™ Launches Innovative Crypto Education Membership Platform on 16th Anniversary of Bitcoin Whitepaper

Empowering people to learn Mistake-Free Crypto™ and embrace the next wave of mass adoption

October 31, 2024 – In commemoration of the 16th anniversary of Satoshi Nakamoto's groundbreaking Bitcoin Whitepaper, Crypto Bullseye Zone™ proudly announces the launch of its unique crypto education membership and crypto coaching platform. Designed to help people navigate the crypto space confidently and securely, the platform is set to support the next wave of crypto mass adoption.

Experience-Driven Expertise

"After witnessing countless people lose assets and fall victim to scams, I've distilled my extensive knowledge into a comprehensive system," explains founder Kirk David Phillips, CPA, CMA, CFE, CBP. With over 20,000 hours of experience and multiple professional certifications, Phillips offers a trusted educational platform at cryptobullseye.zone, addressing the common concerns of "Where do I start?" and "Who can I trust?" in the crypto space.

Solving the Crypto Education Trilemma

The crypto education trilemma highlights the challenges many face:

* Overwhelming information: There's too much to learn and not enough time.
* Missed opportunities: You'll miss too many opportunities.
* Costly mistakes: You'll make too many mistakes you can't afford.

Crypto Bullseye Zone™ addresses this trilemma through a system emphasizing risk management and security. Phillips notes, "In crypto, you are your biggest risk. Recognizing this empowers you to succeed confidently."

Cultivating the Crypto Mindset™

Success in crypto requires the right mindset. Crypto Bullseye Zone™ offers the Crypto Mindset™ to help you minimize self-inflicted risks and maximize your crypto success.

Inspired by Benjamin Graham's quote, "The essence of investment management is the management of risk, not the management of returns," our platform incorporates three principles into the Crypto Mindset™:

1. Get educated
2. Follow a process
3. Be prepared

Who Is This For?

Crypto Bullseye Zone™ caters to individuals seeking financial autonomy in this new asset class. Unlike traditional finance, crypto success requires personal involvement and education. It's ideal for those ready to take charge of their financial future through active learning and participation.

Crypto Bullseye Zone™ is ideal for:

* Newbies eager to learn about crypto.
* People serious about managing their own investments.
* Business owners and startups looking to benefit from crypto.
* Professionals seeking to upskill their crypto intelligence.
* Experienced crypto investors who want to elevate their crypto game.

What Crypto Bullseye Zone™ Is Not

* A source of investment advice
* A service that recommends specific investments
* A financial advisory service

"Information about crypto is more valuable than crypto itself," says founder Kirk David Phillips, CPA, CMA, CFE, CBPBridging the Trust Gap

A Pew Research study found that "roughly six-in-ten Americans (63%) have little to no confidence that current ways to invest in, trade, or use cryptocurrencies are reliable and safe." This widespread skepticism can be easily solved with the right comprehensive education platform.

Poised for the Next Wave of Global Adoption

There's a massive wave of worldwide crypto adoption on the horizon, and Crypto Bullseye Zone™ is leading the charge. According to The State of Global Cryptocurrency Ownership in 2024 by Triple-A:

* 6.8% of the world's population (562 million people) own crypto in 2024.
* Crypto ownership has surged with a 99% compound annual growth rate since 2018.

Hundreds of millions more will join the crypto space in the coming years, all needing a trusted education system like Crypto Bullseye Zone™.

Don't Miss the Next Golden Opportunity

Ark Invest research consistently forecasts Bitcoin reaching $1.5 million by 2030 in their annual Big Ideas Report. Most people are poised to miss this golden opportunity due to lack of knowledge.
