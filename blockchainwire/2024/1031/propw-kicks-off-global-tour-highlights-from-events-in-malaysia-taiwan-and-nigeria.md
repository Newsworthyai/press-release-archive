First Month of Events Launches Global Tour

Following their participation at [TOKEN2049 Singapore](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/09/24/2952092/0/en/CoinW-Makes-a-Lasting-Impression-at-TOKEN2049-with-Major-Collaborations-and-a-Legendary-After-Party.html) in September with [CoinW](https://www.coinw.com/), PropW began their global tour on October 10 with an AMA session co-hosted by Taiwan’s prominent crypto community, Crypto Hsu. The AMA featured PropW's Marketing Director, who introduced the platform as the first proprietary trading product tailored to crypto traders. He explained, "PropW was created to empower cryptocurrency traders by offering access to larger crypto markets. Many traders face high risks or lack of capital, and PropW solves these problems by providing both novice and seasoned users with opportunities to trade larger volumes, enhance their trading skills, and share profits without using their own funds. We offer up to 200,000 USDT in trading capital, and traders can earn up to 80% of the profits. Exceptional traders may even receive 90% of the profits over time."![](https://blockchainwire.s3.amazonaws.com/e4a220b7-1026-49d7-cb61-5e253b4e1d25/editor_image/9830a54f-0cde-4677-8937-56d222e57053.png)

After the successful AMA in Taiwan, the PropW team continued their tour with community events in Malaysia and Nigeria. The Malaysia event, held in Kuala Lumpur, attracted over 500 participants. Co-organized with the David Justin Blockchain Academy, the event featured a Prop Trading Hackathon. PropW’s Regional Business Director, William, introduced proprietary trading and provided a detailed overview of PropW’s platform, awarding top-performing traders at the event.
