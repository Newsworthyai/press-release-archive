Apotheka Systems Inc., a provider of blockchain and AI to facilitate digital transformation through EHR integrations, today announced an agreement with athenahealth, Inc. through the company’s Marketplace program. As part of the athenahealth® Marketplace, this newly integrated Apotheka Digital DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) Passport is now available to athenahealth’s growing network of healthcare providers to add self-sovereign patient IDs, providing patients with more control over their own care management and which piece of information to share within athenahealth’s care network.

3. Smart Contracts: Smart contracts that can automate various processes in hospitals, such as creating unique patient IDs that allow patients validation across multiple systems, consent management, insurance eligibility checks, claims processing and payments, based on predefined rules and conditions. This can streamline operations and reduce administrative costs from 30%-60%.
4. Fraud Detection: By analyzing data stored on the permissioned based blockchain, health systems can use advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms (AI) to detect patterns indicative of fraudulent activities considering yearly healthcare fraud claims amount to $380 billion plus yearly.
5. Interoperability: Blockchain technology can facilitate interoperability between siloed or different systems and stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem, allowing for seamless sharing of information while maintaining data privacy and security.
