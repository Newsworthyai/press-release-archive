GaiaNet is a decentralized network that provides secure, censorship-resistant, and monetizable AI agents that incorporate each individual’s proprietary knowledge and skills while preserving privacy. Instead of setting up centralized servers, GaiaNet is building a distributed network of edge-computing nodes controlled by individuals and businesses, to host fine-tuned AI models, based on the node operator’s proprietary domain knowledge and expertise. Each GiaiaNet node is a digital twin of a real-world expert or personality, such as a university teaching assistant, a high school teacher, a crypto trader, or a customer service agent, performing skilled knowledge tasks on behalf of its creator or operator. GaiaNet boldly challenges the centralized industry giants that have dominated the AI lifecycle, from data collection to model training and fine-tuning.

GaiaNet recognizes the advancement of edge AI research at Berkeley, particularly at the FHL Vive Center where it drives the adoption of small language models for offering interactive and educational AI teaching assistant services to the broad student community. GaiaNet envisions that its decentralized infrastructure will help to onboard more educational content and more educators in a decentralized fashion, and spread the use of AI teaching and learning applications outside the elite higher-education institutions to professional development and professional services markets.

“I am honored to collaborate with Berkeley in our shared mission to revolutionize learning through decentralized AI. GaiaNet is not just a network; it's a paradigm shift towards a more secure, censorship-resistant future while preserving privacy and autonomy”, stated Shashank Sripada， Co-founder of GaiaNet. “GaiaNet is also committed to simplicity, ensuring that individuals and businesses can easily set up their own nodes and fine-tune their AI models with their proprietary knowledge. Through GaiaNet's intuitive interface and streamlined processes, accessing cutting-edge AI technology has never been easier”.

As an esteemed academic institution, UC Berkeley Vive Center is primed to leverage its expertise to openly support the advancement of decentralized AI, especially with its partner ByteTrade to explore the technologies behind GaiaNet. This collaboration exemplifies the University's dedication to staying at the forefront of the most significant challenges and innovations in Artificial Intelligence.
