Having kicked off in Dubai back in March, continuing on to Hong Kong in April, this was CoinW’s third installment of the global series, which facilitates meaningful dialogue within the Web3 ecosystem by connecting government entities, regulators, industry leaders and other renowned experts.

With their impressive branded booth catching the attention of crowds in the main registration center, the cutting-edge digital asset trading platform welcomed an array of panelists to discuss various exciting topics relevant to the US Web3 landscape.

The reception was one of high appreciation and admiration for the level of key insights delivered. A strong rhetoric of advocating for compliance and collaboration around the latest regulatory policies was shared amongst other solutions to turn challenges into opportunities across the US landscape. The panel also provided a chance to discuss the latest developments around Ethereum ETFs and their influence on the ensuing bull market.
