Bridging Meme Culture and Real-World AssetsBAN ($BAN) draws its inspiration from the viral artwork "Comedian" famously featuring a banana taped to a wall. This playful concept, combined with a strong endorsement from the Vice President of Sotheby’s, positions BAN as a standout among meme coins. Notably, it is the first meme coin to integrate an RWA (Real-World Asset) concept, reflecting its ties to contemporary art and tangible value.After BAN's launch, Sotheby’s official Twitter account amplified the token’s presence by changing its profile picture to BAN’s meme logo.
