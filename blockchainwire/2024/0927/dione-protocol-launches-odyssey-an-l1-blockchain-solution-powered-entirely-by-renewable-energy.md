# Dione Protocol Launches Odyssey - an L1 blockchain solution powered entirely by renewable energy

Dione Protocol, a trailblazer in sustainable blockchain technology, proudly announces the launch of Odyssey, a groundbreaking Layer 1 (L1) blockchain solution designed with a commitment to renewable energy. Since its inception in 2022, Dione Protocol has been dedicated to merging blockchain technology with clean energy solutions to address critical challenges within the global energy sector. With the unveiling of Odyssey, Dione Protocol takes a significant leap towards promoting sustainability within the blockchain ecosystem.

Cryptocurrency mining's environmental impact is a concern due to high energy consumption and carbon emissions. Odyssey promotes sustainable blockchain solutions using renewable energy to minimize ecological footprints.

What is Odyssey Blockchain

Odyssey is a Layer 1 blockchain solution engineered to offer unparalleled performance while adhering to the highest standards of environmental sustainability. By harnessing renewable energy, Odyssey not only ensures energy-efficient operations but also sets a precedent for responsible blockchain development. The blockchain is designed to support a wide range of applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).

How is the Odyssey Blockchain powered by renewable energy?

Odyssey distinguishes itself through its dedication to renewable energy. This approach drastically reduces energy consumption while maintaining robust security and performance. Furthermore, Odyssey’s infrastructure is powered exclusively by renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, ensuring that all operations have a minimal environmental impact.

A key component of Dione’s blockchain is ORION—its DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) hardware. ORION is an advanced decentralized validation system that allows node operators to validate on-chain usage of renewable energy. It combines a metering device and a gateway with a highly energy-efficient processing unit, an AI protocol, and a blockchain validation protocol. This decentralized validation approach enhances transparency and security within the Odyssey ecosystem.

The blockchain utilizes an innovative artificial intelligence (AI) system with 95% accuracy in predicting whether energy consumption comes from renewable sources or is powered by the grid. This AI analyzes over 10,000 data points to identify and match weather conditions and energy sources in real-time. The prediction accuracy has a margin of error of only ±3%, ensuring reliable and precise data validation. This enables Odyssey to efficiently optimize energy consumption.

In addition, Dione plans to integrate other renewable energy sources into Odyssey's infrastructure in the future to further diversify the energy supply. The exclusive use of renewable energy and data-driven optimization through AI underscores Dione’s uncompromising commitment to eco-friendliness, with minimal environmental impact.

Key Features of Odyssey Blockchain

1. Higher Throughput: Odyssey is designed to handle over 4,500 transactions per second (TPS) on its Layer-1 chain, with the ability to scale further through additional optimizations and scaling solutions.
2. Enhanced Scalability: The network is built to efficiently scale to hundreds or even thousands of nodes without compromising performance, security, or decentralization.
3. Better Security and Data Privacy: Odyssey employs a multi-chain hybrid architecture that allows for the setup of permissioned subnets. This ensures that private data is accessible only to authorized parties, while data integrity is maintained through public hashes.
4. Enhanced Transaction Security: Transactions on Odyssey reach finality in about one second, achieving near-instant finality. The network validates all transactions as part of its consensus mechanism, increasing security and eliminating the need for the longest-chain rule.
5. EVM Compatibility: Odyssey Chain seamlessly integrates with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to deploy decentralized applications (dApps) quickly and cost-effectively using familiar tools and languages.
6. Robust APIs: The Odyssey API offers a comprehensive suite of functionalities, including transaction lists, statistical data, token holder counts, and wallet transfer histories, catering to a wide range of development needs.
7. Energy Efficiency: The proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, combined with a commitment to renewable energy sources, ensures that Odyssey operates with minimal energy consumption, reinforcing its dedication to environmental sustainability.
