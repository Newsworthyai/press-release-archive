Bitcoin (BTC) Stabilizes at $66,000 Following Halving Event

After a period marked by significant fluctuations, Bitcoin's price has found stability early this week, maintaining a position around $66,000 following its anticipated halving event. The adjustment, which occurred over the weekend, resulted in the reward for Bitcoin mining being cut from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoin, an essential part of the cryptocurrency's design to control inflation and reduce the rate at which new Bitcoins are introduced into circulation.

This halving, which takes place approximately every four years, is one of many steps in the long process towards the cap of 21 million Bitcoins. As of the latest event, there are projected to be 29 more such halvings before the final Bitcoin mining rewards are reduced to mere satoshis—the smallest unit of Bitcoin.

Leading up to the halving, Bitcoin experienced weeks of price volatility. However, as of Monday morning, the cryptocurrency appears to be resting on a solid support level. Blockchain analytics firm IntotheBlock reports that Bitcoin is now trading just above a significant demand zone. "With 1.66 million addresses having purchased Bitcoin at an average price of $64,800, this level may serve as strong support in the face of potential market downturns," stated IntotheBlock on social platform X.

In the immediate aftermath of the halving, Bitcoin transaction fees soared, reaching a record high of $127 momentarily during the weekend, as per data from Bitinfo Charts.

In related developments, other major cryptocurrencies such as Ether and Solana have also experienced modest gains, each up nearly 1% and trading at $3,100 and $152, respectively, as of Monday morning. The overall crypto market cap has seen a slight increase of 1.13%, climbing to a total of $2.41 trillion according to CoinMarketCap.

The crypto community continues to monitor these developments closely, considering the potential long-term impacts of Bitcoin's halving on the broader cryptocurrency market.

Ethereum (ETH) Experiences Slight Increase Following Bitcoin Halving

ETH has successfully regained its footing above the $3,000 mark as of Friday and continued to stabilize over the weekend. Currently, the price of Ethereum hovers just over $3,200, marking a 1.3% increase in the last 24 hours and nearly matching its price level from the same time last week, with only about a 1% difference.

In other positive developments, there is promising news for both Ethereum and Bitcoin as Hong Kong has conditionally approved spot ETFs for these cryptocurrencies. Local firms are optimistic about receiving final approvals to start issuing shares within the month. The initiation of trading is expected to alleviate some of the uncertainties surrounding cryptocurrencies in the region, potentially injecting $25 billion in new liquidity into the market
