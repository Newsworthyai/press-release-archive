About JOY

JOY  is the native digital asset for the Joystream Network with a supply of 1 billion coins. JOY plays a pivotal role within the Joystream decentralized video platform, facilitating governance mechanisms and powering interactions among creators, users, and validators. As an integral component of the Joystream ecosystem, JOY enables seamless transactions, incentivizes content creation and curation, and fosters community engagement. JOY embodies the spirit of decentralized innovation and empowerment, driving the evolution of online video sharing towards a more transparent, inclusive, and rewarding experience for all participants.

In addition to its utility within the Joystream network, JOY serves as a symbol of empowerment for content creators and users alike. By leveraging blockchain technology, JOY enables creators to retain ownership and control over their content, ensuring fair compensation and recognition for their contributions.

Through the issuance of creator tokens and the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), JOY enables creators to unlock additional revenue streams and establish direct relationships with their audience. Whether through tokenized ownership of exclusive content or participation in decentralized governance mechanisms, JOY holders are incentivized to actively contribute to the growth and sustainability of the Joystream ecosystem. As we continue to innovate and expand the capabilities of JOY, we envision a future where decentralized digital assets redefine the way value is exchanged, shared, and distributed within the online content landscape.
