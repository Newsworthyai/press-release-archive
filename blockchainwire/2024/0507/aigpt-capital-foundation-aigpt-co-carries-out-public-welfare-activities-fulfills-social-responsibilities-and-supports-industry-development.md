To fulfill its social responsibility, AIGPT has also carried out the following public welfare activities:

1. AIGPT funds research projects in the blockchain and AI fields at universities, supporting technological innovation and development to contribute to the industry's advancement.

2. AIGPT supports environmental initiatives and actively participates in activities to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, contributing to environmental protection.

AIGPT has announced that it will donate a portion of its income to charitable organizations to support various social welfare causes, help improve social welfare, and promote social fairness.

The core of AIGPT's trading system lies in its ability to analyze and process data. Through technologies like machine learning and deep learning, AIGPT's trading system can continuously learn and optimize trading strategies, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of trades. This system can automatically execute trades or operate based on predefined rules, reducing the impact of human factors on trading decisions and improving the stability and consistency of trades.

Information acquisition and processing have always been important topics in the financial market. AIGPT's AI intelligent trading system can automatically acquire and analyze a large amount of market data, better grasping market changes. This system can monitor market dynamics in real-time, identify potential trading opportunities, and react promptly. Compared to traditional manual trading, AI intelligent trading systems have faster decision-making speeds and a wider range of information acquisition, enabling better understanding of market changes.

Due to its admiration for AI, the company actively participates in promoting the informatization of impoverished areas. AIGPT provides electronic device support for financial inclusion projects in impoverished areas, such as tablets and smartphones, and provides technical support to enable local residents to access online finance and other network resources. This helps those who cannot access traditional financial services, promoting financial inclusion and sustainable development.

This not only helps impoverished residents integrate into the information society but also provides them with opportunities to learn about AI, blockchain, and communication. At the same time, AIGPT also conducts a series of digital literacy training activities to help impoverished residents master basic electronic device skills, improving their level of information literacy. These initiatives aim to promote AI and financial inclusion, allowing more people to benefit from the convenience and opportunities brought by AI and blockchain, contributing to the construction of an informatized society.

AIGPT hopes that through these public welfare activities, it can fulfill its social responsibility, contribute to the development of the industry, and benefit more people.
