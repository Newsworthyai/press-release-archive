DFC Future PlansDFC launched a global community building program in September to expand its brand awareness and market influence. The program aims to establish local DFC communities in multiple cities around the world to create hubs for DFC users and supporters. This initiative will not only significantly increase DFC's global brand awareness, but will also encourage more user participation and cultivate strong user retention and brand loyalty.

The global community building program is a highly creative and strategic initiative for DFC.
