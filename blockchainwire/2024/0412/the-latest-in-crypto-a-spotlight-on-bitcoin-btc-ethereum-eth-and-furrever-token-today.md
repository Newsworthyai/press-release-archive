Bitcoin's Market Value: A Comparative Analysis

On April 10, 2024, the value of a single bitcoin reached an impressive milestone, exceeding $70,000, with a specific value of $70,665. The total circulation of bitcoin at this time was over 19.68 million, culminating in a market capitalization exceeding $1.39 trillion. This marks a significant increase from the previous year, where the market cap was around $472 billion with approximately 19.35 million bitcoins in circulation.

To understand the proportion of global wealth represented by bitcoin, it's crucial to consider the overall monetary wealth. According to calculations by Credit Suisse, global wealth was estimated at $454.4 trillion by the end of 2022. Assuming a steady growth rate, the total global wealth by 2024 would be around $469.8 trillion, placing bitcoin at 0.3% of this figure.

Gold has traditionally been seen as the ultimate safe-haven asset. With an estimated 244,000 tons of gold discovered to date and a price per ounce of $2,334.90 as of April 10, 2024, the total value of all gold amounted to approximately $18.23 trillion. In this context, bitcoin's total value represented about 7.6% of the total value of all gold.

While bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency, it is far from the only one. Including other major cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, Monero, and Ethereum, the total market cap for cryptocurrencies was around $2.6 trillion as of April 10, 2024. This constituted roughly 0.56% of the total global money supply.

Cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, are known for their volatility, liquidity issues, and susceptibility to price manipulation. Potential investors are advised to thoroughly understand the risks associated with these digital assets.

Bitcoin, as a pioneering cryptocurrency, occupies a unique position in the global financial ecosystem. Its comparison to traditional assets like gold highlights its growing relevance and potential as a store of value, despite constituting a small fraction of the world's total monetary wealth. As the digital currency landscape evolves, bitcoin continues to be a significant player, reflecting broader trends in the move towards virtual assets.

Ethereum's Price Recovery: A Path to $3,600Ethereum has shown resilience by holding above the crucial $3,400 support zone, indicating a possible recovery from recent losses. However, to sustain an upward trajectory in the near term, it must breach the $3,600 mark.

The digital currency witnessed a downturn, dipping below the $3,500 threshold and momentarily breaching the $3,450 support level. Ethereum found its lowest point at $3,408 before initiating a recovery, paralleling Bitcoin's upward movement. This recovery saw Ethereum surpass the $3,500 resistance, reaching the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from its previous high of $3,726 to its low of $3,408. Additionally, Ethereum managed to break through a downward trend line on the ETH/USD hourly chart, signaling a potential reversal of the bearish trend.

Ethereum currently hovers around the $3,500 mark, closely aligned with the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, suggesting a balanced market sentiment. Immediate resistance is identified near $3,600, correlating with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level from the recent high to low swing.

Should Ethereum overcome the $3,650 resistance, it might target the $3,725 level, setting the stage for a possible move towards $3,780. A decisive break above $3,800 could catalyze a bullish momentum, possibly propelling the price to the $3,880 zone and, in an optimistic scenario, to the $4,000 mark.

Conversely, failure to surpass the $3,600 resistance could trigger a new round of selling. Immediate support is found near $3,520, with significant support at the $3,500 and $3,400 levels. A breach below $3,400 might lead to a decline towards $3,320, and further losses could potentially push the price down to $3,240.
