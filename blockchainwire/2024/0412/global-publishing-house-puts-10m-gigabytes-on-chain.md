# Global publishing house puts 10M gigabytes on chain

Serenity Shield, a multi-chain company delivering secure data storage and digital inheritance solutions, and Web2 publishing giant Contentra Technologies have announced a three-year agreement that is set to cement the crucial role of decentralized solutions in the future of data storage.

The deal signifies a major step forward in the recognition and application of blockchain technology’s real-world utility, with Contentra set to store 10 petabytes (10 million gigabytes) of digital data on Serenity Shield’s decentralized data storage solution. An initial implementation of 1 petabyte (1 million GB) aims to be achieved within four months, paving the way for Contentra to offer private and secured decentralized data storage solutions to its existing clients during operational expansion.

Established in 2006 and based in New Delhi, Contentra Technologies specializes in digital content development for educational publishers, digital news media, aggregators, governments, and corporations worldwide. With a client roster, including BBC Studios, Carnegie Learning, Pearson and National Geographic, the firm has become one of the most prominent names in Web2 publishing services.

Shiva Saikia, Co-Founder and Director of Contentra Technologies, said:

"Our partnership with Serenity Shield represents a strategic move towards offering cutting-edge blockchain-based data storage solutions to our global clientele. This agreement underscores our commitment to innovation and delivering high-quality services. We at Contentra Technologies have been offering Data conversion and digitisation services to our global clients for over 10 years with our own in-house automated software.

This collaboration also highlights our proactive approach to moving with future trends and embracing technological advancements that enhance the overall client experience."

Venket Naga, CEO of Serenity Shield, and Shiva Saikia, Co Founder and Director of Contentra Technologies, penned the monumental agreement earlier this week.

In taking this major step into the Web2 World, Serenity Shield hopes to accelerate the mass adoption of blockchain technology by demonstrating its adept capabilities to transform global institutional processes. Web3’s potential to remodel mass data storage is still in its infancy, yet this agreement between two hugely influential players on either side of the fence is set to change that
