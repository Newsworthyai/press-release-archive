# Dypius Enables Secure Cross-Chain NFT Transfers for CAWS and World of Dypians with Chainlink CCIP

Dypius has integrated Chainlink CCIP — the highest standard for safe cross-chain interoperability in the Web3 industry - to enable seamless NFT transfers across the Ethereum, BNB Chain, Avalanche, and Base mainnets. Owners of Cats and Watches Society (CAWS) and World of Dypians (WOD) land NFTs can now securely move their assets across these blockchains, enjoying an enhanced user experience and driving the platform’s growth.

The CCIP interoperability solution is only one of the several Chainlink services that Dypius has integrated in recent years. This movement aligns with the platform’s goals to provide highly secure Web3 products and revolutionize the NFT landscape. Its continuous growth and recent updates show that Dypius is among the most innovative projects in the blockchain sphere.

How Chainlink CCIP Helps Dypius GrowChainlink is a world-class decentralized computing platform servicing financial institutions, startups, and developers while ensuring the utmost security for cross-chain interoperability, off-chain computation, and real-world data. The company has enabled financial institutions with $9 trillion in transactions to date - a proven track record of reliability and security that convinced Dypius to choose it as its primary interoperability solution.

CCIP is a continuously improving mechanism with a scalable architecture that allows developers to easily build custom chain-specific integrations and interact with any blockchain network via a user-friendly interface.

One of CCIP’s standout features is the backup from the Risk Management Network — a separate, independent network continually monitoring and verifying cross-chain operations. Its role is to add an extra layer of protection against the vulnerabilities of the cross-chain infrastructure.

Future updates to CCIP will benefit Dypius and its users, who won't have to pay the switching costs if new cross-chain functionalities become necessary. This way, Dypius ensures its NFT owners enjoy ever-increasing security and efficiency without reducing quality or affordability.

Dypius has integrated several Chainlink services besides CCIP in recent years. In 2021, the platform integrated Chainlink Price Feeds into the Dypius ecosystem to help secure decentralized ETH and BNB price data. This movement supports access to real-time asset prices directly on-chain and thus ensures reliable and secure rewards data.

Incorporating Chainlink VRF & Automation helped Dypius deliver a unique and unpredictable gaming experience within World of Dypians while increasing data quality and performance.

Integrating CCIP will help Dypius users engage in seamless interactions and transfers across some of the most used blockchain networks. The platform should become more efficient and secure while growing and diversifying its user base.
