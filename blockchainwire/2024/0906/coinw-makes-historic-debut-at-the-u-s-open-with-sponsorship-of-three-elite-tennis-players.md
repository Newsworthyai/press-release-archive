“Tennis, with its demanding combination of skill, discipline, and excellence, mirrors the values that drive CoinW,” said Sonia Shaw, President of CoinW. “Sponsoring these remarkable athletes underscores our commitment to fostering excellence both in the sports arena and within the world of digital assets.”

The U.S. Open, one of the four prestigious Grand Slam tournaments, is recognized globally as a premier sporting event. This year’s tournament, which follows the excitement of the 2024 Paris Olympics, has drawn millions of sports enthusiasts. CoinW is seizing this unique opportunity to introduce digital assets to a broader, global audience, reinforcing its position as a leader in the crypto industry.

Since its founding, CoinW has been at the forefront of integrating cryptocurrency with global sports.

The sponsorship of these tennis champions is the latest step in CoinW’s mission to be the world’s most trusted crypto ally, providing innovative financial solutions and empowering users across the globe.
