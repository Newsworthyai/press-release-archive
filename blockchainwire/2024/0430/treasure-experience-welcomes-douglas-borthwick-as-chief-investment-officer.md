# Treasure Experience Welcomes Douglas Borthwick as Chief Investment Officer

I'm honored to have a front seat and look forward to the 2024 season”.

Mr. Borthwick added: “Michael Bomhoff (Treasure Experience CTO) and I have been working on a more quantitative way of looking at the business and will be unveiling that in the next few weeks.

I look forward to communicating the unique qualities to the community in the coming weeks."
