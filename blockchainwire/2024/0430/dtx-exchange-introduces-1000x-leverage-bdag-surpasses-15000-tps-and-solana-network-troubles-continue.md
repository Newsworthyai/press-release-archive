While bogged down with Solana problems, investors are rotating into new projects, and consistently cycle, new launches have always outperformed old coins massively. This cycle will be no exception, and $DTX and $BDAG are primed to explode. DTX Exchange (DTX) Introduces 1,000X Leverage DTX Exchange (DTX) has garnered massive attention, and this presale is flagging every indicator it wants to post a dramatic rally post-launch. Price predictions already forecast a 25X rally for early buyers, and this hybrid platform is a trading hub built by traders for traders. It brings a host of new tradable assets to DeFi, including traditional equities, forex, contracts-for-differences (CFDs), and hundreds of altcoins.

With more than 120,000 financial instruments and trading volume skyrocketing in the bull market, this presale has rapidly become one of the top cryptos to buy now. BlockDAG (BDAG) Surpasses 15,000 TPS

BlockDAG (BDAG) is a new layer one blending speed and security. Based on the original Bitcoin (BTC) network and the slightly newer Kaspa (KAS) network, BlockDAG (BDAG) takes the classic Proof of Work consensus mechanism but alters it so that anybody can help secure the network from a mobile device. All miners, users contributing to the network using their mobiles, earn BlockDAG (BDAG) tokens and the network has eclipsed speeds of 15,000 transactions per second. Another presale primed to explode, BlockDAG (BDAG) is another leading crypto to buy this cycle. Solana (SOL) Network Still Facing Problems

Solana's (SOL) problems persist, and this network cannot catch a break. What is causing Solana's problems? An influx of low-quality transactions on the network. The greatest strength of Solana (SOL) is its high speed and low transaction cost, but bots are spamming the network with requests. Whereas on other layer ones, gas fees make this behavior too expensive, the low gas fees have caused Solana problems.While the network performs sub-optimally, analysts forecast the native Solana (SOL) token to slow down and believe that investors would be better off allocating to exciting up-and-coming presales like $DTX and $BDAG. Is DTX Exchange the Future of On-Chain Trading?

Introducing a new range of assets and 1,000X leverage as the bull market commences is an incredible value proposition. DTX Exchange benefits from DeFiâ€™s growing strength and liquidity, and this trading hub has everything it needs to become a dominant player this cycle. Could it become a blue chip before the end of 2024?
