# BlockDAG Network’s Advisory Board Member Revealed on Forbes

In the fast-paced and often opaque world of cryptocurrency, transparency is a rare and valuable commodity. One of the most debated topics within the industry is the practice of doxxing, or revealing the identities of the teams behind crypto projects.

While some argue that transparency fosters trust and credibility, others believe that anonymity protects developers from potential threats and harassment. However, recent developments suggest that the tide may be turning, with more projects opting to step out from behind the metaphorical “curtain,”embracing transparency and presenting their full selves on the brightly illuminated stage of the cryptocurrency theatre.

To Reveal or Not to Reveal?

The decision to reveal the identities of the team behind a cryptocurrency project can have far-reaching implications. On one hand, knowing a project’s team members names and faces provides investors and users with a greater sense of security, recognising that there are real people accountable for the project's success. It also allows for more open communication and collaboration, which of course fosters a stronger sense of community around the project. However, it also exposes team members to potential risks, such as doxxing, hacking, and personal attacks.

The crypto mystery number one, the most enduring enigma in the digital world, for example, surrounds Satoshi Nakamoto and the creation of Bitcoin. Despite Bitcoin's immense success and widespread adoption, the true identity of its creator—or creators—remains shrouded in secrecy. Satoshi Nakamoto's anonymity adds to the allure and mystique of Bitcoin; In turn, this sparks endless speculation and curiosity among enthusiasts and observers alike. Whether Satoshi is an individual or a group, their vision and innovation have forever changed the landscape of finance, leaving an indelible mark on the world of cryptocurrency.
