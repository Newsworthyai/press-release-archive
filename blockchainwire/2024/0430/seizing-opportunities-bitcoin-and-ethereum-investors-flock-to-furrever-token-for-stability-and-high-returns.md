Bitcoin (BTC) Analysis: Dominance Rises Amidst Market CorrectionBitcoin (BTC) is currently priced at around $62,369.67, experiencing a 2% decrease in the last 24 hours. Despite a recent decline in price, Bitcoin's dominance has been on the rise, reaching 50.9% amidst a market correction that impacted several altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH). Analysis suggests that selling pressure on BTC has decreased, with indicators like exchange reserves and miner activity pointing towards a willingness to hold BTC. Technical indicators such as Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) and Money Flow Index (MFI) hint at a potential price increase in the near future, although the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains bearish. Looking ahead, BTC's price might test the $61k support level before potentially rallying to reclaim $66k and even reaching $71k in the coming months.

Ethereum (ETH) Faces Regulatory Hurdles: ETF Approval Stalled by SECEthereum (ETH) is currently priced at around $3,179, marking a 4.20% decline amid regulatory uncertainty surrounding the approval of Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Reports from Reuters suggest that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been delaying decisions on proposed ETH ETFs, leading to discouraging meetings and one-sided discussions with potential issuers. Recent court filings indicate the SEC's inclination to regulate Ethereum as a security despite jurisdictional uncertainties. As deadlines loom for ETF decisions from companies like VanEck and ARK Invest, industry experts express skepticism regarding the likelihood of approval, citing a lack of constructive dialogue from the SEC. Tron founder Justin Sun predicts an ETH ETF rejection, emphasizing the need for continued education for regulators on blockchain technology. With ETH experiencing a 10.2% decrease in value over the past 30 days and trading 35% below its all-time high, the regulatory landscape poses challenges for its price performance, especially in light of its significant correlation with Bitcoin (BTC).
