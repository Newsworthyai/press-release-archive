According to the official announcement, following the completion of the WBS token contract upgrade, Websea will utilize 10% of its transaction fee revenue each month for the buyback and burn of WBS tokens. The purpose of this initiative is to reduce the circulating supply of WBS tokens. The transparency of the burning event further enhances community trust and support for the Websea platform, providing it with greater market competitiveness.

Websea's product strategy is adapting to the needs of its user base, especially younger users. Planned new products and features, such as the deep integration of WBS with the GameFi concept and the upcoming gaming section, aim to enhance user interactivity and engagement. These strategies not only reflect Websea's efforts in product innovation but also demonstrate its sensitivity to market trends and user demands.

The introduction of the gaming section provides not only new use cases, such as in-game purchases and trading of gaming assets, but also helps increase the platform's trading frequency and user engagement. This not only enhances the practical utility of WBS but also strengthens its market recognition and attractiveness. It is foreseeable that in the GameFi field, Websea's innovative solutions and enhanced user experience will open up new growth opportunities for the platform.

The monthly burning event of WBS tokens not only showcases Websea's meticulous design of its token economy but also serves as a clear demonstration of its macro market strategy. By regularly reducing the circulating supply of WBS tokens, Websea has successfully enhanced the token's scarcity and market value, stabilized market expectations, and boosted investor confidence in its future value.

This strategy effectively addresses the high volatility of the crypto market, demonstrating Websea's high professionalism in risk management and market positioning, proving its potential and foresight as a leader in the blockchain industry to the market. With the further implementation of future strategies, Websea is expected to continue playing a significant role in the global crypto economy, driving the entire industry towards greater maturity and sustainability.
