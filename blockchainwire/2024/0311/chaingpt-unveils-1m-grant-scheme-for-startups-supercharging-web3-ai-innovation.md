# ChainGPT unveils $1M grant scheme for startups supercharging Web3-AI innovation

[ChainGPT](https://www.chaingpt.org/), the AI-powered Web3 infrastructure providing a diverse suite of tools and services, announces the launch of a grant program to help facilitate innovation at the crossroads of AI and blockchain. With a total of up to $1 million in grants available for startups across different development stages, ChainGPT will offer three tiers of funding: Scaling-focused growth grants, builder grants to kickstart early-stage innovation, and research grants for newly launched projects.![](https://api.blockchainwire.io/uploads/Proleoio/editor_image/21724a85-1a37-4732-8abb-ca588aa7938d.jpg)

Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin recently wrote about possible synergies between AI and blockchain, concluding that he looks forward to “seeing more attempts at constructive use cases of AI in all these areas, so we can see which of them are truly viable at scale.” While this sentiment is widely agreed upon among Web3 builders, AI’s centralized nature creates friction with blockchain and Web3’s core ethos. Overcoming this and other obstacles disrupting collaboration between the technologies requires honing in on R&D as well as promoting industry dialogue and education.

Establishing the grant program aligns with ChainGPT’s core mission to enhance the blockchain space with AI-powered solutions and support Web3 developers building AI technologies designed for blockchain. The program’s chief objective is to remove entry barriers for startups—providing them with the necessary resources to allow innovation to flourish by empowering them with AI technologies tailored to blockchain applications.

A core feature of the grant program is the access it opens to the ChainGPT ecosystem, including its wide array of AI-powered tools for blockchain. Among these are ChainGPT’s APIs and SDKs, which provide startups with a robust toolkit to build AI-powered applications, tools, and products. Whether a startup is looking for a plug-and-play solution via an API or a more tailored approach using the SDK, ChainGPT’s technical infrastructure enables participants to benefit from advancements in AI.

Startups can apply for the grants program through an online application. ChainGPT’s team will assess each startup’s eligibility, potential impact, and overall fit before an interview portion and final decision. Startups can apply for a maximum grant of $50 thousand, with ChainGPT providing $1 million in total grants to be distributed in USDT and credit for its suite of products.

With numerous applications already submitted, some early featured projects to have been awarded grants from ChainGPT’s include:

Kryptomon: A popular Web3 game from Pink Moon Studios that enables users, known as trainers, to collect, breed, and trade unique creatures within the Kryptomon universe.
