# Alpha Transform Holdings Releases New Research on Gryphon Digital Mining,  Announces Price Target of $3.37 per Share (NASDAQ: GRYP)

Alpha Transform Holdings (ATH), a leading digital asset investment and advisory organization, released new research, Gryphon Digital Mining (GRYP): Green-Energy Powered Bitcoin Mining, announces price target of $3.37 per share.

- Gryphon Digital Mining is a public Bitcoin miner that recently has been listed on the NASDAQ exchange and has established itself as a leader in sustainability and efficiency.

- Led by Rob Chang, the management team leverages its many years in the public Bitcoin miner space and utilizes an asset-light business model to compete in this highly competitive industry.

- Bitcoin mining involves specialized computers (ASICs) verifying transactions and solving complex mathematical problems to add blocks to the blockchain.

- Bitcoin miners are all preparing for the upcoming Bitcoin supply halving which occurs every ~4 years and cuts the rewards given to miners in each block by half.

- Gryphon Digital Mining is well-positioned to outperform less efficient public miners going into the Bitcoin halving this year and can now utilize the public capital markets for its M&A strategy and rely on its seasoned leadership team that has managed through multiple Bitcoin cycles in the past to execute sustainable growth.

The asset-light model that Gryphon Digital utilizes will enhance its flexibility and enable the company to respond to new developments in the digital asset ecosystem unlike other bigger miners in the space.
