Presale and NFT LaunchIn tandem with the whitelist event, Elpisgame announces the pre-sale of the Origin series' first NFT batch on the Polygon. This exclusive pre-sale includes 1,000 limited S-level characters, Arika and Helix. Owners of these characters gain 100% assured beta test access, along with game rights, benefits, and exclusive perks for future challenges.

Elpisgame: Defining a New Standard for GamingBeyond its whitelist event, Elpis Origin stands out with its innovative features, positioning itself as a catalyst in the Web 3.0 entertainment space. The game will launch with two playing modes: standard mode and challenge mode. However, a third, PvP mode, is currently set for future release.

Elpis Origin introduces a three-token economic model that encompasses NFTs, sub-tokens, and DAO tokens. The game’s creators say the three-token model, coupled with additional upgrading and synthesis elements, is built to augment the playability and replayability of the game.

In addition, Elpis Origin has partnered with music labels to present an extensive music library filled with pop music from various parts of the globe, positioning the game as a go-to virtual destination for music enthusiasts.

CreatorFi, Community Incentives, and Empowerment But that’s not all. In a strategic move toward fostering a symbiotic relationship between gaming and creativity, Elpisgame is bringing in a creator economy, dubbed CreatorFi, to help music creators gain exposure through in-game integration.

Moreover, Elpis Origin is cultivating an autonomous community, where DAO token holders become integral contributors to the game’s ecosystem. Beyond mere participation, community members will hold voting rights and dividend rewards, directly sharing in the profits generated from advertising, NFT sales, and transaction fees. This approach is not only meant to strengthen community engagement but also aims to empower individuals within the Elpisgame community.
