Founded by industry veterans with over 20 years of experience from behemoths like Shanda Games, Blizzard, Perfect World, and others, MetaCene is developed on Unreal Engine 5 with wide accessibility across PC, iOS, Android, and cloud platforms, ensuring seamless million-player online experiences.

Through two rounds of rigorous Alpha Test in 2023, MetaCene has not only demonstrated the game's AAA-aspiring quality but also highlighted its rapidly growing community base. From Alpha Test V.1 to V.2, the number of participating players had grown from 2,961 to 5,000+; daily average gaming time had increased from 2.5 hours per player to 4 hours. Notably, during Alpha Test V.2, over 20% of players made on-chain purchases, averaging $143 per paid-player.

MetaCene has launched two major NFT collections along its rapid game development. The MetaCene Apostle NFT (MAN) collection, limited to 500 pieces for the most honorable contributors to the ecosystem, achieved an impressive 400% value growth during Alpha Test V.2. The Cece Cube NFT collection, consisting of 2,997 pieces, has established itself as a driving force of MetaCene’s NFTFi system. MAN and Cece collections have accumulated a total volume of 1,314 ETH, reflecting the strong valuation and community confidence in MetaCene assets.

"This funding empowers us to accelerate our ambitious vision. We'll invest in expanding our development team and attracting top talent across tech, design, and community management. The funds will fuel user acquisition initiatives and deepen our engagement with the passionate MetaCene community. Ultimately, we're committed to delivering the most immersive and player-driven blockchain MMORPG experience possible, and this investment serves as a springboard for achieving that goal," said Alan Tan, the founder and CEO of MetaCene.

Collaborated with powerhouses like Mocaverse, YGG and Ancient8 and galvanized by committed investors, MetaCene looks forward to Alpha Test V.3 in March 2024, which will include both PC and mobile platforms. Through the upcoming Content Creator Incubation Program, MetaCene is preparing to launch the Realms NFT collection, an innovative server-centered asset that will allow holders to build their own MetaCene world.

As the release of Commercial Version 1.0 inches closer in 2024, MetaCene aims to bring its co-creation and co-governance vision into life through AI integration and blockchain assets. By actively incorporating community feedback and ideas into the game design, MetaCene aspires to drive the maturation of a meta-MMO platform and continues to offer an unparalleled experience for all players.
