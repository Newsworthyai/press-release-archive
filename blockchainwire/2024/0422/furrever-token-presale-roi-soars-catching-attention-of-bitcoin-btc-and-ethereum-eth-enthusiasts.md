Bitcoin (BTC) Halving Day and ETF Inflows Surge on 4/20 Caused a Slight ClimbBitcoin (BTC) is currently trading around $65,177.84, marking a 2.5% increase since the halving event that took place yesterday. The timing of this halving has sparked curiosity, as it coincided with the infamous "4/20" meme date, leading to a curious alignment observed by Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.

Despite a slowdown in inflows for Bitcoin ETFs since their peak in March, BlackRockâ€™s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) continues to attract consistent inflows, with 69 consecutive days of positive inflows. Other ETFs, including those operated by Fidelity Investments, also saw significant inflows on April 19, signaling a potential return of momentum.

While outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) were modest on the day, recent Form 13F filings have raised concerns about the penetration of Bitcoin ETFs into the mainstream investment landscape. However, Balchunas remains optimistic, likening the asset managers' approach to Bitcoin ETFs to "hot sauce," suggesting that while the number of holders may be relatively small, there is significant potential for growth and adoption.

Overall, the surge in ETF inflows on 4/20 raises questions about the future trajectory of Bitcoin's price and the broader adoption of cryptocurrency ETFs in traditional investment portfolios.

Ethereum (ETH) Surges 4% Post-BTC Halving: Whales Return as Investors Seek AlternativesEthereum (ETH) has surged by 4% to reach approximately $3,163.71 following Bitcoin's halving event and the ensuing market hype. This uptrend in Ethereum's price mirrors the overall positive sentiment across the cryptocurrency market, with total market capitalization rising by 3.5% in tandem. Notably, the gains in Ether versus the U.S. dollar are largely attributed to capital inflows from the Bitcoin market, driving the ETH/BTC pair up by roughly 2.5% to 0.048 BTC on April 21. This ETH/BTC ratio surge, along with the Ethereum Dominance Index (ETH.D) growth of over 1%, reflects a pattern observed after previous Bitcoin halving events. Historically, Ethereum has seen increased capital inflows from Bitcoin investors seeking new growth opportunities post-halving. Furthermore, Ethereum's latest gains coincide with a period of accumulation among its wealthiest investors, as highlighted by the increase in Ether supply held by addresses with significant balances. Technical indicators also suggest strong support for Ether's price, with key support levels aligning closely with Fibonacci retracement lines and moving averages, indicating an attractive entry point for traders.
