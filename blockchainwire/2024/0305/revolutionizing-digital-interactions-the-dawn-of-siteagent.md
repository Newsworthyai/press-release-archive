Beyond Traditional Search: AI as the Universal Gateway to the InternetTraditionally, the journey of online shopping or seeking professional services begins with a search engine.

This feature effectively allows people to talk to websites, asking questions or expressing needs in natural language, such as "I'm looking for white sneakers without laces" on an online store, or "What are the requirements for an auto loan?" on a bank's website. This voice functionality transcends the traditional text-based interfaces, making digital navigation more intuitive, accessible, and aligned with the natural human inclination for spoken communication. It represents a significant leap forward, offering a truly hands-free and seamless digital experience.
