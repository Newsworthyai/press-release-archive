- Empowered community involvement :With Mazu Finance, your voice matters. Participate in governance votes, contribute to discussions, and help shape the future of DeFi. Your involvement directly influences our direction and success.

- Diverse Defi Exposure:Beyond traditional yield farming, Mazu Finance offers innovative ways to grow your portfolio, including low-risk DeFi strategies and exposure to potential airdrops, maximizing your returns across the DeFi landscape.

What does the ecosystem of Mazu Finance include?

Mazu DAO: A significant portion of the self-financed funds will be placed in the Mazu DAO treasury. The DAO will be responsible for selecting low-risk opportunities to earn yield. Such opportunities may include, but are not limited to, borrow/lending pools, stablecoin LPs and liquid staking.

The $MAZU tax will continuously increase the capital of the DAO treasury, which can be allocated to different yield-bearing strategies. As more people trade $MAZU, this will further increase the DAO's revenues. As a result, the DAO will have a scalable and infinite source of yield and revenue, which will continue to grow indefinitely. For example, yield from liquid staking will continue as long as the Sui blockchain exists.

MAZU token: The $MAZU token is the central element of our ecosystem and is designed to simplify the complexities of DeFi and airdrop farming. To get exposure to yield opportunities, all our sailors need to do is hold $MAZU.

The $MAZU token is deflationary by design, with a 2% tax levied on each decentralised exchange transaction. The $MAZU buy tax is directed towards the treasury, supporting and expanding the operations of Mazu DAO. The $MAZU sell tax may be sent to a burn address, contributing to a reduction in the total supply of $MAZU.
