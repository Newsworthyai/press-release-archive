Empowering DeSci Through Blockchain

Bio Protocol aims to reshape biotechnology research funding, development, and intellectual property (IP) sharing through its innovative decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) model. By addressing disparities in traditional biomedical research funding, the project focuses on critical areas such as rare diseases, longevity, and emerging health challenges.

As a recognized leader in the DeSci space, Bio Protocol has garnered attention and support from major players, including Binance, with total funding exceeding $33 million. Developed by the same team behind VitaDAO, a project backed by Pfizer, Bio Protocol exemplifies the synergy of blockchain technology and scientific innovation.

BIO Tokenomics and Utility

The BIO token powers the Bio Protocol ecosystem, offering a wide range of use cases:

* · Governance: BIO holders participate in BioDAO governance votes, shaping the project's direction and resource allocation.
* · Incentives: Staking BIO tokens allows users to earn rewards and revenue shares from BioDAO projects.
* · Liquidity: BIO facilitates trading and liquidity on decentralized platforms, enhancing accessibility for the Bio Protocol ecosystem.
* · Funding Allocation: The tokens directly fund research projects or support participation in platform auctions.

With a total supply of 3.32 billion BIO, the tokenomics prioritize ecosystem growth, rewarding community members and early contributors while ensuring a robust structure for long-term development.
