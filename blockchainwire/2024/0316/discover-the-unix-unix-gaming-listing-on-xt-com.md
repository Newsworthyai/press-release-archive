About UNIX

UNIX is a ERC-20 token deployed on the Ethereum layer-1 blockchain with a max supply of 1 billion tokens. The UNIX Gaming team has chosen to release all Seed and Private Round UNIX tokens, enabling the free market to determine their value. This decision underscores our belief that over an approximate eighteen-month vesting period, the token price will stabilize naturally. The project’s rationale behind this approach is simple yet profound: it reflects our unwavering commitment to fostering a robust and fair trading environment, driven by the fundamental principles of demand and supply. By relinquishing control over token distribution, we aim to empower the community and align our interests with the broader goals of decentralization.

Central to this transition is the active involvement of our team's advisor, who has previously spearheaded the token raise. As the UNIX ecosystem braces for a bullish trajectory, the invaluable expertise of our advisor will guide us through the evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency market.

The UNIX Gaming team emphasizes that this strategic move does not compromise our core mission. Unlike other blockchain ventures that may have deviated from their original focus, UNIX Gaming remains steadfastly dedicated to our vision within the realm of Web3 gaming. We are committed to serving as a beacon of stability amidst the turbulence of the cryptocurrency space.

Albin Warin, CEO of XT.COM, commented on the listing of UNIX on the exchange, highlighting the significance of UNIX Gaming's project within the cryptocurrency landscape. He remarked, "UNIX Gaming's dedication to revolutionizing the gaming experience aligns seamlessly with our vision of fostering innovation within the cryptocurrency space. As UNIX finds its place on XT.com's platform, it not only gains access to a broader audience of cryptocurrency enthusiasts but also solidifies its position as a pioneering force in the evolving realm of decentralized gaming."
