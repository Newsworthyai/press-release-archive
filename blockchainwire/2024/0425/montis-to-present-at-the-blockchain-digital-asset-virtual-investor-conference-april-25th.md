About Montis Group

1. Montis is a 3-year-old startup at the Seed Round funding stage.
2. Based in London and in Luxembourg, we are a team of infrastructure practitioners and technology innovators who believe that all assets are moving on-chain, hence the regulated infrastructure needs to be ready for that moment.
3. Our management team come from the incumbents, so we have seen the issues and are addressing market demand for tokenised securities.
4. We exist because the markets are waiting (frustrated) and the incumbents are very slow.
5. Montis is ahead of the curve and with all the largest financial institutions agreeing tokenisation is the future, we are perfectly placed.
