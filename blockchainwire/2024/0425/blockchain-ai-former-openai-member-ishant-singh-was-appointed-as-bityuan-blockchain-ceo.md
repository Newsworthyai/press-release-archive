In 2021, Ishant Singh joined OpenAI as one of its early members.

He also created comprehensive product policies to guide the responsible use of OpenAI APIs and established protocols for high-risk applications. During his time at OpenAI, Ishant Singh not only accumulated valuable industry experience but also gained a profound understanding of the potential risks and challenges of AI.

In June 2023, Ishant Singh decided to transform his knowledge and experience in the field of AI into practical action and began to establish his own startup company.

Now, as the CEO of BitYuan Blockchain, Ishant Singh believes that his professional knowledge and experience will help promote the innovative integration of blockchain and AI, creating new application scenarios and business models. He stated that BitYuan Blockchain is an emerging open-source blockchain network, which is not widely known at present, but its simple, stable, decentralized core features and level 2 advantages make it a competitive force in the industry. BitYuan is one of the first blockchains to implement level2 solutions and has achieved the parallel chain architecture since May 2018. This architecture allows developers to create multiple parallel public chains on the main chain, share the main chain's consensus network, and achieve interconnection. BitYuan's asset cross-chain does not require a cross-chain bridge but is achieved through built-in cross-chain contracts, solving the problem of isolated asset island on Ethereum. At the same time, BitYuan is fully compatible with EVM, supporting the seamless transfer of Ethereum ecosystem applications.

Ishant Singh emphasized that with the rise of the web3 era, the combination of blockchain and AI is becoming an inevitable trend in the development of technology. He will use his profound experience in the field of AI to work with the team to deeply explore the potential of the integration of BitYuan Blockchain and AI technology.
