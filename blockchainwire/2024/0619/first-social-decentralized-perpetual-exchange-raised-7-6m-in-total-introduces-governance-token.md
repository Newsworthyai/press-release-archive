The protocol is designed to make trading social with gamified trading battles of perpetual futures, leveraging its appchain to deliver unparalleled scalability and high-speed APIs.

They launched their native token, $ZKX, on KuCoin, Gate.io, and Bitget. The launch of the $ZKX token empowers ZKX users and community members to shape the direction of the protocol alongside the team.

Eduard Jubany Tur, Founder at ZKX, said, “Two years ago, we launched ZKX with the goal of making DeFi accessible and social. Today, we celebrate a major milestone with the launch of the $ZKX token. This token isn't just a digital asset; it’s a way to reward the incredible contributions from our community members, users, and partners. It will play a key role in governance, staking, and growth of the ZKX ecosystem. We deeply appreciate the support of our investors who believe in our vision. This milestone marks the beginning of a transformative year for ZKX and our users.”
