Alman Company established CLEBUS in 2006 and incorporated blockchain technology to boost Web3 transformation of people’s daily lives.

> Event attendees or members of loyalty or rewards programs to seamlessly generate a Smart Pass or proof of ownership via attestation or email;

> Onboarding of web2 users at scale without the need for a web3 wallet or complex signature verification meaning easy onboarding into web3 experiences and the ability for any Smart Pass holder to effortlessly unlock rewards or experiences.
