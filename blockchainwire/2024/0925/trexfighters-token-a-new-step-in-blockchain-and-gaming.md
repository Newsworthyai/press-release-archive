Operating on the TON network, Trex is set to pave a new path for the use of digital currencies and blockchain-based gaming, with a focus on Trex Exchange and the gaming industry.

Why Trexfighters Could Break All Records and Become a Favorite in the Crypto Community?

Launching the Trex decentralized wallet for secure asset management.

Listing on major global exchanges once it reaches 25 million users.

Conclusion:

Thanks to its smart focus on exchanges and gaming, along with its innovative approach to rewarding users, Trex is becoming one of the leading projects in the blockchain space. Even Binance has recognized the potential of this project and is closely monitoring the development of TrexFighters.

The TrexFighters development team will hold only 1% of the project's tokens, which will be locked for the team for a year after launch.
