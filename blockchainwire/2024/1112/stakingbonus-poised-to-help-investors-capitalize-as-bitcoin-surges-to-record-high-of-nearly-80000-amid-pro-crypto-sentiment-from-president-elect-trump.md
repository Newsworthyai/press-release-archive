# StakingBonus Poised to Help Investors Capitalize as Bitcoin Surges to Record High of Nearly $80,000 Amid Pro-Crypto Sentiment from President-Elect Trump

Bitcoin (BTC) has hit an all time high of almost $80,000 after Donald Trump said he likes digital assets and will create a Bitcoin fund and appoint pro crypto regulators. The coin went up 4.3% to $79,771 in Singapore on Sunday and other major coins like Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) also went up. This is a great opportunity for investors, especially in crypto staking where platforms like StakingBonus can help find the highest paying options.
