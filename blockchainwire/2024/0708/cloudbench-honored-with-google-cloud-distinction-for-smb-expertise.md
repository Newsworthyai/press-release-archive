# Cloudbench Honored with Google Cloud Distinction for SMB Expertise

Saint Petersburg, FL, July 8, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cloudbench, a top Google Cloud partner and vertical AI consultancy, has been awarded a new Google Cloud expertise designation for the Small and Medium Business (SMB) segment. This accolade underscores Cloudbench's consistent success in delivering measurable business value and outcomes for its SMB startup and midmarket clients.

As part of a rigorous certification process, Google Cloud thoroughly evaluates each partner's client experience, professional certifications, and expertise in Google AI and Google Cloud. This process identifies top companies and recognizes those setting the standard in these crucial areas. Only the most qualified partners receive Google Cloud's esteemed Expertise designations, demonstrating exceptional technical proficiency and a proven track record of success.

"We established Cloudbench to deliver vertical solutions to the SMB sector because existing solutions from global system integrators were prohibitively expensive, required 8-12 months to implement, and catered only to large enterprises,” said Tom Richer, CEO of Cloudbench. “We are honored to receive the prestigious Google Cloud Expertise designation for SMB from Google Cloud, recognizing our focus and positive impact on this crucial segment. We are passionate about the SMB sector and will continue to invest in our packaged vertical solutions and certified expertise to provide rapid, high-value solutions to our clients."
