What is a BFG Token?BFG is a native token of BetFury, launched on a BSC Chain (BEP-20) in June 2021. It has 67K+ holders who use BFG for trading, gaming, sports betting, staking, etc. More about BFG: https://betfury.com/about-bfg.

BFG got a CertiK certification on September 17, 2021 and also received a Curacao gaming license, leading to users' trust and reliability for all BFG holders.

BFG plays a vital role in the ecosystem and rises in market value due to the robust deflationary strategy. One of the fundamental points of this strategy is the direction of Gross Gaming Revenue to the BFG Staking pool, the main crypto utility.

How the BFG’s Past Impacts Its Tomorrow?The BFG token was launched to distribute the platform revenue and passive income to its owners. As the project scaled, the number of collaborations increased, providing additional utilities for BFG, including exchange and additional income for users.Tokens were mined by playing in a 1:1 ratio for the user and team. After the end of BFG mining in June 2023, the total supply amounted to 5B tokens. Along with the mining process, the primary utility of BFG was launched - revenue share. The BFG holders began to join this distribution mechanism.

Newly Launched Strategic BFG Deflationary MechanismAfter the end of BFG mining, BetFury focused on escalating the value of BFG. Stable and healthy tokenomics allowed the team to create a new deflationary strategy to accomplish this task. The new strategy involves repurchasing tokens from the market using the BetFury team's revenue.

BFG Buyback & Burn MechanismAre there other projects that spend 100% of the team’s revenue to support the native token? The team uses funds from the platform's revenue streams to buy back BFG from the market and conduct a monthly BFG burn, reducing the circulating supply.

Revenue streams:

- crypto staking penalty fee;

- crypto swap fee;

- borrowing liquidation and fee;

- Futures’ fee;

- staked BFG by the BetFury team.

BFG Buyback & LockBetFury's team buys back tokens from the circulating supply each month using funds generated from the mentioned revenue streams and stores them in a wallet known as the Treasury. Periodically, repurchased BFG tokens will be distributed as incentives to stBFG/BFG holders and active users.

How to Earn with BFG?Staking BFGBetFury offers BFG Staking with an opportunity to double rewards by converting BFG to stBFG (a special native token) with 0% fees. It provides up to 70% APY and daily payouts in BTC, ETH, BNB, USDT, and TRX. According to the mechanism for replenishing the BFG Staking pool, the part of GGR is distributed among BFG/stBFG holders in the pool. This way, the BetFury team can consistently support the pool’s profitability for users by providing a high APY. Additionally, the BetFury team has locked 1B BFG tokens for 3 years, opting not to benefit from the x2 APY but to earn from a regular APY in the BFG Staking pool.

- High passive income from BFG staking;

BFG Price PredictionAccording to Coincodex, the BFG price may increase by 228% and reach $0.0567 by June 6, 2024. Based on historical cycles, the platform determined the minimum and maximum values of BFG for 2025: $0.017284 and $0.081670. The upgraded tokenomics and deflationary strategy can support these positive dynamics. Such predictions have a good chance of coming true but it’s crucial to remember about market’s volatility. Experienced traders should keep their finger on the pulse and always conduct their own research.

ConclusionEcosystem upgrades are essential for any crypto platform competing for a leading position in the industry. That is why BetFury has updated its tokenomics and introduced a new deflationary model to empower its BFG token.
