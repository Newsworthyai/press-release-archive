The Okhotnikov Company Analyzes the Digital Currency Impact on the Upcoming 2024 Elections in the US: Important Amendments Regarding CBDC May Be Adopted A recent Forbes story reveals a new aspect: the impact of cryptocurrency on the American election campaign. Well-known crypto expert and supporter of libertarian views, Vladimir Okhotnikov, founder of the Okhotnikov company, expressed his deep thoughts on this matter in the article About Trump, the presidential elections in America and the launch of CBDC in 2024.

Vladimir Okhotnikov emphasized that the digital monetary equivalent is becoming a key circumstance in the election race. The expert noted: “a significant portion of voters consider the cryptocurrency adoption as a decisive factor in the US presidential elections in 2024.”

The company has been analyzing how the younger Generation Z and Millennials could influence the future of the US. The document suggests that their support could play a key role in the upcoming elections.

The crypto expert noted that in four states alone, about 1.9 million people have already voted in favor of decentralized finance (DeFi) and that this trend continues to intensify. He also cites Morning Consult research that shows 18% of Ohio, New Hampshire, Nevada and Pennsylvania residents own digital currency, and most of them tend to support pro-digital asset candidates.

Taking into account the cryptocurrency sentiments of the current US President, Vladimir Okhotnikov suggests that Trump has every chance of re-entering the White House as a winner.

Vladimir Okhotnikov talks about the dollar and regulators such as rating agencies and the Board on financial stabilityThe article also emphasizes that the dollar exists thanks to a small group of ruling elites. At the same time, there are fears that the global economic system is on the verge of default, which could be comparable to the 2008 crisis and mark the end of the long-term hegemony of the dollar.

In addition, experts note the emergence of their own rating agencies in the cryptocurrency world, such as Bluechip. However, there are doubts that their activities remain insufficiently transparent.

Vladimir Okhotnikov analyzed the creation by Congress of an entire advisory body of regulators, the Financial Stability Council (FSOC), which has the right to classify companies as subject to systemic risk, including in the cryptocurrency industry. This, according to Okhotnikov, creates significant challenges for the development and regulation of the cryptocurrency market.

The expert also suggested that the introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) could be an effective tool against cryptocurrencies. The conclusion is explained by the fact that regulators will be able to exercise control over the use of electronic money and introduce various restrictions, including monitoring transactions and blocking suspicious transfers.

Vladimir Okhotnikov also noted the positive trends in the integration of cryptocurrency into the economy, including the example of El Salvador’s decision to make Bitcoin a parallel official currency along with the US dollar. This step, according to Okhotnikov, shows the potential for innovation and attracting investment into the country’s economy.
