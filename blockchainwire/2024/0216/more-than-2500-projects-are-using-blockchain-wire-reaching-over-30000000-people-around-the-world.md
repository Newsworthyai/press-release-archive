# More than 2,500 Projects are Using Blockchain Wire, Reaching over 30,000,000 People around the World

Blockchain Wire, the premier press release distribution service specializing in disseminating news related to blockchain and cryptocurrency projects, today announced that more than 2,500 different such blockchain and crypto projects have used the service as clients.

Regardless of the fluctuations in cryptocurrency price and mainstream news interest, Blockchain Wire has been steadily growing in the last few years, with more and more projects signing up to inform their loyal communities of new developments while also expanding their message to new audiences that will make up the project communities of tomorrow.

“Our leadership position and experience allows us to serve our clients with unmatched access to the biggest media outlets, influencers, and thought leaders in this space,” said Blockchain Wire President Michael Shuler. “Regardless of the ebb and flow in blockchain and cryptocurrency as markets, the interest in reaching blockchain and cryptocurrency communities through Blockchain Wire has steadily grown ever since the company was founded. This growth indicates that the interest needed to sustain future blockchain and cryptocurrency initiatives is as strong as ever.”

Offering the lowest pricing in the industry, Blockchain Wire is the only major press release wire service with a flat-rate structure. This allows companies to pay one price, regardless of press release length, which can often spike costs by thousands of dollars based on only a few hundred more words.

Basic packages start at $195 and Blockchain Wire’s global reach includes broadcast and online media outlets, social media sites, industry trade publications, leading blogs, and influencers, including Yahoo Finance, Google News, and the Associated Press.

Blockchain Wire also recently partnered with knowledge asset platform OriginTrail to create a new AI product that will deliver company data, news, and insights to the financial community. This product is refining and expanding the Blockchain Wire audience to a whole new group of analysts and investors.

"Blockchain Wire is a one-stop shop for blockchain and crypto technologists to not only cost-effectively reach a broad audience of enthusiasts, but a highly targeted audience of potential investors as well,"  said Enzo Villani, co-founder of Blockchain Wire and CEO/founder of parent company Alpha Transform Holdings.

Blockchain Wire was founded by Michael Terpin, Shuler, and Villani in 2018. Terpin and Shuler previously founded Marketwire, one of the world’s largest company newswires. Villani was co-founder of Nasdaq’s Global Corporate Solutions, where he launched GlobeNewswire, which merged with MarketWire when Nasdaq acquired it. Digital asset organization Alpha Transform Holdings acquired Blockchain Wire last year.
