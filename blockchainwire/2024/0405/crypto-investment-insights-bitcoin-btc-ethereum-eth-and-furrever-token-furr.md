Bitcoin (BTC) Battles Resistance: Will it Surge Past $66,600 or Plummet Below $64,500?Bitcoin (BTC) is currently priced at around $66,383, holding steady compared to yesterday's rates. BTC continues to assert its dominance within the cryptocurrency market, striving to surpass the crucial $66,000 resistance level, which has emerged as a significant obstacle amidst recent volatility. However, concerns linger as BTC teeters close to the $64,500 mark, indicating potential downward momentum. Presently, BTC faces resistance around $66,500 and $67,000, trading below the $67,000 threshold and the 100-hour simple moving average.

On the hourly BTC/USD chart, a notable downtrend line near $66,400 poses a risk of breaching the $64,500 support zone. Following a descent to $64,500, Bitcoin enters a consolidation phase, briefly attempting to recover $66,572. Yet, this rebound struggles to surpass $66,000 amidst bearish pressure around $66,600.

Immediate resistance persists at $66,400, with primary resistance at $66,600. Overcoming this could signal a fresh uptrend, aiming for resistance near $68,750 and potential gains towards $70,000. In the face of market volatility, attention remains on Bitcoin's challenge to surpass the critical $66,600 resistance, the failure of which may result in further losses.

At present, Bitcoin hovers near $65,200, with immediate support expected at this level. However, breaching this could expose BTC to intense downward pressure. Initial significant support lies at $64,600, followed by $64,000, potentially paving the way for a descent towards $62,500 and signaling downside risks towards $60,500.

From a technical standpoint, the 4-hour MACD indicates a strengthening downward trend, while the RSI dipping below 50 suggests waning bullish momentum. With investors closely monitoring support and resistance levels, key support zones for Bitcoin are identified at $65,200 and $64,500, with significant hurdles ahead at $66,600, $67,000, and $67,950.

Ether Faces Uncertainty: Will Ethereum (ETH) Surge Beyond $3,679 or Plummet to $2,700 Amidst ETF Speculations?Amidst the dynamic fluctuations of the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) finds itself at a critical juncture. Ethereum's trajectory remains uncertain, with the current price hovering around $3,341, reflecting a modest 1% increase since yesterday.

On April 2nd, Ethereum experienced a dip below the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $3,414, a development reminiscent of Bitcoin's (BTC) recent movements. Additionally, the anticipation surrounding the approval of an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) has contributed to Ethereum's vulnerability to faster losses. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is actively working to dismantle the anticipated optimistic scenario.

As the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) turns downward towards $3,493, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) flirts with the oversold territory. Should Bitcoin fail to rapidly recover, Ethereum's price could potentially plummet to $2,700 on closures below $3,056.

Conversely, closures above the 50-day SMA, currently positioned at $3,679, could pave the way for Ethereum to target $4,000. As investors navigate through these uncertain waters, Ethereum's fate hinges on a delicate balance of market sentiment, regulatory developments, and the broader cryptocurrency landscape.
