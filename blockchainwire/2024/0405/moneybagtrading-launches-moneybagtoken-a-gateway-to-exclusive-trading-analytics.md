# MoneyBagTrading Launches MoneyBagToken - A Gateway to Exclusive Trading Analytics

The MoneyBagTrading team has announced the launch of its highly anticipated MoneyBagToken. This new cryptocurrency will grant holders access to the innovative MoneyBagTrading platform, offering exclusive trading analytics in a user-friendly format.

The project foresees a private beta launching later this year and a public release planned for 2025. MoneyBagToken intends to give traders an edge in the crypto market. The project has already partnered with top industry players and has a clear roadmap for future developments.

The Launch of MoneyBagTokenThe launch of MoneyBagToken ($MNYBG) has the main appeal as a utility token that grants access to the MoneyBagTrading platform. This platform contains actionable data for traders, presented in a useful way.

An automated system will determine price action and identify good entry zones.

To buy $MNYBG, traders can get an AVAX wallet from traderjoexyz.com and swap $AVAX for $MNYBG. The token maximum supply will be 100M, with a 10% allocation for the development team and no presale or ICO.

The project will lock liquidity and implement a 1.5% trade tax to support the token's growth and stability.

During the beta stage, token holders will have exclusive access to the platform. This is the immediate benefit and incentive for buying $MNYBG in the short term. The platform plans to attract more traders and increase demand for $MNYBG in the long run.

Future ProjectsThe project's roadmap has four phases. The first phase, which is already over, involved releasing the $MNYBG token.

Currently, the project is in phase two, focused on marketing efforts to gain more exposure for the token. In 2024-2025, phase three will see the release of the MoneyBagTrading platform. This will represent the project's core, offering users a platform to trade and utilize their $MNYBG tokens.

Phase four will take place in 2025. At this point, the team plans to continue developing trading tools and releasing the $MNYBG token on Centralized Exchanges (CEXs).
