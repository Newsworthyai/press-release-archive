The launch of the public testnet will introduce various innovative tools, including mobile apps, browser extensions, testnet faucets, a blockchain explorer, and performance monitoring tools.

The UPCX Wallet is currently in a closed network testing phase and is not yet available to the general public. This rigorous testing ensures that the wallet's functionalities will operate as planned and meet the highest security standards before public release. The development team has indicated that once the test is fully built and operating smoothly, the testnet will be opened up for user experience.

Key features of the UPCX Wallet include:
