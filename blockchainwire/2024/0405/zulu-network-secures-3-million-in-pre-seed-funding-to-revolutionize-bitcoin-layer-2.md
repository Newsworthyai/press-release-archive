Introducing Zulu Network

As a pioneer in the realm of Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions, boasting a unique two-tiered architecture, the platform supports both EVM and UTXO, paving the way for revolutionary advancements within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

As the first to pioneer a dual-layer architecture on Bitcoin (L2 & L3), Zulu Network introduces:

ZuluPrime (EVM): an EVM-compatible L2 platform aimed at building a new BitFi (Bitcoin DeFi) ecosystem through smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).

ZuluNexus (UTXO): a L3 platform that integrates the scalability of UTXO and focuses on innovation of Bitcoin’s original ecosystem and native assets.

Decentralized Bitcoin Bridge Infrastructure: Zulu Network is building the first decentralized Bitcoin bridges to connect all Bitcoin Layer 2s and the entire crypto ecosystem to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Zulu is building and empowering a wide ecosystem within the Bitcoin economy, allowing native Bitcoin assets to engage with sophisticated DeFi applications and Financial Services, while preserving the original security, reliability, and capabilities of the Bitcoin Network.

“Zulu Network's innovative dual-layer network structure within the Bitcoin ecosystem not only provides users with more stable and innovative services but also offers tremendous value and potential for DeFi applications. The EVM compatibility and smart contract functionality of ZuluPrime, along with the hybrid design of UTXO and account types in ZuluNexus, represent new directions for the future development of the Bitcoin ecosystem” - Steve Chiu, founder of CGV, a leading blockchain investment and fund of funds (FoF).

This funding will initiate a new era of BitFi (Bitcoin DeFi) and expand the potential of Bitcoin native assets across the whole crypto space. Specifically, the areas that Zulu will focus on are:

* · Dual-layer Architecture: The Zulu Network will use its funding to enhance the infrastructure of ZuluPrime and ZuluNexus, focusing on EVM compatibility, UTXO scalability, and smart contract functionality to create a versatile platform for DeFi applications.
* · Decentralized Bitcoin Bridge Advancement: As the first to build a fully decentralized Bitcoin Bridge, Zulu Network will allocate a substantial amount of effort into advancing its bridge infrastructure capabilities, connecting not only all Bitcoin Layer 2, but also the whole crypto industry to Bitcoin through a unique bridge architecture.
* · Ecosystem Expansion: Investment in ecosystem expansion aims to attract developers for innovative BitFi applications and establish strategic partnerships, broadening the adoption and utility of Bitcoin DeFi.
* · Research & Development (R&D): Zulu Network allocates funds towards research and development focused on Bitcoin, aiming to explore new technologies and methodologies that enhance Bitcoin's capabilities and integration within the Zulu architecture.

It is reported that the Alpha version of the Zulu Network Test Network will be launched on April 5th. The Test Network focus will be on BitFi development and support of BTC native assets while maintaining the security, reliability, and functionality Bitcoin is known for.

“This is just the beginning for Zulu Network,” says Eric Lifson, Co-Founder at Zulu Network. “We are very excited about having the opportunity to revolutionize the Bitcoin Network and want to give special thanks to all investors participating in this funding. We are not just building a Layer 2. We are creating a whole new infrastructure on top of Bitcoin. This year marks the beginning of a BitFi revolution, with Zulu Network at the forefront of BTC innovation. The Zulu Network ecosystem will realize what everyone dreamed decentralization could become.”

Zulu Network invites everyone to join their mission to revolutionize the Bitcoin economy together and is planning to release an exciting ecosystem Point System for community participation soon.
