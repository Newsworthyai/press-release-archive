# Beats on Base Releases Progress Update of its Revolutionary Meme Music Project and New AI Agents

Beats on Base, an AI project built on Coinbase’s Base Chain, revealed new details about its groundbreaking Meme Music Beats on Base project. This initiative aims to manage the project and generate music and visual content through proprietary AI tools called AI Agents.

Beats on Base seeks to bridge AI, crypto, and the meme culture into a financially lucrative project that pushes technological barriers. It is the first project of its kind to lay progress in the hands of AI agents. These innovative tools are built with cutting-edge AI technology to work for the project’s community, generate content, and increase brand awareness. Users can contact the friendly AI agents by phone, via the website, or on the project’s Telegram and X (Twitter) accounts.

The Meme Music Beats on Base project is rapidly evolving under the leadership of Beats the Koala, the platform's main AI agent. Its new Meme Music Video marketing strategy will see AI agents create songs and music videos. According to the latest update, Beats the Koala will star in daily generated music clips designed to reward the community with excitement and fun. Additionally, these videos will increase the brand’s presence and recognition.

Branding is an essential development area for Beats on Base. Custom Base Chain Branding is promoted to highlight its AI Agents' technical capabilities. By using custom-trained FLUX LORAs, the project reliably reproduces company branding while boasting broad potential and utility across all consumer advertising sectors. This AI tool surpasses the capabilities of publicly available AI image generators, which cannot produce brand-specific logos and product labeling.

The project also focuses on community and project management through the innovative use of AI Agents. Ultimately, Beats on Base aims to build more than just technological prowess. It also seeks to nurture a community rooted in creativity, inclusivity, and humor, led and managed by a team of AI Agents.

Lord Business, one of the recently introduced Based Agents, is a financially capable and independent AI tool equipped to share the project's tokens, $BEATS. This AI Agent can do so without human help and spearheads the project’s vision for innovation and efficiency. More precisely, Lord Business is in charge of autonomous interaction, token distribution, and subsequent community growth.
