Tackling Fuel Poverty Through Innovation

SDUK targets private rental housing sector, where millions of UK homes are now classified as in fuel poverty.

SDUK programme is to deliver EndoTherm energy saving technology to the private rental housing sector gas boilers, which result in reducing energy cost by 15% which is delivered at NO COST to the tenant, landlord and government subsidies.

Installing EndoTherm generates 3 high integrity UK carbon credits which are sold at a premium on the Voluntary Carbon Market due these credits been based on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Maths) methodologies, whilst also been embedded into the auditable and verifiable UK housing stock. In addition to the high Socio-Economic Impact of CO2 reduction, fuel poverty alleviation and green jobs creation.

The15% energy reduction achieved, reduces the carbon emissions by an average of 3 tonnes per property over a 10-year period. Our targeted delivery of 1.5m will reduce carbon emissions by 4.5M/t.

UK legislation requires every Registered Social & Private Landlord to annually service the properties gas boiler. This legislation is a key driver assisting SDUK meeting the installation targets as this is a mandatory requirement for private landlords.

The SDUK model fully funds energy-efficient installations and captures resulting carbon savings as UK high-integrity carbon credits (HICC). These credits serve as sustainable financial cornerstones, specifically, they will enable the project to scale up to 5 million homes within the next five years.
