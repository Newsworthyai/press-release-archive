# Honk The new memecoin sensation set to become the Shiba of Solana!

Honk, a SOL memecoin, was launched on January 13th. It experienced incredible price growth, surging from a market cap of a few thousand to multimillions in just a few days.Honk draws inspiration from the famous memes surrounding the Untitled Goose video game. Hilarious memes featuring a goose wearing a knife, stealing items, and honking at everything went viral a few years ago, creating a substantial community of enthusiasts.It's worth noting that Honk is the nemesis of Bonk, another meme featuring a dog with a baseball bat. This rivalry extends to the crypto world, as Bonk is also a memecoin on the Solana blockchain with significant market capitalization. The Honk vs. Bonk battle in the meme sphere has now translated into a competition between the two memecoins on the Solana blockchain, adding a humorous touch to the crypto space.![](https://api.blockchainwire.io/uploads/GuruMarketing/editor_image/822ebeea-b75c-4d80-87b6-687ef5c70761.jpeg)

However, $HONK aims to be more than just a part of this rivalry; it aspires to become the Shiba Inu of Solana. Since memecoins became a thing, there have been two major trends: dog tokens, represented by Doge and Shiba Inu, and frog tokens, represented by Pepe the Frog. Given the popularity of geese in memes, Honk could initiate a third phase, making it the ultimate goose meme.Shiba Inu was built as the official rival of Dogecoin. Similarly, we can find a comparable narrative with Honk, placing it as the natural rival of Bonk.The project quickly gained momentum, attracting an active community. The Telegram group is growing, and the community remains engaged. As community support played a pivotal role in the success of Shiba Inu, Honk appears to have a promising future.$HONK is tradable on Raydium and Jupiter, two decentralized exchanges on the Solana network, with no taxes applied to transactions. The project plans to be listed on centralized exchanges in the future for increased visibility and trading options. The team demonstrates extensive connections and experience in the crypto space.Considering these factors, Honk seems to be a promising project. Time will tell if it can replicate Shiba's success, and it's important to conduct your research before investing. Trade safely, and may the goose force be with you!Socials:Website: [https://honk.lol/](https://honk.lol/)Telegram: [t.me/honk_sol](//t.me/honk_sol)X (Twitter): [https://x.com/honk_sol](https://x.com/honk_sol)Disclaimer: The token is not endorsed by and has no affiliation with House House or Panic Inc. Disclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.
