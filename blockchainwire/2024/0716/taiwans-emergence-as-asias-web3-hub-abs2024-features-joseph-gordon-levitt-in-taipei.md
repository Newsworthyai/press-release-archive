Taiwan as Asia’s Web3 Hub

Taiwan has long been at the forefront of technology discussions. Recently, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang described the vibrant island as one of the most important places in the world for being the center of the AI and computing revolution. These technological advancements are bolstered by an open and collaborative policy for Web3 builders and founders. In 2023, stablecoin issuer Circle partnered with Taiwan FamilyMart and BitoGroup to introduce a “Points-to-Crypto” service, democratizing access to cryptocurrencies.

Highlighting Taiwan’s position as a Web3 hub, Stan Shih, Co-Founder of ACER, a world-renowned leader in the ICT industry, will speak on digital art and digital assets at ABS2024. He will be sharing how he envisions bringing Taiwan into the future through digital creativity and the arts. ASUS Metaverse, a pioneering company collaborating with top-tier global partners to build transformative Web 3 ecosystems, will have a large area at the ABS2024 exhibition center to showcase their latest Web3 innovations.

Adding to Taiwan's technological momentum, a key highlight at ABS2024 will be the announcement of the Blockchain Roadmap by Far Eastern International Bank, one of Taiwan's leading financial institutions. This roadmap, set to be unveiled on the ABS2024 Mainstage on August 8, will emphasize Taiwan’s pivotal role in tech and finance innovations. Jacklyn Tsai, Honorary Chairwoman of Taiwan FinTech Association will speak on developments in finance.

"Through public-private cooperation, we have made significant strides in regulation while nurturing top-tier technical talent and the crypto industry," said Ju Chun Ko, Legislator of Taiwan’s Legislative Yuan. "This represents our ability to maintain a leading international role, not only as a global center for semiconductors and AI but also in advancing decentralization in the Web3 era. Taiwan is the heart of Asia’s blockchain industry."
