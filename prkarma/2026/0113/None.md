# HSR Featured in Canada National Observer for Zero Waste Leadership

PORT COQUITLAM, BC / PR Karma / January 13, 2026 11:15

HSR Zero Waste is featured in Canada National Observer in an article focused on the operational and financial value of zero waste strategies for Canadian organizations.

 The feature highlights HSR’s evolution from a family run recycling company founded in 1989 to a national zero waste leader supporting organizations across Canada. As recycling systems and regulations have grown more complex, HSR has expanded its approach to combine on the ground operational services with strategic and data driven consulting.

 Today, HSR operates through two complementary divisions. HSR Services delivers waste collection labour and on site sorting programs across Metro Vancouver. HSR Zero Waste provides national zero waste audits system redesign diversion reporting and support for sustainability certifications.

 The article also profiles HSR Zero Waste’s work with the Vancouver Convention Centre. Through a comprehensive waste audit and system redesign HSR helped increase the venue’s diversion rate from approximately fifty percent to more than eighty percent. In 2024 alone over one million kilograms of material were diverted from landfill while reducing collection frequency and improving overall efficiency.

 This project has become a replicable model for large scale venues and events and was recognized with a Clean50 Top Project award underscoring the impact that practical zero waste strategies can deliver.

 Across Canada HSR Zero Waste continues to work with airports shopping centres universities hospitals manufacturers and local governments. These projects demonstrate how thoughtful waste system design can reduce costs improve operational performance and support long term sustainability goals.
