 What: Tidbits of Change Award & Bursary Presentation Who: Cassie McNutt, Kamloops When: Friday, Feb. 20, 9:30 a.m. to 10 a.m. Where: Delta Hotel Kamloops, 540 Victoria St., Kamloops, B.C. RSVP: Greg Scott, gs@tidbitsofchange.org

 KAMLOOPS, B.C. — A Kamloops youth will be honoured next week by the Tidbits of Change Foundation for her work on a community charity initiative developed in collaboration with her parents.

 Cassie McNutt will receive a Tidbits of Change Award and youth bursary during a presentation scheduled for Feb. 20 in Kamloops.

 Each year, the Tidbits of Change Foundation recognizes three Canadian youth who partner with a parent or mentor on projects that demonstrate initiative, leadership and community impact. Successful applicants receive bursaries ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 to support their education.

 “Every year we hear from young Canadians doing remarkable things alongside a parent or mentor,” said Hali ScottSmith, co-founder of the foundation. “The projects are inspiring, and they often have a meaningful impact on their communities.”

 McNutt is being recognized for her role in launching and expanding an annual charity initiative in Kamloops. What began as a clothing drive connected to a Christmas light display she created with her father has since evolved into Cassie’s Charity Drive, an annual fundraiser supporting the Kamloops Hospice Society.

 “Our bursary selection committee was impressed by Cassie’s initiative and commitment,” said Greg Scott, co-founder of the Tidbits of Change Foundation. “She identified a need in her community and, with the support of her parents, turned that idea into a sustained effort that has grown year after year.”

 McNutt’s fundraising efforts have raised more than $260,000 for hospice services over the past four years. Her work has also been recognized nationally, earning her the King Charles III Coronation Medal, making her one of the youngest recipients in Canada.

 The Tidbits of Change Foundation is now accepting applications for its 2026 youth bursaries. The application period runs until April 30th. More information is available at tidbitsofchange.org.
