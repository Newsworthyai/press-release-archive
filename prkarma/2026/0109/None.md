# Father, daughter ski all Saskatchewan ski hills in 10 days

NORTH BATTLEFORD, SK / PR Karma / January 9, 2026 16:15

NORTH BATTLEFORD, Sask., Jan. 9, 2026 — A history-making ski adventure wrapped up in Saskatchewan this week, where a father and daughter skied all 11 lift-serviced ski areas in the province in just 10 days.

 Greg Scott and his daughter, Hali, have now skied every lift-serviced ski area in British Columbia (44), Alberta (39) and Saskatchewan (11), under the banner The Skadi Tour.

 The pair began and ended the Saskatchewan leg of their journey at Table Mountain Ski Resort, zigzagging across the province to visit every ski area. Along the way, they met local ski legends and shared their stories on Instagram @tidbitsofchange.

 The concept for the tour emerged two years ago while Scott and his daughter were organizing school visits across B.C. to promote the Tidbits of Change Foundation youth bursaries and encourage Canadian youth to collaborate with a parent or mentor on meaningful projects. They decided to ski every ski area in the province and became the first people to do so in a single winter, completing the B.C. tour in 42 days.

 “Our whole adventure has been incredibly rewarding,” said Scott. “It’s the combination of strong ski communities and the inspiring people who make each area special.”

 The Western Canada tour has drawn significant attention on social media, generating more than 3.5 million interactions on Instagram, including through their “Chairlift Chatter” series featuring local ski personalities at each hill.

 A central goal of the project is to inspire youth to pursue their own initiatives with the support of a parent or mentor.

 “We’re excited to hear the stories submitted for our youth bursaries this year,” Scott said.

 The Tidbits of Change Foundation awards $5,000 and $1,000 youth bursaries annually to Canadian youth who complete initiatives in collaboration with a parent or mentor. Examples of past recipients and submission details are available at tidbitsofchange.org.

 About the Tidbits of Change Foundation

 The Tidbits of Change Foundation is a volunteer-driven not-for-profit organization that encourages Canadian youth to collaborate with parents or mentors on community-focused initiatives. The foundation is based on the belief that mentorship-driven collaboration benefits young people and strengthens communities, particularly when those efforts create positive impact or inspire others. More information is available at tidbitsofchange.org.

 The unique name for The Skadi Tour is a nod to the Norse mythology goddess of snow, skiing, and mountains. The tour was made possible with the support of HEAD skis, Kal-Tire, and Descente, who have also added special youth bursaries to the Tidbits of Change Foundation efforts.
