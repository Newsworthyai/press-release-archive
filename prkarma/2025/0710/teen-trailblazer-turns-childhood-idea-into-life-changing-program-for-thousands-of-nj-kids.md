Teen Trailblazer Turns Childhood Idea into Life-Changing Program for Thousands of NJ Kids

 WILLINGBORO, NJ — At just 8 years old, Chloe Worthy didn’t wait for permission to lead—she created something bold and new: Club Cool Kids, a youth-powered program that has since impacted over 3,000 children across Burlington County. Now, as Chloe heads to the United States Military Academy Preparatory School at West Point, the future of youth leadership looks brighter than ever.

 Chloe’s journey began in the after-school program of All Things Are Possible Foundation (ATAP)—a nonprofit that serves over 500 children annually through academic, athletic, and cultural enrichment programs in Burlington County.

 “I wanted a space where kids could just be kids—have fun, make friends, and explore new things in a safe environment that was away from the parents and didn’t feel like school,” said Chloe. “There were plenty of structured programs, but nothing that truly felt like a place for us—led by kids, for kids, with our interests at the forefront.”

 From Dream to Dynamic Program What began as a fun idea among a few friends soon evolved into a full-fledged program with science experiments, culinary workshops, engineering challenges, and cultural activities like Black History Month spotlights. Sessions were held twice a month, often drawing 40 to 50 children each time.

 More than just activities, Club Cool Kids became a hub of creativity, friendship, and confidence-building—one that gave kids agency in their own learning.

 “We asked the kids what they wanted to explore,” Chloe explained. “That’s what made it work. It wasn’t something done to them—it was built with them, and their opinions, in mind.”

 The success of Club Cool Kids is deeply rooted in ATAP’s mission: to help young people discover what’s possible for their lives by expanding their exposure, education, and leadership opportunities.

 The Confidence to Create Chloe credits her father, Dr. Carlos Worthy, and her mother, Dr. Tiffani Worthy, both U.S. Army veterans and co-founders of ATAP, with giving her the inspiration and courage to lead.

 “My family came into Willingboro and started ATAP from the ground up. Watching them create something meaningful for teens inspired me to do something for kids my age,” Chloe shared. “She showed me that when you have a vision for a better future it’s up to you to hone that and create the future that you want to see.”

 What started as $20-a-session Friday meetups grew into a must-attend program, supported by community volunteers, visiting experts, and local partnerships. Along the way, Chloe learned how to plan events, manage logistics, and communicate with peers and adults—skills she’s now taking with her to West Point.

 The Legacy Continues Chloe may be heading off to serve her country, but she isn’t done with Club Cool Kids. In fact, she sees potential for expansion.

 “I hadn’t thought about it before,” she said, “but I realize now that Club Cool Kids could exist anywhere—on a military base, in a library, at a youth center. Kids everywhere need this.”

 She envisions Club Cool Kids chapters sprouting up wherever youth need a safe, exciting place to belong. And with ATAP’s ongoing support, there’s momentum for turning her vision into a national model.

 “ATAP has been like a second home. It’s not just a program—it’s family,” she said. “To know I helped create something that gave other kids joy, confidence, and community? That’s everything.”

 A Call to Listen to Young Voices More than anything, Chloe wants people to know that youth voices matter—and that leadership doesn’t have to wait until adulthood.

 “If I hadn’t spoken up, Club Cool Kids wouldn’t exist,” she said. “Sometimes it just takes one voice, one hand raised, to spark something bigger than you could ever imagine.”

 As ATAP continues to empower youth across Burlington County and beyond, Chloe Worthy is a shining example of what happens when kids are given the tools—and the trust—to lead.
