# Joanne Gore Honoured with Two Digital Reference Awards, Returns to PRINTING United Expo 2025

TORONTO, ON / PR Karma / September 16, 2025 1:45

Joanne Gore, President and Chief Strategist of Joanne Gore Communications (JGC), has been recognized with two major accolades from the Digital Reference Awards: Best Content Marketing Consultant Agency in Canada and Founder to Watch 2025. These awards highlight Gore’s track record of driving measurable business results through honest storytelling, strategic frameworks, and execution-focused content marketing. Building on this momentum, Joanne returns to PRINTING United Expo 2025 to help printers navigate today’s evolving landscape with clarity and confidence. Taking place October 22–24 at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, FL., the event will feature Gore as a speaker, moderator, and panelist in three key educational sessions focused on driving revenue, embracing accessibility, and turning disruption into opportunity.

 Joanne has also been added to the inaugural PRINTING United Expo 2025 All-Stars Team, a distinction honouring her industry leadership, her ability to connect with audiences, and her active engagement in shaping the conversations that matter most.

 As part of the PRINTING United educational program, Joanne will be presenting and moderating sessions that confront the rapidly changing realities of today’s print landscape – where fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) is stalling growth, forcing knee-jerk decisions, and pushing overwhelmed teams to try to “do it all themselves.” Fresh off her recognition as Best Content Marketing Consultant Agency in Canada and Founder to Watch 2025, Gore brings her award-winning strategies directly to print businesses looking to thrive in a digital and data-driven world, with sessions built to offer clarity, actionable strategies, and real-world guidance.

 Joanne’s “Thriving in Chaos” methodology has already made waves across Canada. Following her recent appearance at an Ontario Printing and Imaging Association (OPIA) event, attendees expressed appreciation for her direct, no-fluff approach.

 “Joanne spoke at our OPIA event at Graphics Canada, and she delivered exactly what our members needed,” Heather Black, Founder of Freely Connect Recruitment and Board Member of Ontario Printing & Imaging Association, said. “Her ‘Thriving in Chaos’ presentation was practical, insightful, and full of takeaways our printers could apply right away. Joanne has a way of cutting through the noise and speaking to the realities of running a business in today’s digital world.”

 Joanne will deliver a solo presentation as part of the Paid Education track; she will also moderate a panel on Accessibility, and participate in the wrap-up discussion within the Enterprise Print track.

 Joanne Gore's Sessions at PRINTING United Expo 2025:

 Thriving in Chaos: How to Make Money as a Printer in a Digital World  Wednesday, October 22 | 11:00 AM – 11:50 AM | Room S320D

 In this solo presentation, Joanne addresses how today’s printers can drive revenue by combining digital and physical marketing tactics, enhancing personalization through AI, and aligning messaging with buyer behavior. The session unpacks how the “power of print” connects with modern engagement metrics and offers a clear framework to move from survival mode to strategic growth.

 Accessibility Reality Check: Finding Opportunities in Accessible Personalization  Thursday, October 23 | 12:00 PM – 12:45 PM | Room S320E/F

 Moderated by Joanne, this panel explores the intersection of accessibility and personalization in enterprise and customer communications. Attendees will gain insights into how accessibility, once seen as a compliance hurdle, is fast becoming a business differentiator. The panel will cover the tools, technology, and mindset required to make content inclusive and profitable.

 Enterprise Print Wrap-up: The Big Takeaways and What to Do Next  Thursday, October 23 | 2:00 PM – 2:45 PM | Room S320E/F

 This interactive wrap-up brings together moderators and attendees for an open discussion on the most impactful ideas from the day’s Enterprise Print sessions. The conversation will focus on how to put key insights into practice, what educational gaps remain, and how to turn inspiration into action.

 “The conversations I want to have in Orlando are honest and practical,” said Joanne Gore, President and Chief Strategist of Joanne Gore Communications. “We’re in a time where people are making decisions out of fear. They’re pulling back on marketing when they should be doubling down. These sessions are about facing that fear, leaning into the opportunity, and helping printers thrive, not just survive, in the chaos.”

 PRINTING United Expo 2025 offers an unparalleled opportunity to learn from industry leaders like Joanne, explore new technologies, and engage in the conversations shaping the future of print. Use code GORE25 for free admission to the Expo.
