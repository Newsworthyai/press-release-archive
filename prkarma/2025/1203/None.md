FERNIE, B.C. — Three young Canadians are being recognized by the Tidbits of Change Foundation for partnering with a parent or mentor on inspiring projects and achievements.

 The foundation celebrates youths who collaborate with a parent or mentor on a meaningful project or adventure and awards recipients bursaries ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 to support their post-secondary education goals.

 “Every year we hear from Canadian youths doing incredible things with a parent or mentor,” said Hali ScottSmith, co-founder of the Tidbits of Change Foundation. “Our selection committee had a difficult task, but three individuals stood out this year. We’re proud to recognize their initiatives and support their education through these bursaries.”

 Fernie teen recognized for supporting siblings of children with special needs Amy Attalla, of Fernie, B.C., is receiving the 2025 Tidbits of Change Award for creating Sibshops Fernie. Inspired by her experience as a sibling of a younger sister with special needs, Attalla founded a non-profit organization that provides peer support to siblings of children with special needs.

 Leaning on the mentorship and shared understanding she has with her older sister Joy, and drawing on her mother’s background in special education and her father’s experience in camp leadership and business, Attalla developed workshops where siblings can connect, share experiences and take part in recreational activities.

 “Amy’s initiative has had a remarkable impact on her community,” said Greg Scott, co-founder of the Tidbits of Change Foundation.

 Toronto student honoured for launching youth film festival A Youth Inspiration Bursary Award, presented by HEAD/Tyrolia, is being awarded to Sho Kagawa Brooks, now a student at Toronto Metropolitan University, for co-founding the Sea to Sky Student Short Film Festival.

 Brooks and his partners worked closely with a mentor involved in the Whistler Film Festival and with their high school vice-principal to develop the festival, which has grown into a platform that empowers student filmmakers.

 “Sho saw an opportunity to create something meaningful, sought out mentorship to work with, and turned it into a platform that continues to inspire young storytellers,” said Greg Scott.

 Alberta student honoured for homelessness outreach with her father A Youth Inspiration Bursary Award, presented by Kal Tire, is being awarded to Kaelyn Smith, of Sherwood Park, Alta., now a student at Grant MacEwan University.

 Smith partnered with her father to support people experiencing homelessness, volunteering with The Mustard Seed, PAC Mission and Hope Mission. They plan to expand their daughter and dad efforts through a project focused on Skid Row in Los Angeles.

 “All three of these collaborative initiatives have made a meaningful impact in their communities,” Scott said. “Their stories are inspirational, and it’s wonderful to see how these projects have strengthened their relationships as well, an added win in today’s world”

 The hope of the Tidbits of Change Foundation is that a ripple effect continues, where these efforts and initiatives will in turn inspire others to do their own passion projects. The foundation is now accepting applications for its 2026 bursaries. The application period runs until April 30, 2026. More information is available at tidbitsofchange.org
