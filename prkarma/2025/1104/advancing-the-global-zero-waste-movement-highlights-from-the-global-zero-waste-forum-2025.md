# Advancing the Global Zero Waste Movement: Highlights from the Global Zero Waste Forum 2025

VANCOUVER, BC / PR Karma / November 4, 2025 12:00

The Global Zero Waste Forum 2025 brought together global sustainability leaders, policymakers, and innovators to advance the collective mission toward a circular, waste-free future. Representing Zero Waste Canada, our President Jamie Kaminski attended the forum as an official partner. He reflected on the forum as an extraordinary opportunity to connect with global leaders and witness the movement’s progress firsthand.

 Jamie was inspired by the enthusiasm and collaboration of participants, from established Zero Waste pioneers to emerging voices from around the world. He noted that while the forum highlighted Türkiye’s leadership in advancing Zero Waste initiatives, it also reinforced the international scope of the movement and the critical role that communities and organizations play in driving systemic change.

 The forum reaffirmed the Zero Waste Hierarchy 8.1, developed by the Zero Waste International Alliance (ZWIA), as the guiding framework for global Zero Waste policies and definitions. This milestone strengthens global alignment on what “Zero Waste” truly means by prioritizing prevention, reuse, and systemic solutions over disposal. Speakers emphasized that achieving Zero Waste requires addressing the root causes of waste and pollution while ensuring that economic and social systems make sustainability accessible, inclusive, and impactful.

 Across all sessions, participants and leading voices agreed that Zero Waste is not simply a waste management goal but a commitment to systemic change. It addresses the root causes of waste and pollution while protecting both human and environmental health.

 HSR Zero Waste works closely with Zero Waste Canada as part of a shared commitment to advancing the Zero Waste movement. Through ongoing collaboration on event and facility certification initiatives, both organizations continue to strengthen Canada’s leadership in building sustainable and circular systems.

 As the forum concluded, one question resonated deeply across all discussions:

 “If you are not for Zero Waste, how much waste are you for?” Elena Mateo, Zero Waste Costa Rica

 This sentiment captures the urgency and clarity the movement needs as we collectively push forward. HSR Zero Waste celebrates this global collaboration and remains dedicated to driving measurable impact through education, certification, and community action.
