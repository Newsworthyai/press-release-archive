# HSR Zero Waste’s Large-Scale Waste Transformation Project Earns National Recognition for Measurable Sustainability Impact

PORT COQUITLAM, BC / PR Karma / October 23, 2025 15:20

HSR Zero Waste has been recognized with the 2026 Clean50 Top Project Award for its Comprehensive Waste Management System Redesign and Implementation Project, a large-scale initiative that redefined how high-traffic facilities can transition toward zero waste operations.

 The project demonstrated that environmental performance can be achieved through operational redesign and resource management, without relying on new infrastructure or major capital investment.

 Driving Change Through Systems-Based Design Before HSR’s involvement, the facility’s waste diversion rate had plateaued at around 50 percent. HSR Zero Waste took control of all waste streams and introduced a comprehensive program combining operational redesign, data-driven planning, and on-site engagement.

 Key components included:

 * Conducting in-depth waste composition and equipment assessments to identify efficiency gaps
* Delivering internal zero waste training for operations and events staff
* Reconfiguring waste flows and reallocating existing equipment to optimize processing
* Launching an on-site sorting system designed to recover value from materials previously treated as waste

 The program achieved measurable results, boosting diversion rates to 75–90 percent on a consistent basis. In 2024, the project successfully diverted over one million kilograms of material from landfill and incineration.

 Innovation That Integrates, Not Interrupts Many sustainability programs require major infrastructure upgrades, HSR’s approach proved that operational change can deliver large-scale impact. The system was designed to fit seamlessly into existing workflows, maintaining day-to-day continuity while improving efficiency.

 The program also introduced clearer waste streams and contamination controls, improving compliance and data accuracy across departments. Through consistent communication, on-site training, and responsive adjustments, the implementation was smooth and collaborative, demonstrating that zero waste transformation can occur without disruption.

 A Scalable Model for Change The success of this project extends beyond a single site. HSR’s framework, which combines waste analytics, process design, and training, has been documented as a replicable model for facilities across Canada, including event venues, institutions, and commercial sites.

 HSR Zero Waste continues to help organizations across Canada design, implement, and manage customized zero waste programs. By combining on-the-ground experience with data-driven insight, HSR enables clients to achieve sustainable results that are practical, scalable, and measurable.
