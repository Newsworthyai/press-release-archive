ST. LOUIS, MO / PR Karma / May 16, 2025 14:20

St Louis, MO. (May 16, 2025) – RapidFire Safety & Security (RapidFire), a leader in the fire, life safety, and security industry has acquired Christopherson Fire Protection (Christopherson), a 40-year-old fire protection company based in Chino, California. This acquisition enhances RapidFire’s service capabilities and solidifies its presence in Southern California. Christopherson is RapidFire’s ninth acquisition in California.

 Christopherson Fire Protection was founded in 1985 by David Christopherson and was currently owned by his son, Eric. Christopherson has been serving Greater Los Angeles, Inland Empire, and San Diego County for over 40 years. The company specializes in the design, installation, inspection, and maintenance of fire sprinkler systems, kitchen fire suppression systems, fire extinguishers, emergency lighting, backflow devices, and hood and duct cleaning services. Christopherson is an authorized distributor for ANSUL and AMEREX systems.

 With thousands of fire systems under recurring inspection and repair across Southern California, Christopherson was built on a foundation of safety and personalized customer service—values that continue to guide them today. Their continued growth is driven by dedicated sales efforts, customer referrals, and the reputation they’ve earned over the past 40 years. Christopherson’s team will continue to deliver exceptional service to their clients, now with the added support and resources of RapidFire.

 “Christopherson Fire Protection is a great fit to our established reputation in the Southern California market,” said John De Sousa, RapidFire’s Western General Manager. “With the addition of Christopherson’s experience, we continue our rapid growth trajectory in our region and further expand our presence throughout the Southern California marketplace. Our commitment to partnering with businesses like Christopherson’s expands our services and aligns with our people-centric, family-built strategy.”

 “In 1985, David Christopherson started Christopherson Fire Protection with one simple promise: to keep people safe. For over forty years, that promise has guided everything we do. Dave always said, “Every customer is a member of a family—treat them like one of ours.” That belief became the heart of our company, shaping how we show up, how we serve, and how we care.” said Eric Christopherson, Owner of CFP. “Today, we’re proud to honor Dave’s legacy by joining forces with one of the most respected names in fire safety: RapidFire. This partnership means broader services, deeper resources, and new opportunities to protect what matters most. But some things will never change—like our commitment to treating every customer like family. We’re still here. Still committed. Still keeping Dave’s promise—just with more ways to serve you than ever before.”

 “We are excited to welcome Christopherson Fire Protection to the RapidFire family,” said Brian Modglin, Chief Operating Officer of RapidFire Safety & Security. “Their exceptional expertise and dedication to protecting lives and property strengthen our capabilities in the California market. This acquisition enhances our ability to deliver comprehensive fire safety solutions while fostering growth and opportunity for our team and clients.”
