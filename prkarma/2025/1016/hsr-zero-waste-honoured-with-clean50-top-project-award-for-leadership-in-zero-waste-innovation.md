TORONTO, ON / PR Karma / October 16, 2025 15:30

HSR Zero Waste is proud to announce that it has won the 2025 Clean50 Top Project Award, recognizing the company’s Convention Centre Zero Waste Transformation Project as one of Canada’s most impactful sustainability initiatives this year.

 Led by President Jamie Kaminski, and supported by the HSR Zero Waste team and the Convention Centre teams, the project showcased how large-scale facilities can transition toward circular operations through customized zero waste planning, stakeholder engagement, and continuous improvement. By addressing complex waste streams and creating data-driven strategies, the initiative achieved measurable reductions in landfill contributions while improving recycling and composting outcomes.

 The Clean50 Top Project Awards celebrate initiatives across Canada that demonstrate measurable sustainability impact and leadership. This recognition highlights HSR Zero Waste’s ongoing commitment to helping organizations achieve practical, lasting zero waste solutions that drive both environmental and operational results.

 Representing HSR Zero Waste at the Clean50 Summit and Award Ceremony in Toronto are founders Stan and Della Kaminski, who accepted the award on behalf of the entire HSR team.

 “This recognition reflects the dedication and collaboration behind every project we take on,” said Jamie Kaminski, President of HSR Zero Waste. “We’re proud to share this success with our community and everyone who continues to support the journey toward a circular, waste-free future.”

 A Humble Start with a Recycling Heart The story of HSR Zero Waste began with its parent company, HSR, founded more than four decades ago. On January 1, 1980, HSR founder Stan Kaminski, alongside his partner Della, began their recycling journey by collecting newspapers from local hotels to raise money for the Gibsons Boys Club. What began as a small act of community care grew into a lifelong mission to reduce waste and do things differently.

 “It’s amazing to look back and see how far we’ve come — from collecting newspapers with a pickup truck to leading national zero waste projects,” said Stan Kaminski, Founder of HSR Zero Waste. “This award is not just for us, but for everyone who believes in making a real difference, one program at a time.”

 Building on these strong roots, Jamie Kaminski founded HSR Zero Waste in 2019, expanding the organization’s vision to help modern businesses achieve circularity and measurable sustainability outcomes. Today, HSR Zero Waste provides zero waste planning for organizations across Canada and beyond, helping clients turn sustainability goals into tangible, data-driven results.
