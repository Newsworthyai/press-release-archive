# Sun Print Solutions Achieves SOC 2 Type II Certification, Elevating Standards for Secure Healthcare Communications

SALT LAKE CITY, UT / PR Karma / September 9, 2025 1:00

Sun Print Solutions, a leader in innovative print and direct mail services, is proud to announce that it has achieved SOC 2 Type II certification, marking a major milestone in its ongoing commitment to data security, privacy, and compliance, particularly for clients in the healthcare sector.

 In an industry where safeguarding protected health information (PHI) is not just a priority but a legal requirement, this certification affirms Sun Print Solutions’ ability to manage and protect sensitive data with the highest level of integrity.

 “Achieving SOC 2 Type II certification reinforces our unwavering commitment to secure, compliant, and high-quality print solutions, especially for clients in sensitive, highly regulated industries like healthcare”, RJ Deneau, Business Development Manager, at Sun Print Solutions says.

 SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls) is a framework developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) to evaluate how well a company safeguards customer data. A Type II certification involves a thorough audit of systems, procedures, and performance over time to verify that those controls are operating effectively.

 Achieving SOC 2 Type II certification is a multi-phase effort that requires months of preparation, implementation, and independent auditing. Sun Print Solutions engaged a third-party assessor to evaluate its policies, procedures, infrastructure, and operational practices over a defined period. The assessment verified that Sun Print met strict criteria across five trust principles: security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. This process not only tested Sun Print’s existing safeguards but also prompted refinements that further strengthened its data protection posture.

 From personalized appointment reminders to data-rich wellness campaigns, healthcare organizations rely on Sun Print Solutions for fully in-house print and mail services that meet the strictest privacy and compliance standards. The SOC 2 Type II certification ensures that clients can trust the output and the process.

 Sun Print Solutions also maintains its union certification and other industry-recognized compliance benchmarks, reinforcing its role as a reliable and secure partner across highly regulated sectors.

 Why Now?

 As organizations continue to scale their personalization efforts using variable data printing, the risk exposure grows. SOC 2 Type II certification ensures that Sun Print Solutions is ready for today’s privacy standards while also being equipped to meet the challenges of tomorrow.

 Achieving SOC 2 Type II certification is part of Sun Print Solutions’ broader, ongoing investment in maintaining the highest standards of data security and operational excellence. As data regulations evolve and client expectations grow, Sun Print remains committed to proactively strengthening its infrastructure, refining its internal controls, and leading with transparency. Clients can be confident that their data is handled with the same care, diligence, and integrity that define every aspect of the company’s operations.
