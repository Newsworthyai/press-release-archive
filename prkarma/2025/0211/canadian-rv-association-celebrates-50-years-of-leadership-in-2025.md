 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

 Burlington, ON – February 11th, 2025

 The Canadian Recreational Vehicle Association (CRVA) proudly marks its 50th anniversary in 2025, celebrating five decades of advocacy, innovation, and dedication to the Canadian RV industry.

 CRVA was formed in 1975 by a group of dedicated industry leaders who recognized the need for a unified voice to represent Canadian RV manufacturers and suppliers.

 In its early years, the Association focused on establishing quality standards, advocating for fair industry regulations, and fostering collaboration between manufacturers and dealers.

 As the RV industry grew, so did CRVA’s role, expanding its efforts to include consumer education, government advocacy, and strategic partnerships that would strengthen and promote the RV lifestyle across Canada.

 In 1997, the CRVA and the RVDA of Canada established Go RVing Canada, a national marketing initiative created to promote the RV lifestyle and inspire more Canadians to explore the freedom of RV travel.

 In 2013, CRVA, along with RVDA of Canada and several Provincial Campground Owners Associations across the country, worked to establish the Canadian Camping and RV Association (formerly Canadian Camping and RV Council) to help foster stronger collaboration between RV manufacturers, dealers, and campgrounds, further supporting the growth of Canada’s outdoor hospitality industry.

 To help celebrate CRVA’s 50th anniversary in a truly meaningful way, General Coach Canada, a longtime CRVA member, generously donated a brand-new 2025 25’ Citation Reward Travel Trailer. This incredible gift will not only be used to mark CRVA’s 50th-year milestone but will also provide the association an opportunity to give back to the broader community.

 CRVA's Board of Directors came together in a decision to wrap the RV in a custom design and use it as a platform to support a cause close to their hearts—Care Camps, a charitable organization that provides children with cancer the opportunity to experience the healing power of the outdoors by funding specialized oncology camps across North America.

 The RV will showcase a QR Code on its exterior sides that will direct potential donors to a landing page on Care Camp’s website, a portal for selling raffle tickets to win the RV and facilitate corporate sponsorships.

 The Canadian Recreational Vehicle Association has assured the charity that 100% of the proceeds will go directly to Care Camps for the entire year-long fundraising period.

“We are incredibly grateful for the generosity of General Coach Canada and the Canadian Recreational Vehicle Association,” said Gwynn Sullivan, Executive Director of Care Camps Foundation. “This initiative will make it possible for more kids to find joy, connection, and adventure at camp, giving them a chance to just be kids while receiving the care they need. We applaud CRVA for using their milestone celebration to give back in such a meaningful way.”

 The wrapped RV will be unveiled at CRVA’s The Toronto Spring Camping and RV Show, February 27 – March 2, 2025, for the first time with tickets available for purchase. Enter to Win a 2025 Citation Reward Travel Trailer and help support children with Cancer- Canada Helps

 "General Coach Canada has been a proud member of CRVA for decades, and we couldn’t think of a better way to support the Association’s 50th anniversary than by donating this special travel trailer,” said Roger Faulkner, President of General Coach Canada and an RV/MH Hall of Fame Member. “CRVA has played a vital role in strengthening the Canadian RV industry, and we’re honored to be part of this incredible milestone and help raise funds for Care Camps, an organization that makes a real difference in the lives of children with cancer.”

 After the Toronto RV Show, the RV will embark on a cross-country journey, beginning with the Moncton RV Show scheduled for March 13th-16th, before appearing at festivals and events in the year, that will serve to celebrate CRVA’s rich history, the joy of the RV Lifestyle and the RV Giveaway.

 In addition to the RV, CRVA has planned a variety of other special acknowledgments throughout 2025, including:

 * Special 50th Anniversary Logo – Honoring legacy and its commitment to the industry, CRVA has designed a special, commemorative new logo that will be utilized throughout the year.

 * Historical Retrospectives – Digitally recognizing key figures who have contributed to CRVA’s past success and memorization of key events that helped form the history of the CRVA.

 * Advocacy and Awareness Campaigns – Reinforcing CRVA’s mission to support safety and the industry with all levels of Government and our RV Industry Partners

 Shane Devenish, CRVA’s President commented that “CRVA’s 50th anniversary is a moment to celebrate not just the Association’s past achievements, but also to honor the many individuals and organizations that have contributed to our success in our 50 years”

 "This milestone is a testament to everyone who has ever served on our Board, our dedicated members, and the industry stakeholders who have supported us along the way,” said Marty Bloemberg, CRVA’s Chairman. "We are truly grateful to General Coach Canada for their extraordinary generosity, and to everyone who has been part of CRVA’s journey. This year is about celebrating our past, embracing our future, and sharing the joy of RVing with Canadians coast to coast.”

 As CRVA celebrates this milestone year, we invite everyone—industry partners, RV enthusiasts, and community supporters—to join us in making a difference. Whether by purchasing a raffle ticket, helping to spread the word, or exploring sponsorship opportunities for Care Camps, every contribution helps bring joy and healing to children with cancer.
