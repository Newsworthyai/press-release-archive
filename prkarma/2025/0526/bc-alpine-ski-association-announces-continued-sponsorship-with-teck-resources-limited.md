VANCOUVER, BC / PR Karma / May 26, 2025 16:00

Vancouver, B.C. (Monday May 26, 2025) — BC Alpine Ski Association is proud to announce a continued partnership with Teck Resources Limited (Teck) as the lead partner and major sponsor of alpine ski racing in British Columbia.

 Teck’s significant contributions over the next five years will have far-reaching and long-lasting effects on the development of ski racers in communities throughout BC.

 Teck has been a partner with BC Alpine and its 32 ski clubs and over 6,700 members since 2008, as the title sponsor of the Teck U14 and U16 race series, a provincial program for 11-to 16-year-old skiers from across the province. Teck will continue to play a large role in the success of over 50 ski race events hosted by BC ski clubs between December and April each year.

 Anders Hestdalen, CEO of BC Alpine, says that a huge part of BC Alpines success is that we have been able to sustain programming and support over decades, through ups and downs, and that’s how you end up as a successful organization and sport. We have very strong grassroots programming and medalists from World Championships and the Olympics. That is largely thanks to our Teck partnership that now will continue for another five years. Thank you, Teck and let’s build our communities even stronger!

 The unique relationship between Teck and BC Alpine is based on “community”. Teck employees are passionate and engaged in community activities and many are involved as volunteers or have children in BC Alpine clubs across the province.

 “Living in British Columbia offers an incredible opportunity to enjoy nature through activities like skiing and we are proud to support BC Alpine Ski Associations’ initiatives that engage youth across the province,” said Carleigh Whitman, Head of Social Performance & Indigenous Relations at Teck.

 The agreement between Teck and BC Alpine commences in the 2025–26 season and extends to 2030–2031.
