# ATAP Foundation Launches Scout Troop 611 in Partnership with Scouting America

BURLINGTON, NJ / PR Karma / August 21, 2025 6:10

WILLINGBORO, NJ — August 20, 2025 — The All Things Are Possible (ATAP) Foundation is proud to announce the launch of Scout Troop 611, a dynamic new partnership with Scouting America that brings a values-driven, adventure-filled program to youth in Willingboro this fall.

 Troop 611 will serve boys and girls ages 5–10, offering a safe and supportive environment where young people can grow through hands-on learning, leadership development, and outdoor exploration.

 “This troop is more than just an after-school activity—it’s a pathway to purpose,” said Dr. Tiffani Worthy, Executive Director of the ATAP Foundation. “At ATAP, we believe in empowering youth with the tools to lead, serve, and succeed. Scouting aligns perfectly with that mission, and Troop 611 will help us further unlock the potential in every child we reach.”

 Patrick Linfors, Scout Executive/CEO of the Garden State Council, emphasized the importance of the collaboration:

 “The Garden State Council is proud to partner with the All Things Are Possible Foundation because of our shared commitment to the health and well-being of young people. Together, we will help foster in the children we serve, character development, citizenship, personal fitness, and leadership skills.”

 The idea for the troop was sparked during ATAP’s after school program and again during Summer Empowerment Experience, where students participated in a live Scouting demonstration. The response was overwhelmingly positive, as children engaged in activities focused on teamwork, problem-solving, and outdoor skills—quickly discovering that Scouting is about far more than earning badges.

 Through this partnership with Scouting America, Troop 611 will offer youth the chance to:

 * Build character and confidence
* Learn essential life and leadership skills
* Experience hands-on community service
* Enjoy outdoor adventures and creative learning
* Develop a strong sense of responsibility and belonging

 Linfors added:

 “We are looking forward to bringing the fun and adventure of Scouting to a growing number of people in Burlington County. Scouting and ATAP are working together to produce the caring, happy, and successful adults our families, workplaces, and communities need.”

 Enrollment is now open for children ages 5–10 living in Willingboro and surrounding communities.
