 Burlington, ON – December 11, 2025

 The Canadian Recreational Vehicle Association (CRVA) was recently honoured with the We Care Corporate Award from Care Camps Foundation, recognizing the Association’s year-long fundraising and awareness initiative supporting pediatric oncology camps across Canada.

 The award was presented to CRVA’s President Shane Devenish during the RV Dealers Association (RVDA) Convention in Las Vegas by Gwynn Sullivan, Executive Director of Care Camps Foundation, in recognition of CRVA’s national effort tied to its 50th Anniversary celebrations.

 “Care Camps exists because of the outdoor industry and partners like CRVA who go above and beyond,” said Gwynn Sullivan, Executive Director of Care Camps Foundation. “CRVA’s 50th anniversary initiative exemplified what it means to lead with heart, and we are deeply grateful for their support and for the Canadian RV community that stood behind it.”

 Throughout 2025, CRVA travelled coast to coast with the CRVA 50th RV, generously donated by General Coach Canada, connecting with campground owners, dealerships, and community partners at events across the country in support of Care Camps Foundation, which supports medically supervised pediatric oncology camps for children and families

 “From the very beginning, we were clear about our goals for our 50th Anniversary,” said Marty Bloemberg, Chair of the Canadian Recreational Vehicle Association. “While we wanted to celebrate an important milestone and shine a light on the RV industry that we are so proud to be a part of, we wanted to find a way to give back in a meaningful way, and CRVA's Board was unanimous in its support of Care Camps.”

 The tour created countless opportunities for CRVA to connect with RVers, dealers, campground owners, and industry partners, many of whom shared personal stories, donated generously, and helped to amplify Care Camps' mission within Canada.

 “One of the greatest joys of our 50th anniversary year for me personally was meeting people face-to-face — hearing their RV stories and seeing their passion for camping first hand, but especially watching how quickly everyone rallied to support our mission this year with Care Camps,” said Shane Devenish, President of CRVA.

 When receiving the award in Las Vegas, CRVA emphasized that this recognition must be shared with RVDA of Canada, Go RVing Canada, and the Canadian Camping and RV Association, who were passionate about joining in their journey and whose support and ongoing advocacy, marketing, and community leadership continue to be instrumental in strengthening the RV and camping sector nationwide.

 “While we are tremendously honored, the recognition doesn’t belong to CRVA alone. It is truly to be shared with every dealer, campground owner, manufacturer, current RV owner, and everyone else who dropped by and said hello at one of the events, donated to Care Camps, shared our message, or simply encouraged us along the way,” continued Devenish.

 During CRVA’s most recent Board of Directors meeting, members and industry partners gathered to mark the occasion and reflect on the significance of the award — a moment captured in a group photo that underscores the shared commitment behind the initiative.

 As CRVA looks ahead beyond its 50th year, the Association reaffirmed its commitment to industry leadership, community engagement, and supporting causes like Care Camps that reflect the values of our community and the RV lifestyle.
