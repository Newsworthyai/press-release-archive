# Enchanting New Children’s Book Series, “Your Little Fairy” Launches on Kickstarter

TAMPA, FL / PR Karma / February 4, 2025 8:15

January 31st 2025 marked the launch of an exciting Kickstarter campaign aimed at transforming the way children learn and grow through storytelling and imaginative play. "The Little Fairy" book series is designed to encourage good behavior, instill positive habits, and actively involve caregivers in their child's development. The Kickstart campaign is attempting to raise funds to cover the cost of printing physical copies of the books along with the development and stocking of the companion fairy dolls. With a target goal of $6,000, the campaign will run from January 31, 2025, to March 31, 2025.

 The series introduces young readers to the enchanting world of "The Little Fairy," a benevolent character who helps children navigate their emotions and embrace positivity. Two books are currently completed: one for use at home and another tailored for classroom settings. These stories weave a magical narrative of how the fairy arrives, collects negative emotions, and replaces them with positive vibes for a brighter tomorrow.

 Distinct from other magical companions, "The Little Fairy" can be touched and hugged, fostering a nurturing and interactive relationship without causing chaos or adhering to strict movement rules. Caregivers are encouraged to participate by leaving personalized notes of encouragement, further guiding children toward positive behavior.

 "The Little Fairy" series promises a total of twelve stories, each exploring different children's experiences and how their fairy supports them. "We're thrilled to bring 'The Little Fairy' to life and offer a resource that not only entertains but also educates and inspires," said Rhiannon McFarling, creator of "The Little Fairy" series. "Through this Kickstarter campaign, we aim to provide families and educators with tools to nurture a child's emotional well-being and encourage positive interactions."

 Backers of the campaign will have the opportunity to be among the first to receive the introductory books, the book series, and Little Fairy doll, along with other exclusive rewards. To learn more about "The Little Fairy" book series and to support the campaign, visit BeThePositive.org
