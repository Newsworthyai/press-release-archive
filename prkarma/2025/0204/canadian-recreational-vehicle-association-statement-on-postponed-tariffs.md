BURLINGTON, ON / PR Karma / February 4, 2025 10:50

Public Statement

 Burlington, ON – February 4th, 2025—The Canadian Recreational Vehicle Association (CRVA) highly welcomes yesterday's announcement that the Canadian and U.S. governments have agreed to postpone the implementation of tariffs for 30 days following productive discussions between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President Donald Trump.

 The CRVA would like to express its appreciation to both administrations for the decision to engage in meaningful dialogue that works towards a resolution that avoids any unnecessary economic disruption. We strongly support these continued discussions to ensure that fair trade policies can remain in place to benefit businesses and consumers on both sides of the border.

 The RV Industry in Canada and the United States has thrived under decades of mutually beneficial free trade policies. The North American RV Industry’s ability to provide our families with outdoor enjoyment is critically dependent on fair and stable trade policies to maintain production, sales, and investment.

 Trade barriers, if implemented, would significantly impact consumers, limit product availability, and reduce industry competitiveness.

 We are optimistic that governments will use this extension period productively to explore equitable solutions that address the concerns of the US and Canada and do not place undue burdens and stress on our businesses and consumers.

 The CRVA remains committed to working with our industry partners, policymakers, and stakeholders to ensure that the interests of RV manufacturers, dealers, and owners are represented in any future trade negotiations.

 If you have any questions, or would like any additional comments please contact our office.

 Sincerely,

 

 Shane Devenish

 President
