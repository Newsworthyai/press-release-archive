# Ambitious duo make history by skiing all Alberta resorts in one season

BANFF, AB / PR Karma / January 23, 2025 14:00

Banff, Alberta (January 24, 2025) – A father & daughter are making ski history again, this time by visiting and skiing all 39 lift-serviced ski areas in Alberta. And they're about to do it in 34 days at the final stop of the provincial-wide ski tour at Mt. Norquay Ski Resort on Sunday, Jan. 26, 2025.

 TO SCHEDULE AN INTERVIEW, CONTACT GREG AT (780) 267-2527.

 Greg Scott, and his daughter Hali, began the journey in the southwest corner of the province late December and have zigged and zagged across the province, meeting local ski legends along the way.

 The tour concept came together last year when Greg and Hali were organizing high school visits throughout B.C. to talk about their Tidbits of Change Foundation Youth Bursaries and to encourage Canadian youths to collaborate with a parent or mentor on unique projects of their own. They decided to ski all the ski areas in the province and ended up becoming the first-ever to ski them all in a single winter – 44 ski areas in 42 days.

 “Our adventure was phenomenal for us last year and we got encouraged to tackle Alberta this winter,” said Greg. “The combination of so many fantastic community hills and incredible mountain resorts in Alberta is really amazing.”

 Their efforts in the mad dash through Alberta has garnered attention on social media, with close to two million interactions on Instagram alone, with the duo’s unique storytelling, such as “Chairlift Chatter” with local ski legends or characters at each ski hill.

 The two will have travelled 8,300 kilometres to complete their epic ski road trip through Alberta.  They have skied at Hidden Valley in the Cypress Hills in the southeast corner of the province.  Pass Powder Keg and Castle Mountain Resort in the southwest corner.  Vista Ridge in Fort McMurray.  Eight ski areas in the northwest, including a visit to Blue Ridge Mountain Resort in La Crete. And everything in between.  “We’re super excited to be capping off our journey in the beautiful Banff area,” added Greg.

 The unique name for The Skadi Tour is a nod to the Norse mythology goddess of snow, skiing, and mountains. The tour was made possible with the support of HEAD skis, Kal-Tire, Descente, Sundance Ski & Snowboard Shop, and Hummingbird Micro Homes.  HEAD and Kal-Tire have also added special youth bursaries to the Tidbits of Change Foundation efforts.
