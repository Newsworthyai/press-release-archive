PORT COQUITLAM, BC / PR Karma / June 24, 2025 12:15

Port Coquitlam, BC – June 24, 2025 – Happy Stan’s Recycling Services Ltd. (HSR) proudly supports the release of Version 8.1 of the Zero Waste Hierarchy of Highest and Best Use, published this month by the Zero Waste International Alliance (ZWIA). This updated version refines one of the most widely adopted global frameworks for Zero Waste strategy, reinforcing best practices that guide organizations, governments, and communities toward more sustainable resource use. It continues to be a leading tool for developing Zero Waste policies, programs, and strategies worldwide.

 As Chair of the ZWIA Zero Waste Hierarchy Working Group and President of Happy Stan’s Recycling Services Ltd., Jamie Kaminski played a direct role in developing this important update.

 “The Zero Waste Hierarchy provides a critical understanding of policies to ensure global alignment with the term ‘Zero Waste,” — Jamie Kaminski, Committee Chair of the Zero Waste Hierarchy Working Group and President of the HSR Zero Waste and HSR Services.

 Key updates in Version 8.1 include: * Strengthened guidance and enhanced language under the Do Not Export Harm principle, ensuring hazardous materials are not sent to regions or facilities unable to manage them responsibly.
* A new principle, Do No Harm, to guide organizations in minimizing the negative social and environmental impacts of materials and discards throughout their lifecycle.
* Updated definitions for circular economy, closed-loop systems, composting, and recycling, offering clearer, more consistent language for global application.

 “These updates provide essential insights to address current issues, including chemical recycling and working toward a circular economy,” said Gary Liss, Chair of the ZWIA Certifications Committee.

 “Conserving resources is our goal. The Hierarchy provides a model,” said Richard Anthony, President of ZWIA.

 As a long-standing Zero Waste advocate, HSR is committed to aligning the services with these updated standards to ensure materials are handled responsibly and ethically throughout their lifecycle.
