ST. LOUIS, MO / PR Karma / January 9, 2025 11:45

St Louis, MO. (January 9, 2025) – RapidFire Safety & Security (RapidFire), the multi-regional “Buy & Build” experts for fire, life safety, and security industries, announced the acquisition of Kane Fire Protection (Kane) in the St. Louis, Metropolitan area. The acquisition of Kane Fire Protection expands RapidFire’s service offerings with the addition of Kane’s fire sprinkler services. This represents RapidFire’s second acquisition in the St. Louis market, where they are also headquartered.

 Kane is a full-service fire protection contractor based in the St. Louis Metro-East, serving both the St. Louis, Missouri and Southern Illinois Metropolitan areas. Kane started in 1999 as a division of Kane Mechanical, which was originally established in 1949 as Kane Plumbing. In 2005, Kane Fire Protection was established as its own entity specializing in fire suppression system design, installation, and testing.    Kane is an ideal addition to the RapidFire family. Following the close, all Kane’s employees will remain with the company, ensuring continuity and a strong presence in the St. Louis market. This addition not only strengthens RapidFire’s footprint in the region but also enhances their ability to offer integrated fire protection and security solutions in this market.

 “Mike and Brian’s interest in helping me grow my business and their plans for growing RapidFire really got me excited about the opportunity to be a part of it,” said Pat Kane, Owner of Kane Fire Protection. “The biggest thing for me is the opportunity to grow and be part of something bigger and better than I could build on my own”.

 Kane is a NICET Level III certified full-service fire protection company. Kane’s full-service installation covers consultations, inspections, engineering, testing, permits, approvals, and design drawings. In addition to fire sprinkler installation for new construction, Kane is an expert in retrofit and upgrades to existing systems, as well as ongoing inspection, test and maintenance.

 "I'm incredibly excited to welcome the talented team from Kane to the RapidFire family," said Mike McLeod, CEO/Founder. "Pat Kane has built a fantastic company with a strong reputation for quality and customer satisfaction. We've long admired Kane Fire, and I'm confident that together, we can achieve even greater things. This acquisition allows us to expand our reach in the St. Louis metro area to better serve our combined customer base, by providing even more comprehensive fire protection solutions. I'm looking forward to working closely with Pat and the entire Kane team as we embark on this exciting new chapter."

 Kane’s top priority is safety. While delivering exceptional customer satisfaction remains a core value, the company is equally committed to installing every system with the highest level of quality. Its skilled workforce, from Sprinkler Fitters Local 268, is composed of professionals who have completed a rigorous, approved five-year apprenticeship program, ensuring expertise and precision in every project.

 “We’re thrilled to join forces with a great operator like Pat to expand our service offering in the St Louis market,” said Adam Lucas of Concentric Equity Partners. “Our partnership with Kane represents a continuation of our core strategy to provide a full spectrum of security and fire protection services across each of our addressable markets”.
