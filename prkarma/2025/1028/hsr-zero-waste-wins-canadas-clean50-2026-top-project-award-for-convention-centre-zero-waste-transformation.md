# HSR Zero Waste Wins Canada’s Clean50 2026 Top Project Award for Convention Centre Zero Waste Transformation

VANCOUVER, BC / PR Karma / October 28, 2025 17:00

HSR Zero Waste is proud to announce that our Convention Centre Zero Waste Transformation Project has been recognized with the 2026 Clean50 Top Project Award, honouring outstanding sustainability initiatives that drive measurable environmental impact across Canada.

 The Clean50 Awards, presented annually by Delta Management Group, celebrate individuals and organizations making significant contributions to climate action, clean innovation, and a net-zero future. The Top Project category highlights innovative initiatives that demonstrate exceptional results in advancing climate action, waste reduction, and circular economy practices.

 HSR Zero Waste’s award-winning project shows the potential of circular systems in large-scale operations. In collaboration with event organizers, facility teams, and stakeholders, the Convention Centre Zero Waste Transformation Project introduced a comprehensive waste diversion and resource recovery model that diverted over one million kilograms of material in a single year. Through the redesign of waste flows, reconfiguration of existing equipment, and implementation of hands-on sorting programs and staff training, the initiative raised the Vancouver Convention Centre’s diversion rate from 50% to between 75–90% in 2024, significantly reducing landfill waste while advancing sustainable event management practices.

 “Canada’s Clean50 Top Project Awards recognize the best sustainability-oriented projects completed in Canada over the past two years,” said Gavin Pitchford, CEO of Delta Management Group. “Projects are chosen based on their measurable impact, innovation, and ability to inspire others to replicate their success — and the Convention Centre Zero Waste Transformation project by Happy Stan’s Recycling Services is a terrific example.”

 This recognition highlights our continued commitment to innovation, collaboration, and measurable environmental progress. We are grateful for the Clean50’s acknowledgment and inspired by the other exceptional leaders and organizations driving sustainability across Canada.

 HSR Zero Waste’s founders, Stan and Della Kaminski, were honoured to represent the company at the Clean50 Summit in Toronto, where more than 160 Clean50 Honourees from across Canada gathered to exchange ideas, celebrate achievements, and discuss the future of climate leadership.

 We were delighted to join the Clean50 Summit 2026 and connect with fellow award recipients and leaders from diverse industries who share the same passion for building a cleaner, more circular future. Congratulations to all of this year’s honourees for their remarkable achievements and collective dedication to climate action!
