PORT COQUITLAM, BC / PR Karma / August 6, 2025 12:15

Port Coquitlam, BC – Aug 6, 2025 – HSR Zero Waste is proud to announce that its President, Jamie Kaminski, has co-authored an op-ed published in Resource Recycling magazine, a leading industry publication in North America. The piece, co-written with Zero Waste International Alliance (ZWIA) vice-chair  Gary Liss, highlights the growing influence of the Zero Waste Hierarchy and the importance of policy frameworks that support it.

 The op-ed, titled "In Our Opinion: Policy leaders should embrace the Zero Waste Hierarchy," underscores the need for governments and institutions to adopt the Hierarchy as a foundational tool for making more strategic and sustainable waste management decisions.

 "Being featured in a publication as respected as Resource Recycling is an honor and a testament to the hard work of our team and the broader zero-waste community," said Jamie Kaminski. "This piece is a call to action for policy leaders to strengthen their commitment to upstream prevention and embrace frameworks that create lasting, positive change for the environment and our economy."

 The article details the recent update to the Zero Waste Hierarchy (Version 8.1), which refines existing definitions, strengthens ethical guidance, and places a clear emphasis on prevention and equity. The co-authors note that these principles are a result of collective insight from zero-waste leaders and organizations around the world, reflecting a growing alignment on effective systems change.
