Montreal, QC – January 16, 2025 – Warren Werbitt, widely known across the industry as The Print Whisperer, is set to revolutionize the podcasting world with his newest project, "Printing’s Alive: The Podcast." Hot on the heels of the success of his book, "Printing’s Alive: A Tale of Ink, Innovation, and Industry Wisdom," Werbitt continues to break boundaries, bringing his unique voice, industry expertise, and storytelling to the podcast audience.

 This isn’t just another podcast about print. With his unfiltered style, Werbitt explores the intersection of print, business, and innovation—shedding light on the human stories and big ideas shaping industries today. From industry challenges to leadership insights, from tales of triumph to candid confessions, no topic is off limits.

 “I’ve always been passionate about print, and this podcast is a way to highlight everything that makes it amazing,” says Werbitt. “Print touches so many lives—from the people who bring it to life to those who experience it—and I’m excited to talk with everyone and remind people that print is far from dead.”

 Each episode of "Printing’s Alive: The Podcast" features bold conversations with print experts, business innovators, and unique personalities. Expect raw, unfiltered discussions that include humor, surprises, and yes, the occasional “F-bomb.”

 PRINTING United Alliance, the most comprehensive member-based printing and graphic arts association in North America, will host, support and promote the podcast to its 20,000 global members in the print and graphic arts community.

 “We are thrilled to bring ‘Printing’s Alive: The Podcast’ to life on our PRINTING United Alliance media channels,” said Dave Leskusky, President of PRINTING United Alliance. “Warren’s passion for print, and his bold, honest approach pairs well with our mission to inspire, educate, and connect the global print community. This podcast offers fresh, engaging content that will resonate with many, and amplify the vibrant stories of innovation and leadership shaping our industry.”

 The podcast kicks off with a power-packed first episode titled "Innovation Nation: How Israeli Companies Are Shaping Print’s Future," featuring three trailblazers in print technology:

 * Ilan Elan, Kornit Digital

 * Eli Grinberg, Co-Founder, Scodix

 * Shlomo Nimrodi, CEO, Highcon

 In the second episode, marketing and media visionary Mitch Joel takes stage to explore "The Evolution of Media and Technology" and how these shifts influence the business world.

 Episode three welcomes Joanne Gore, a print marketing expert, to discuss "The Intersection of Print and Digital in the Marketing World" and why print continues to play a vital role in today’s omnichannel strategies.

 “When I speak, people listen—not because I hold back, but because I don’t. And neither do my guests,” Werbitt shares. “This podcast is for anyone who’s tired of boring, rehearsed discussions. We’re here to shake things up.”

 The podcast officially launches on January 21st, 2025, with new episodes releasing weekly every Tuesday.
