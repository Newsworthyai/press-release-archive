# Counterflow Coffee & Bay City Brewing Celebrate the Release of Witching Hour Coffee Stout -  A Southern California Brew Born From Punk Rock

SAN DIEGO, CA / PR Karma / November 11, 2025 22:45

Counterflow Coffee and Bay City Brewing have come together to create the ultimate Southern California Fall Beer - Witching Hour, a 5.5%ABV Coffee Stout. Creation of this brew was inspired by their shared love of the punk rock spirit of SoCal, and the childhood dream of growing up in San Diego. They wanted to pay homage to the scene, and introduce a beer that can bring nostalgia into something you can taste.

 Local entrepreneurs from Counterflow Coffee once again teamed up with Bay City Brewing, and put their heads together to bring Witching Hour to life. Together, they set out to design a beer that embodies rhythm, taste, and the creative + rebellious energy of Southern California.

 Following the success of last year’s Gambino Coffee Stout, Witching Hour represents the next chapter in Counterflow and Bay City’s creative partnership. It brings the same craftsmanship and attention to detail, but introduces a new balance of intensity. The beer was designed not just to impress coffee and beer connoisseurs, but to connect with the people of Southern California for what it is - imaginative, communal, and full of flavor.

 Gambino Coffee Stout is brewed at a punching  9% ABV. “This time, we wanted something more accessible to the masses. We created a smoother, lighter, and even more coffee-forward flavor,” Austin Pinder, head of brewing at Bay City said. At 5.5% ABV, Witching Hour is brewed to be the perfect companion for any evening, smooth, roasty, and built for the good times. The addition of Counterflow’s signature cold brew brings a fresh, bold aroma and distinct yet subtle espresso character. The result is a beer rich in flavor that captures the energy and nostalgia of growing up in San Diego. “It’s about honoring that punk rock energy that shaped us while keeping it true to San Diego’s craft scene” - Geoff Davis. Witching Hour is the energy that shines through in every sip. While Gambino leaned heavy on liquor and malt, Witching Hour dials back the intensity and brings the coffee flavors forward. It’s still bold-  but more approachable, balanced, and crafted to be shared.

 The Witching Hour release party will take place Thursday November 13th, from 6pm to 9pm at Bay City Brewing's downtown location (627 8th Ave, San Diego, CA 92101). This event is free to the public.

 The event will feature Counterflow Coffee’s iconic espresso martinis. The fans who attended last year might remember the flavors: hazelnut coffee and pumpkin spice. If you want to see the kickin’ flavors of this year, you’ll just have to be there. Witching Hour will be premiered with three bold flavors: Apple Pie, Coconut Macadamia Nut, and the Original Witching Hour.

 The event will also include a food pop-up by ELE Burger, offering the perfect pairing for Witching Hour. Guests can expect great beer, and the gritty atmosphere that embodies the community that defines San Diego.

 Deep within this collaboration lies the creative hand of Counterflow Marketing, the team responsible for bringing Witching Hour’s visual identity and storytelling to life. They wanted the design to channel the wistful edge of SoCal punk. Moody, raw, and undeniably authentic - while giving the brand a modern and refined aesthetic.

 After its launch, Witching Hour will be available on tap at Bay City Brewings Midway and Downtown locations, and distributed to bars and stores throughout Southern California. Whether you’re enjoying a pint by the beach or a six pack at home without your friends. Witching Hour delivers the perfect balance of craft and caffeine, brewed for the nights you don’t want to end.
