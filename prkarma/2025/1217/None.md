# BC Ski Team ready to race, learn, and level up

VANCOUVER, BC / PR Karma / December 17, 2025 18:00

As the 2025-26 ski racing season rapidly approaches, the province’s top skiers are ready to roll and eager to compete.

 Following a productive pre-season that included physical conditioning and on-snow training on two continents, the BC Ski Team coaching staff is optimistic heading into the season, which begins Thursday, Dec. 18, at Panorama, B.C., with the FIS GMC Cup.

 Led by returning BC Ski Team athletes Dylan Stevens, Baptiste Cais and Hannah Jensen, four newcomers have been officially named to the provincial team. The athletes range in age from 16 to 20 and represent four ski clubs from across the province.

 “This crew has been great throughout the preparation, pushing each other to be better every step of the way,” said Morgan Pridy, BC Ski Team head coach.

 Pridy, along with assistant coaches Eric Schwenck and Dillon Prophet, believes the grind of the off-season has strong potential to pay off in the weeks ahead.

 “Each of these athletes has worked hard to raise their level over the past six months,” Pridy said. “If we continue to learn and our effort stays as high as our expectations, this team will have a successful season.”

 BC Alpine vice-president Johnny Crichton said the team is a strong reflection of athletes developed through the BC Alpine and Alpine Canada pathway.

 “This team is a great example of what the BC pathway is all about, from the Nancy Greene Ski League to club FIS programs and onto the BC Ski Team,” he explained. “They are working hard in the gym and on snow, and the coaches have been intentional with every block of training. Clear, athlete-specific performance plans have kept everyone aligned, and they’re ready to race, learn, and keep pushing toward the next level.”

 BC Alpine also recognizes Jasmine Coubrough, who will not return to the BC Ski Team this season due to injury, and acknowledges her commitment and professionalism during her time with the program. “We were fortunate to have Jasmine on the team. She proudly represented the Vernon Ski Club and inspired future racers. We wish her all the best,” said Crichton.
