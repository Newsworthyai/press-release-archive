 The Willingboro foundation serves more than 500 children annually with out of school-time programs that include before-and-after school care; full-day fall, spring and summer programs; and STEAM workshops.

 The All Things Are Possible (ATAP) Foundation, a youth organization serving families in Burlington County, is hosting Black History Month awareness events every Friday in February.

 All programs will be held in Willingboro from 6 to 9 p.m. Dinner will be provided by Smokin Rev and Lady Q's Gourmet Barbeque.

 Each week of events builds on others and culminates in the foundation's Black History Month Gala at The Boro Epicenter on Friday, Feb. 28. Participants will recite poems, paint portraits and explore African American history. Guests will dress up as historical figures they have learned about throughout the month.

 "My true passion is about helping people reach their fullest capacity, and to be the best that they can be to make a difference wherever they are," said Dr. Tiffani Worthy, co-founder of the foundation, CEO and chairwoman of the board.

 Worthy and her husband, Dr. Carlos Worthy, founded the organization in 2007 in response to a critical need to develop youth and equip them to become productive leaders. Carlos is also the foundation's CEO.

 "I know that the work that we're doing here is not just impacting the student, but their family, and the future generations to come from that student," Dr. Tiffani Worthy says of the organization she co-founded.

 "I saw a lot of need when it came to young people being able to have access to programming," Tiffani Worthy recalled, "access to intentional learning and intentional development opportunities, and so my husband and I founded the All Things Are Possible Foundation ... And (we) continue to move forward to be able to help inspire the students and impact them and their families and their communities."

 The ATAP Foundation serves more than 500 children a year with out-of-school-time (OST) programs that include before-and-after-school care; full-day fall, spring and summer programs; STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) workshops; performing arts events; and cultural enrichment programs for students in K-8 and teens.

 The foundation's goal is to help students discover what's possible for them to achieve by broadening their knowledge and experiences beyond the borders of their own community.

 "I know that the work that we're doing here is not just impacting the student but their family, and the future generations to come from that student," Tiffani explained. "Helping the student to overcome their challenges, increasing their self-esteem, increasing self-confidence, increasing their academic skills and social skills, I know that that makes a positive difference in their lives, whether they stay at the ATAP Foundation, stay in Burlington County or go beyond."
