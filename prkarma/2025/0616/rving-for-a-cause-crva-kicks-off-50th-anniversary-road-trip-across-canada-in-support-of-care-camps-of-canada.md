# RVing for a Cause: CRVA Kicks Off 50th Anniversary Road Trip Across Canada in support of Care Camps of Canada

BURLINGTON, ON / PR Karma / June 16, 2025 9:00

Burlington, Ontario — To mark 50 years in Canada’s RV industry, the Canadian Recreational Vehicle Association (CRVA) is hitting the road this summer!

 Starting today, June 16th, CRVA's President Shane Devenish is setting off on a cross-country tour in their 50th-anniversary wrapped 2025 Citation Reward Travel Trailer by General Coach to celebrate their half century birthday, the freedom of the RV lifestyle, connect with fellow Canadians, and raise funds for Care Camps Foundation, a Canadian charity that helps to send children with cancer to healing camp experiences.

 This coast-to-coast journey will not only be just about the 50-year milestone—it's about meeting RV'ers where they are, hearing their stories, and giving back in a truly meaningful way.

 The RV lifestyle continues to grow in popularity across Canada. Whether it’s a weekend away or a full cross-country trip, more than 2.1 million Canadian households now own an RV. RVing allows Canadians to explore our scenic destinations, unplug from daily stress, and support our small communities.

 It’s also a major driver of our economy—the RV industry contributes over $3.4 billion annually and supports more than 14,000 jobs nationwide, from manufacturing to campground operations.

 CRVA's RV will be making several stops throughout the summer journey at Campgrounds and RVDA Dealerships along the way, including at our good friends Transcona Trailer Sales in Winnipeg, Manitoba, for their Open House on June 20th.

 From there, CRVA will be at Western Country RV in Airdrie at the end of June before Joss Penny from British Columbia Lodging and Campgrounds Association gets the keys to head west to Traveland RV in Langley and the Vancouver Craft Beer and Music Festival on July 12th with Go RVing Canada.

 Then it's back east again to be part of the Boots and Hearts Festival August 7th-10th, and wrapping up at the legendary Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) in Toronto from August 26 – September 1st, before returning to our home base at Rustons RV Centre in Burlington.

 At every stop, CRVA invites folks to come see the trailer in person, talk to them about their RV lifestyle memories, and if you find a way, buy a ticket to support Care Camps and a chance to win this fabulous trailer valued at over $100,000.

 Every ticket sold will help send a child to Care Camps, and every dollar raised goes directly to this amazing cause.

 “When we started planning this journey a year ago, we knew we wanted to do something meaningful for our 50th year,” said Shane Devenish, President of CRVA. “We wanted to celebrate our roots, promote everything we love about the RV lifestyle, and find a way to give back to our community. We decided on Care Camps, a charity that truly makes a difference in children's lives."

 "RVing is such a big part of Canadian life—from the family road trips to weekend getaways—and I am excited to experience this for myself, first hand.  l am looking forward to seeing all of the friendly faces across the country—and if you see our rig on the road or at a campground, give a wave or drop by and say hello or snap a photo, and post it using #CRVA50 for a chance to win some fun prizes!”

 We will be sharing updates throughout the trip on our social channels @canadianrvassociation, highlighting some of Canada’s historical landmarks on the journey, our scenic routes, and the many moments that make RVing so special.

 So whether you’re a seasoned RVer or dreaming of starting, we hope this tour will inspire you to get out there, explore Canada, and embrace the freedom of the open road. Because the best memories are made when we slow down, turn off the map, and just enjoy the ride.

 From music festivals to campgrounds, this summer will truly be all about connection, celebration, and community engagement!

 We will be available for media interviews throughout the journey, so don’t hesitate to reach out if you'd like to cover a stop or learn more about CRVA’s mission, history or more about Care Camps of Canada.

 See y'all on the open road!
