# Care to Make a Mark with The Givers

ATLANTA, GA / PR Karma / May 5, 2024 11:09

Award-winning gospel singer and television host Trish Standley, in partnership with the nonprofit organization Walk in My Shoes Foundation, announces the first-ever community event, "Care for the Giver." With caregivers being the backbone of long-term holistic adult care, "Care for the Giver" generates awareness, educates communities about caregiving, and highlights caregivers' invaluable multidimensional roles and contributions.

 The event occurs on Sunday, September 29, 2024, at Occasions on Main in Lithonia, GA. From 12:00pm through 1:00pm, there will be a Meet and Greet session, followed by a live taping of "Trish Standley TV" featuring special guests from 1:00pm – 4:00pm. Attendees can expect an informative panel discussion featuring top industry experts specialized in caregiving. The panelists will cover topics ranging from estate planning, in-home care, facility care, and psychological well-being to emotional support and companionship. Additionally, a human resource professional offers insights to support caregivers in their workplace.

 "Care for the Giver" welcomes the esteemed Mayor of Lithonia, Shemeka Reynolds, former District 3 Commissioner Lorraine Cochran-Johnson, and 95.5 FM and AM 750 WSB Atlanta anchor Michelle Wright, all of whom will attend to show their support and applaud the tremendous work of caregivers.

 What often was overlooked is that caregivers now play an integral role in the ever-changing healthcare landscape. According to Careforth, about 53 million family caregivers actively ensure older adults maintain their quality of life while navigating health, aging, or disability challenges. Equitable policies centered around medical guidance, aid, and financial support are being advocated and eventually passed across legislative levels.

 Standley and Walk in My Shoes CEO Helen Castille Fusilier collaborated on "Care for the Giver" due to their unwavering dedication to bringing caregiving resources to underserved communities and the progress they have made in this regard. Fusilier's nonprofit Walk in My Shoes provides financial and emotional support to patients undergoing cancer treatment.

 After the panel, the public can win exciting sponsor prices, including massages, skincare treatments, nail services, fitness consultations, and body contouring. Also, one lucky recipient will be awarded a special "Queen of the Day" pamper experience consisting of a beauty and fashion makeover with a celebrity stylist, culminating in a professional photoshoot.

 Overall, this day is about the caregivers receiving the complete admiration and rejuvenation they deserve. "Love isn’t Love unless you give it away," singer and TV host Trish Standley stated.
