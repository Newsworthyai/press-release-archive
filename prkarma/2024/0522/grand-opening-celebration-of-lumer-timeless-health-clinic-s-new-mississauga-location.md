Lumèr - Timeless Health Clinic is delighted to announce the Grand Opening of its second location in Mississauga, Ontario. The celebration will take place on Friday, May 24, from 12:00 PM to 4:00 PM at the Medical Arts Center, 71 King St W., Unit 400, Mississauga, L5B4A2.

 Lumèr - Timeless Health Clinic strives to be at the forefront of holistic health, offering some of the most cutting-edge treatments and methods. Our goal is to educate the community on how to take charge of their own health and wellness. This grand opening event is a perfect opportunity for attendees to learn more about these advanced treatments and how they can benefit their well-being.

 Attendees can look forward to a range of complimentary services and special features, including Visia skin analysis performed by our expert Naturopathic Doctor, and mini facials offered on a first-come, first-served basis. An AlumierMD representative will be on-site to provide skincare education, ensuring guests leave with valuable insights into maintaining healthy, radiant skin.

 In addition to these services, the event will feature exclusive, event-only promotions and two raffles for gift baskets filled with premium products. One basket will include AlumierMD skincare products, while the other will be stocked with Bioclinic Naturals professional-grade supplements.

 To enhance the celebratory atmosphere, guests can enjoy a variety of refreshments, including collagen "shots" and collagen coffees by CanPrev. Goodie bags filled with skincare treats will also be available while supplies last.

 Dr. Yelena Deshko first opened the flagship clinic in downtown Toronto over a decade ago. The clinic's popularity has steadily grown, with a 2-week waitlist for certain treatments and patients coming from across Ontario, and even flying internationally on occasion. Recognizing the strong demand, Lumèr decided to expand and open more locations.

 “At Lumèr, we are committed to offering personalized, high-quality health and wellness services. Our new location in Mississauga enables us to extend our exceptional care to a broader community,” said Dr. Yelena Deshko, founder of Lumèr - Timeless Health Clinic. “It’s been an honor to share the beauty of naturopathic medicine with our clients. I’ve been amazed myself by just how transformative some treatments can be for those who really need it. I especially learned a lot while working with cancer patients one-on-one with our unique naturopathic cancer care program."

 Since its inception, Lumèr - Timeless Health Clinic has been dedicated to providing holistic and effective health solutions. The success of our first location has paved the way for this expansion, and we are eager to bring our services to the vibrant Mississauga community.

 “We are excited to welcome journalists and other media outlets to attend the event and learn more about our innovative approach to health and wellness,” added Dr. Deshko.
