BROOMFIELD, CO / PR Karma / September 18, 2024 13:00

The Digital Frontier, a full-service commercial and fine-art printer specializing in large-format and digital print solutions, congratulates owner Sara Schaeffner on her recent win of Big Picture Magazine’s 2024 Women in Wide Format Awards. The awards were announced at the 2024 PRINTING United Expo, which took place from September 10-12, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

 Schaeffner was one of six winners announced by Big Picture—the leading resource for the wide-format digital print market—as part of their ninth annual awards ceremony. The awards celebrate women who have made a difference in advancing the wide-format digital print industry, and included Allison Kast Eichenberg, owner of Signarama Chandler; Maggie Payette Harlow, CEO/owner of Signarama Downtown; Kelley Mattingly, owner of Signarama; Shirley Dyson, owner of Signco; and Kim Howell, VP/director of operations of Tiny Mammoth Graphics.

 “As a relative newcomer to the industry, I’m delighted to be listed alongside the other winners of this year’s awards and to support women-owned businesses in general,” Schaeffner said. “In my case, this award belongs in part to the excellent team that I get to work with every day, and who bring over 200 years of collective experience and an overall joy for the industry to our business.”

 Before purchasing The Digital Frontier in 2020, Schaeffner held executive leadership roles in a range of industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, and IT. She’s brought that enterprise experience to the print business, building on her team’s experience and knowledge to become a full-service printer with four specialized divisions: The Digital Frontier for commercial large and small format print, Photo Craft Imaging for gallery-quality fine-art prints, Rosario Custom Framing for beautiful and functional art displays, and Show & Tell for tradeshow booths and event graphics that attract attention. Operating out of a 20,000-square-foot production facility in the heart of the Rockies, they make digital dreams meet printed reality.

 “At The Digital Frontier we combine big vision with big printers,” Schaeffner said. “The business has operated for 30 years, printing on paper, metal, vinyl, wood, glass, acrylic, and PVC—producing any print product you can imagine. Our work is displayed everywhere from art galleries to office buildings to sports stadiums. I couldn’t be prouder of everything we’ve achieved, and everything we’re still achieving.”
