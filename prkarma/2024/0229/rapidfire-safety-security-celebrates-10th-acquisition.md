ST. LOUIS, MO / PR Karma / February 29, 2024 9:54

St. Louis, MO. (DATE, 2024) – RapidFire Safety & Security (RapidFire), the multi-regional “Buy & Build” experts for fire, life safety, and security industries, announces the acquisition of Troy Alarm, a Fire Alarm and Security Services provider based in Riverside, California. This represents the 10th acquisition for the RapidFire platform since its inaugural acquisition in September 2022. This strategic move underscores RapidFire's commitment to expanding its footprint and enhancing its service offerings to better serve communities across the region; and solidifies RapidFire as a premier curator of people-centric, family-built businesses in the fire safety and security sector.

 Since 1989, Troy Alarm has evolved as a full-service security integrator. Troy’s focus on customer service and relationship development in their local market has been paramount to their success. The acquisition underscores RapidFire's dedication to delivering cutting-edge solutions and ensuring a seamless experience for its clientele. As part of the transition, it is anticipated that all Troy Alarm employees will continue to be key members of the company post-close, playing a crucial role in maintaining and expanding RapidFire's footprint and capabilities in Southern California.

 "I got to the point where I was working too many hours and needed to make a change,” said Greg Hillman, President of Troy Alarm. “We started to look around for potential buyers who wouldn't completely dissolve my business and were introduced to Mike McLeod and the RapidFire team.”

 Troy is an established provider of fire and intrusion alarm systems, access control, video surveillance, UL fire alarm certs, and central station monitoring, making them an ideal and valuable addition to the RapidFire platform. Troy serves customers in the commercial, industrial, educational, and government markets throughout Greater Southern California’s Inland Empire. By combining expertise and resources, RapidFire aims to set new standards of excellence in the industry.

 “My wife and I both work a lot of hours,” said Greg. “We didn't have the resources or the time to grow the business like I wanted to see it grow. RapidFire will give us the ability to build the company to its full potential."

 "By welcoming the Troy team into RapidFire, we're strategically bolstering our presence in Southern California.” stated Brian Modglin, RapidFire’s Chief Operating Officer. “This symbolic acquisition signifies a deliberate effort to enhance our team's expertise, broaden our range of solutions, and ultimately better serve our community. I anticipate this collaboration will yield significant benefits as we collectively strive for excellence in the realm of life safety."
