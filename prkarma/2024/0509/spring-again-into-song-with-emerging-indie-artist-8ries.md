Argo Vibes, a pioneering black-woman-owned multimedia and talent organization, announces the official debut of "The Spring Song (Spring Again)" by the talented 8RIES on Friday, May 10, 2024.  The song will be available on all major platforms.

 8RIES, a visionary film composer and singer-songwriter, is poised to captivate audiences with her debut single, a unique composition that beautifully encapsulates a transformative spring afternoon. Drawing inspiration from spring's symbolic renewal and joyful essence, "Spring Song" vividly portrays an afternoon where the sun's rays dance with cherry blossoms, interrupted by a refreshing rain shower, only to return to sunshine again. This single is a testament to 8RIES's narrative style, a fusion of her love for Disney-esque musical tales and her lyrical prowess.

 With a profound admiration for animation and storytelling, 8RIES works with aspiring animators to bring her projects to life and create enchanting experiences that resonate with all ages. Her aspirations to collaborate with industry conglomerates such as Disney, Netflix, In The Black Network, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network underscore her commitment to crafting content that entertains and inspires the next generation.
