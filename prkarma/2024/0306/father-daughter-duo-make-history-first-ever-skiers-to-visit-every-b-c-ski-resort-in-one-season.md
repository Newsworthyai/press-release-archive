# Father-daughter duo make history: First-ever skiers to visit every B.C. ski resort in one season

VERNON, BC / PR Karma / March 6, 2024 10:28

SILVER STAR RESORT, B.C (March 4, 2024) – The Skadi Tour – in support of the Tidbits of Change Foundation – is closing in on a historic feat: to visit all 44 lift-serviced ski areas in B.C. in 42 days.

 Greg Scott, and his daughter Hali, began the journey in Terrace, B.C., on Jan. 25th and will conclude the provincial-wide ski tour on Wednesday, March 6, 2024 at Silver Star Resort, near Vernon, B.C.

 The tour concept came together when Greg and Hali were organizing high school visits throughout the province to talk about their Tidbits of Change Foundation bursaries and to encourage Canadian youths to collaborate with a parent or mentor on unique projects of their own.

 “We started to look at the possibility of visiting all the ski areas during the day while visiting schools or parent advisory councils in the late afternoons or evenings," said Greg. "When we mapped out that there were 42 ski areas, we came up with the crazy notion to try to ski all of them in 42 days.”

 The effort rapidly garnered fast attention on social media as their journey unfolded, with hundreds of thousands of interactions on Instagram (810,000 impressions over the 5 weeks, with the top performing post reaching 14,000 likes and 376 comments) and Facebook with the duo’s unique storytelling, such as “Chairlift Chatter” with local ski legends or characters at each ski hill.

 The two travelled with their own short-term ski home, a custom-built tiny house, by Hummingbird Micro Homes. "It has been getting lots of double-takes on the highways and in the ski area parking lots," added Scott. The home features sleeping for three, water-storage, incinerator toilet, ski trim and guitar holder, ski lockers, boot warmers, après ski charcuterie table and Starlink connection. Hummingbird will be selling the unique home once the tour has been completed.

 Along the way, the adventurers added two surprise ski stops to their original list. When they descend down the slopes of SilverStar on Wednesday, they will have conquered all 44 lift-serviced ski areas in B.C. in just 42 days, after “discovering” two ski areas during the journey. It is believed to be the first time anyone has ever accomplished this feat.

 "We’re excited to host Greg and Hali for the last stage of their historic journey," said Doug Chimuk, SilverStar Marketing Manager. "Their passion for skiing is inspiring and our mountain community is excited to welcome them and share in some of their adventure."

 As luck would have it, Greg and Hali arrivie at SilverStar at the perfect time, just as the resort reached 200 cm for the season. Said Chimuk; "Perfect conditions to cap this incredible achievement!"

 The unique name for The Skadi Tour is a nod to the Norse mythology goddess of snow, skiing, and mountains. The tour was made possible with the support of HEAD skis, Kal-Tire, and Hummingbird Micro Homes, who have also added special youth bursaries to the Tidbits of Change Foundation efforts.
