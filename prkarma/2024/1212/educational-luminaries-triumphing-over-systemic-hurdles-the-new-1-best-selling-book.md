Y Communicate proudly announces the successful launch of “Educational Luminaries: Triumphing Over Systemic Hurdles,” a groundbreaking book that addresses critical challenges in the U.S. public education system. Published by B-Global Publishing House, this thought-provoking publication also provides actionable solutions and a fresh approach to reconstructing the academic landscape.

 "Educational Luminaries: Triumphing Over Systemic Hurdles" has achieved remarkable success, securing the #1 Kindle spot in multiple categories and ranking among Amazon's Top 5 print sales.

 Among the twelve extraordinary co-authors is Y Communicate's Founder and Principal, Yesenia Reinoso, who contributed a compelling chapter titled "Bridging the Gap: Re-integrating Media Literacy into Public Education." From pages twelve through seventeen, Reinoso's chapter explores innovative strategies for interweaving media literacy into school curriculums, emphasizing the intersectionality of corporate communications and academia. The chapter offers best practices and curriculum integration tactics and highlights the unique perspective of how storytelling and partnerships with the communications industry can foster more media-literate generations.

 The release of "Educational Luminaries" caps off a banner year for Reinoso. Throughout 2024, she has been recognized with several prestigious industry awards, featured in notable business magazine publications, and served as a sought-after speaker at in-person and virtual conferences. On November 21-25, Reinoso was also a featured speaker at the Global Visionaries Convention in Dallas, Texas. She delivered an impactful 10-minute presentation on media literacy and participated in a live radio segment with host Dr. Angelica Benavides. On November 23, she, alongside other fellow co-authors, received the esteemed Beacon of Educational Innovation Award, recognized for their innovative leadership and contributions.

 "Becoming part of the bestselling book is a milestone I never expected, but it has deepened my commitment to advocate for media literacy. In today's information age, equipping young minds with critical thinking tools is more important than ever," stated Yesenia Reinoso, Founder and Principal of Y Communicate.
