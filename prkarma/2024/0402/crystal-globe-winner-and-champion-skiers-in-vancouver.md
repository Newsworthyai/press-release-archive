 VANCOUVER, BC (April 2, 2024) – Fresh off winning the pinnacle award in ski racing, the Crystal Globe, Marielle Thompson is back on home soil alongside an impressive roster of her podium-winning teammates to celebrate a record-setting season and to launch a new fundraising initiative in support of ski racing in British Columbia.

 Thompson, of Whistler, B.C., earned her fourth Crystal Globe (awarded by the International Ski Federation [FIS] to the overall World Cup winner) after scorching the back half of the ski season, winning the last four ski cross races. She is now tied for first all-time in FIS season titles to go along with 31 World Cup victories and 67 podiums. Thompson, who grew up racing with the Whistler Mountain Ski Club, is also the 2019 world champion, Olympic champion from the Sochi 2018 Games and Olympic silver medalist from the Beijing 2022 Games.

 The Canadian ski cross team recently claimed its third consecutive Nations Cup title, and the seventh in nine years. Canada has won 11 out of 17 total Nations Cups. Other CANskiteam athletes will be at the event, including world championship medalist Cameron Alexander, two-time ski cross Crystal Globe winner Reece Howden and two time Paralympic medalist and eight-time Paralympic medalist Mollie Jepsen.
