# Trish Standley TV Celebrates 10 Years of Media, Entertainment, and Fashion Evolution

ATLANTA, GA / PR Karma / June 18, 2024 10:15

Formerly known as Style with Trysh, a new era begins with the media entity's relaunch, now known as Trish Standley TV. What started as an online radio show in the spring of 2014, hosted by acclaimed Gospel singer Trish Standley, has blossomed into a dynamic television platform dedicated to inspirational stories, uplifting messaging, and cutting-edge style. The newly launched Trish Standley TV will focus on programming centered on women's empowerment, fashion, and community engagement.

 Trish Standley TV stems from Standley's passion for fashion and her desire to highlight boutique finds and emerging designers. From its humble beginnings as a 30-minute radio show on Sundays, Style with Trysh quickly gained momentum, becoming part of the Survival Radio Network and 108 Praise Radio. Today, the show's format expansion includes fashion highlights, stylish features, makeup artists' spotlight corners, and discussions surrounding female motivation.

 In 2018, Mark Squared Studios partnered with Standley to produce its first season. Throughout the years, Style with Trysh has had the privilege of hosting a diverse array of guests, including actresses Jasmine Guy, Kim Fields, Christine Horn, and Charmine Lee, comedian Shawty Shawty, and influencers Destiny Payton, Latrice Pace, and Kiana Dancie.

 As it embarks on its third season, the show undergoes a rebrand to Trish Standley TV to better reflect its mission and progression. The primary objective of Trish Standley TV continues to uphold its commitment to motivating women and celebrating individuality. The motto – This is where the everyday woman reigns – features inspirational guests who’d overcome adversity and industry experts to elevate us further.

 To commemorate this milestone, Trish Standley TV opens the new season with a special community event, “Care for the Giver,” scheduled for Sunday, September 29th. The event will honor and support caregivers within communities and thank them for their invaluable contributions.

 “It’s never too late to pursue a dream,” stated TV personality Trish Standley.
