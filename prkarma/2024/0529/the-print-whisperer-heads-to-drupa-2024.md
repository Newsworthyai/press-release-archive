Montréal, Québec — May 24, 2024 — Warren Werbitt, widely recognized in the printing industry as "The Print Whisperer," is excited to announce his attendance at Drupa 2024, the world's largest trade show for printing technologies. This marks a significant occasion, as the event returns for the first time in eight years, bringing together pioneers and innovators from across the globe.

 Warren has a keen interest in exploring the latest advancements in printing technology, equipment, and processes. With a career spanning over three decades, his expertise and passion for the printing industry make him particularly eager to delve into the innovations that will shape the future of print.

 "I am thrilled to be part of Drupa 2024," said Warren. "This event is a fantastic opportunity to not only catch up with old friends, but also to forge new relationships within the industry. I am particularly looking forward to the myriad of ideas and inspirations I hope to gather here to help more small printers grow and scale."

 Warren's latest program, "How to Fish for New Business: a 60-minute session with The Print Whisperer," is designed to foster candid, impactful discussions between print business owners. Combining his passions for fishing, business, print, music, sales, and joy of life, Warren aims to help small to mid-sized business owners tighten up operations, make their shops more efficient, and create a healthier workplace culture.

 "Small printers have been beaten up badly over the last few years," says Warren. "I'm here to help them become more efficient, streamlined, and profitable."

 Drupa provides a unique platform for professionals to share insights, challenges, and successes. Warren will be offering one-on-one conversations at the event to discuss how his new program will help printers scale their businesses through better efficiency and streamlined processes.

 Whether you need a fractional CEO, a confidante on speed-dial, or just a fishing guide, Warren is ready to provide actionable recommendations and support – for less than the cost of a business dinner.
