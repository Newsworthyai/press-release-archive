# Optek Films Launch Takes Automotive Industry by Storm with Disruptive Pricing

SAN DIEGO, CA / PR Karma / August 8, 2024 15:15

As the cost of products for automotive shop owners continues to rise, there is an increasing demand for premium products at lower prices without compromising the industry's quality standards. Introducing Optek Films: a newly established, American-owned and operated automotive films company, committed to providing premium quality products at competitive prices.

 Optek Films was established in response to the escalating costs of materials in the market, which have made it increasingly difficult for shop owners to turn a profit. Unlike many other brands that justify premium prices through an array of ancillary services such as training, consulting, or exclusivity agreements, Optek Films focuses solely on delivering exceptional prices for high quality products. The company places high importance on accessibility - making it easier than ever for shop owners to get the professional products they need without an extensive level of prerequisites to purchase. Without assigning installer territories or demanding brand exclusivity, Optek Films is available for all professionals to purchase.

 The mission of Optek Films is to provide the highest quality products at the most competitive prices. The founders are shop owners themselves, and they understand the unique challenges faced by professionals in the industry. This deep industry insight has driven them to create a company where professionals can easily access the products they need, receive them promptly, and continue with their business operations without unnecessary delays or offerings.

 Optek Films offers a range of professional-grade products tailored to meet the demands of industry professionals. The product line includes the following:

 Paint Protection Film (PPF): Available in both Matte and Gloss finishes, Optek’s PPF products offer superior protection and aesthetic enhancement for vehicles, and is known for having superior tack, allowing for outer edges to hold better than many other brands.

 * Product Dimensions:   72" roll x 50'   60" roll x 50'   36" roll x 100'

 These options provide flexibility for different applications, ensuring that professionals can find the perfect fit for their projects. Optek’s Gloss PPF offers superior protection while maintaining the vehicle's original shine, making it an ideal choice for preserving the aesthetic appeal and value of vehicles.

 Matte PPF is also offered under the same product size specifications, which provides the same level of protection while giving vehicles a unique and sophisticated look. Their commitment to quality ensures that both Matte and Gloss PPF products, covered by a 10-year warranty, deliver excellent durability and performance meeting the high standards expected by industry professionals.

 Ceramic IR Window Film: Ceramic IR Window Film not only reduces glare but also protects the interior from fading and deterioration caused by UV exposure. Its advanced technology ensures clear visibility and long-lasting performance, making it an ideal choice for professionals seeking a top-tier window film solution.

 * Roll Lengths: 20", 40", and 60"
* VLT Levels: 5%, 20%, 35%, 50%, 70%

 Color Stable Window Film: Optek’s best value film, Color Stable, is designed to retain its color and clarity over time, ensuring a consistent appearance without the risk of discoloration.
