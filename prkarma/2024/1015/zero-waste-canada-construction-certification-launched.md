# Zero Waste Canada Construction Certification Launched

PORT COQUITLAM, BC / PR Karma / October 15, 2024 18:50

Vancouver, BC  – Oct. 15, 2024 – HSR Zero Waste, in collaboration with Zero Waste Canada and with support from a BC Housing grant, is proud to announce the development of a groundbreaking Zero Waste construction certification tailored specifically for individual construction projects. This certification, formally recognized for its adherence to internationally accepted Zero Waste principles and practices, establishes a new benchmark for sustainable construction.

 The certification process is divided into three phases:

 Introductory Video: This initial phase provides a comprehensive overview of the Zero Waste construction principles and practices. It sets the stage for understanding the goals and requirements of the certification process.

 Documenting Your Construction: After requesting 'the resource,' project teams document their construction activities using this specialized resource. Upon submission, they receive a certificate of achievement, recognizing their efforts in following Zero Waste practices.

 Zero Waste Construction Certification: For a formal review fee, projects can submit more detailed information to receive the full Zero Waste Construction Certification. This phase involves a thorough review to ensure adherence to all certification standards.

 The process begins with a comprehensive analysis of a project's demolition, renovation, and construction activities. This in-depth examination covers the creation of built spaces, whether single or multiple buildings, on a single property. By understanding these activities, a feedback system is introduced to inform targeted actions, ensuring more sustainable practices at every step.

 Key decision makers in construction are empowered to identify and seize opportunities to avoid waste and toxins from the outset. The process ensures proper management of discards and toxic materials generated during demolition or construction phases, and it aims to prevent future waste generation if demolition is required.

 Zero Waste Canada, the Canadian National Affiliate of the Zero Waste International Alliance (ZWIA), supports the certification process. This partnership ensures that responsible construction projects receive formal validation for their efforts, helping to distinguish genuine and documented applications of "Zero Waste" from inconsistent or misleading claims.

 "The Zero Waste construction certification is a significant milestone for the industry," said Jamie Kaminski, President of HSR Zero Waste. "It not only recognizes projects that are committed to sustainable practices but also sets a benchmark for others to follow. Our collaboration with Zero Waste Canada reinforces our commitment to promoting environmental stewardship in construction."

 The certification serves the dual purpose of encouraging sustainable construction practices and providing a reliable standard for what constitutes Zero Waste in the industry. By adopting these principles, construction projects can significantly reduce their environmental impact and contribute to a more sustainable future.
