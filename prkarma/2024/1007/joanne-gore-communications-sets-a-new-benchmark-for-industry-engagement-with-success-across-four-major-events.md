INNISFIL, ON / PR Karma / October 7, 2024 4:50

Joanne Gore Communications (JGC), a full-service B2B marketing agency, helped clients make waves this September, simultaneously participating in three major industry events during the second week of the month, followed by the Xplor 2024 Summit to cap off the month. In doing so, the team at JGC demonstrated its ability to engage on multiple fronts, setting a new benchmark for comprehensive market outreach.

 Altogether, the JGC team:

 * Orchestrated the inaugural VIP Showcase at Xeikon's Innovation Center in Elgin, Illinois, showcasing Xeikon’s newest technologies.
* Managed Xeikon’s North American Launch of TITON 500 + Kurz Integration at PRINTING United Expo
* Managed Rochester Software Associates presence at PRINTING United Expo 2024 in Las Vegas.
* Presented educational sessions in Xeikon booth at PRU, and at the Xplor 2024 Summit in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.

 “Our performance across these events underscores our dedication to excellence in every aspect of event management and client engagement. We sparked valuable discussions and stirred engagement that will have a lasting impact on the industry,” said Joanne Gore, President of Joanne Gore Communications.

 Xeikon Shines at Three Separate Events

 For Xeikon, the VIP Showcase exceeded expectations, with nearly 100 attendees, while Labelexpo Americas and PRINTING United Expo allowed the company to expand their reach even further. The JGC team played a pivotal role in all three events, leading the announcement and demonstration of the North American debut of the TITON TX500 digital press, the ONLY food-safe, single-pass, in-line and sustainable 'digital metal' process in collaboration with KURZ Digital Embellishment Solutions. - thus opening new market opportunities in label and packaging printing.

 "Partnering with Joanne Gore Communications has been one of the best decisions I've made this year. Their expertise, from design to daily execution and everything in between, has elevated our marketing efforts, helping us connect more effectively with our audience and drive meaningful results for Xeikon." — Mark Pomerantz, Sales & Marketing Director, Xeikon.

 Rochester Software Associates Stands Out at PRINTING United

 To help make RSA’s PRINTING United Expo 2024 booth stand out among 800 exhibitors, the JGC team helped plan, organize, and craft compelling messaging and outreach. This ensured RSA, provider of production print workflow software solutions for in-plant print centers, commercial printers, and PSPs, had a strong presence at one of the year’s largest events for printing and graphic arts professionals.

 Taktiful and JGC Put on a Powerful Presentation

 To round out the second week of September, JGC collaborated with Kevin Abergel, Founder and CEO of Taktiful – the digital embellishment experts – to present at Xeikon’s PRINTING United booth. The industry trends session explored the power of embellishments in labels and packaging, and the tactile connection it creates with consumers.

 A Strong Finish at the Xplor CCM Summit

 Joanne's presence at the Xplor 2024 CCM Summit, helped finish the month off on a strong note with a discussion on Transforming Postal Mail with AI: Strategies for Success, which she co-presented with Mike Porter. She was also a panel moderator for: Future-Proofing CCM: Strategies for Tomorrow’s Challenges. As event chair, Joanne also delivered the Summit's opening and closing remarks. Joanne Gore Communications is proud to be a Sapphire sponsor of Xplor - providing morning and afternoon tea service alongside Platinum sponsor Gimbel & Associates – the event’s official beverage sponsor.

 “If you happen to spot a JGC team member in bright orange running around a showroom or event floor, remember that JGC’s mission is to help the print industry sell more print,” Joanne added. “My team is always eager to chat about the marketing strategies that can drive your business forward.”
