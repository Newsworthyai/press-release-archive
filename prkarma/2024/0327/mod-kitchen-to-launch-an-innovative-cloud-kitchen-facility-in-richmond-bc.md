RICHMOND, BC / PR Karma / March 27, 2024 12:28

RICHMOND BC, March 26, 2024: MOD Kitchen is set to launch 10 hygienic, state-of-the-art, private cloud (sometimes referred to as a ‘ghost’ kitchen) kitchens featuring a commercial beverage store, in Q3 2024, capitalising on the direct-to-consumer (DTC) delivery industry shift.

 With substantial advantages over a traditional restaurant model, MOD Kitchens provides food businesses with customizable kitchen facilities, plus on-site support staff, full concierge, cleaning services and utilities to ramp up quickly to meet the growing demand for DTC food delivery options.

 “We are not here to replace the traditional brick-and-mortar restaurants. But simply providing a cost-effective and revenue-generating solution to the ever-growing cost of doing business in the F&B world," said Tony Ferreira, Co-Founder. “MOD Kitchen is also about building and expanding your brand in Richmond, which we call our home,” he added.

 Ferreira, along with Co-Founders Dennis Ng and Adrian Leung are set to partner with local entrepreneurs, restaurants and food brands who are looking to expand their reach and serve customers in a new way, with 10 private kitchens and full capabilities of the beverage store available for the summer 2024 launch. “We’ve had a lot of initial interest,” said Ng. “We’ve already signed on two tenets with a strong presence in the Vancouver region. There’s no better time to enter the market here and the popularity of delivery continues to grow,” said Leung.
